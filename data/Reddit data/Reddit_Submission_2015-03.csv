15-03-01,Picking Stocks vs. Index Funds vs. Robo-Advisors,"I often hear people talking about how the average investor can't beat the market, and that they are better off putting their money in index funds or robo-advisors. But the people who make these claims seem to provide no proof to back them up. If an average investor does well over time, they claim it's luck, or that they took on too much risk. How do you convince skeptics that it's possible to beat the market investing in stocks? Are the people making these claims working for the Vanguards and Wealthfronts of the world? Are they trying to make the average investor think they can't go it alone?

What are your thoughts on this matter? Have you done well investing in stocks?",11
15-03-01,Excessive transactions on Vanguard,"I just echanged one fund for another on vanguard.com then went to purchase more of the share I exchanged out of and got this message:

&gt;Excessive transactions can disrupt the management of a fund and increase the fund's costs for all shareholders. To prevent this disruption, purchases or exchanges back into non-ETF share classes of this fund by phone or online aren't permitted for 60 days after this sale. However, you can make transactions by U.S. mail. This limitation expires on 05/01/2015. The Frequent-Trading Limitations section of the fund's prospectus explains these limits in full. You can also access our Frequent Trading Policy by searching on vanguard.com.

Just wanted to warn others so they don't make the same mistake I did.

For anyone interested, I wanted to purchase VGTSX but did not want to put $3,000 of cash to meet the minimum so I was going to exchange out $2,000 VFIAX.  I exchanged $3,000 of VFIAX for VGTSX and then was going to purchase $1,000 of VFIAX and then I received this message.

I am thinking that I will just contribute spare cash each paycheck to this account until I reach $10,000 admiral, by then I should be beyond 60 days.  I like the international stock fund right now because the euro is in the toilet and the S&amp;P 500 has been outperforming international for a long time.  Any comments are appreciated.

Thank you.",21

3/2 Watchlist

**HMNY** is now extremely illiquid. It had a little squeeze into the close on friday (normal for fridays, especially after a big runup). I will be shorting a green to red HOWEVER if the volume is too light I will just avoid it all together. (About &lt;50k volume)

**CYCC** is a shortsqueeze + a pump. Things like this: (http://finance.yahoo.com/mbview/threadview/?&amp;bn=e3cf49dd-b5d5-3292-b3aa-5f5fce16d65b&amp;tid=1425073917039-66e6288d-02d2-415c-b371-1bd965182d21&amp;tls=la%2Cd%2C0%2C3) really get to the ""greedy"" side of people. Expecting a 2 parabolic right out of the gate. Will be trading the ""back side of the move"". One thing to quickly note is that their are a lot of ""sheeple"" in this stock so if it does begin to washout, it could go a long way.

**UNXL** has always had trouble getting over the 7 mark: (http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=unxl&amp;insttype=&amp;freq=1&amp;show=&amp;time=8). Honestly, it is already so overextended that I do not see it happening. Expecting a 7 ""stuff"" and will risk on 7 for the rest of the day (shorting).

**CLNE** is another stock up on earnings: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/clean-energy-reports-gallons-delivered-and-revenues-rose-30-and-33-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2014-2015-02-26-16159516?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts). It reallllllly is hard to short good earnings ESPECIALLY on a fuel stock. Will be using 6 as a guide to see how the stock price reacts around it. If it bounces off of 6, I will use it as a risk and potentially go long. If it holds under 6 and can't break above it, I will go short risking on that mark. Not shorting parabolic moves.

**SPHS** I am expecting a parabolic to the 1 mark. I will short if it gets ""stuffed"" and risk off 1 for the rest of the day. Will be adding into pops. I will not be shorting slow grinds. 

**ARQL** first red day after a huge runup. Will be shorting if it doesn't parabolic in the morning.

**AVEO** is most likely up on: (http://biz.yahoo.com/e/150227/aveo8-k.html). Not much upside on this stock unfortunately. I will keep it on my watchlist because of it's conference call coming up on Friday. They will be discussing ""The Phase 2 Study"".

15-03-02,"Why did media report Warren Buffett sold off DE position when he didn't?","I'm a little annoyed because I had bought some DE when it briefly traded under 80.  It came out a little later that Buffett had sold his DE position so I stupidly sold mine.  Well, it turns out he not only didn't sell his position but he added.  Can someone explain why this happened?  

I have seen that it is because he got special treatment to hide accumulation.  What is the difference between what happened with DE and IBM?  He just recently added to IBM, but it wasn't reported that he sold out of IBM while he was adding to it.  Doesn't make sense.  

Interestingly now it looks like Warren sold XOM.  But did he really?  Could it be that he is really adding?  It's hard to tell because when he was adding to DE it showed he didn't have any, but when he was adding to IBM it showed he still had his original stake.",2
15-03-02,"Warren Buffett's Advice on Holding Cash, Bonds, and Stocks. (copied from r/personal finance)","From the 2014 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Report:
""Stock prices will always be far more volatile than cash-equivalent holdings. Over the long term, however, currency-denominated instruments are riskier investments – far riskier investments – than widely-diversified stock portfolios that are bought over time and that are owned in a manner invoking only token fees and commissions. That lesson has not customarily been taught in business schools, where volatility is almost universally used as a proxy for risk. Though this pedagogic assumption makes for easy teaching, it is dead wrong: Volatility is far from synonymous with risk. Popular formulas that equate the two terms lead students, investors and CEOs astray.
It is true, of course, that owning equities for a day or a week or a year is far riskier (in both nominal and purchasing-power terms) than leaving funds in cash-equivalents. That is relevant to certain investors – say, investment banks – whose viability can be threatened by declines in asset prices and which might be forced to sell securities during depressed markets. Additionally, any party that might have meaningful near-term needs for funds should keep appropriate sums in Treasuries or insured bank deposits.
For the great majority of investors, however, who can – and should – invest with a multi-decade horizon, quotational declines are unimportant. Their focus should remain fixed on attaining significant gains in purchasing power over their investing lifetime. For them, a diversified equity portfolio, bought over time, will prove far less risky than dollar-based securities.
If the investor, instead, fears price volatility, erroneously viewing it as a measure of risk, he may, ironically, end up doing some very risky things. Recall, if you will, the pundits who six years ago bemoaned falling stock prices and advised investing in “safe” Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit. People who heeded this sermon are now earning a pittance on sums they had previously expected would finance a pleasant retirement. (The S&amp;P 500 was then below 700; now it is about 2,100.) If not for their fear of meaningless price volatility, these investors could have assured themselves of a good income for life by simply buying a very low-cost index fund whose dividends would trend upward over the years and whose principal would grow as well (with many ups and downs, to be sure).
Investors, of course, can, by their own behavior, make stock ownership highly risky. And many do. Active trading, attempts to “time” market movements, inadequate diversification, the payment of high and unnecessary fees to managers and advisors, and the use of borrowed money can destroy the decent returns that a life-long owner of equities would otherwise enjoy. Indeed, borrowed money has no place in the investor’s tool kit: Anything can happen anytime in markets. And no advisor, economist, or TV commentator – and definitely not Charlie nor I – can tell you when chaos will occur. Market forecasters will fill your ear but will never fill your wallet.
The commission of the investment sins listed above is not limited to “the little guy.” Huge institutional investors, viewed as a group, have long underperformed the unsophisticated index-fund investor who simply sits tight for decades. A major reason has been fees: Many institutions pay substantial sums to consultants who, in turn, recommend high-fee managers. And that is a fool’s game.""

**HMNY** is now extremely illiquid. It had a little squeeze into the close on friday (normal for fridays, especially after a big runup). I will be shorting a green to red HOWEVER if the volume is too light I will just avoid it all together. (About &lt;50k volume)

**CYCC** is a shortsqueeze + a pump. Things like this: (http://finance.yahoo.com/mbview/threadview/?&amp;bn=e3cf49dd-b5d5-3292-b3aa-5f5fce16d65b&amp;tid=1425073917039-66e6288d-02d2-415c-b371-1bd965182d21&amp;tls=la%2Cd%2C0%2C3) really get to the ""greedy"" side of people. Expecting a 2 parabolic right out of the gate. Will be trading the ""back side of the move"". One thing to quickly note is that their are a lot of ""sheeple"" in this stock so if it does begin to washout, it could go a long way.

**UNXL** has always had trouble getting over the 7 mark: (http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=unxl&amp;insttype=&amp;freq=1&amp;show=&amp;time=8). Honestly, it is already so overextended that I do not see it happening. Expecting a 7 ""stuff"" and will risk on 7 for the rest of the day (shorting).

**CLNE** is another stock up on earnings: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/clean-energy-reports-gallons-delivered-and-revenues-rose-30-and-33-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2014-2015-02-26-16159516?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts). It reallllllly is hard to short good earnings ESPECIALLY on a fuel stock. Will be using 6 as a guide to see how the stock price reacts around it. If it bounces off of 6, I will use it as a risk and potentially go long. If it holds under 6 and can't break above it, I will go short risking on that mark. Not shorting parabolic moves.

**SPHS** I am expecting a parabolic to the 1 mark. I will short if it gets ""stuffed"" and risk off 1 for the rest of the day. Will be adding into pops. I will not be shorting slow grinds. 

**ARQL** first red day after a huge runup. Will be shorting if it doesn't parabolic in the morning.

**AVEO** is most likely up on: (http://biz.yahoo.com/e/150227/aveo8-k.html). Not much upside on this stock unfortunately. I will keep it on my watchlist because of it's conference call coming up on Friday. They will be discussing ""The Phase 2 Study"".

Turning $9700 into $330000 is an increase of 3302% in just over a year............. I am sorry but I don't believe that, at least I don't believe he started with that much capital (9700).Lets assume it took him 14 months, how could this honestly be possible? This kid would be up approximately **at least** 235% each month....... It just seems impossible. 

To put that into perspective, assuming he was trading with $9000 and just traded with that amount (if he gained capital he would also gain more to invest) it would mean he needs over 7%+ PER DAY. That is such bs, it looks like another tim sykes ploy to sell more of his products.

&gt;Connor Bruggemann is a self-taught trader who, at the age of 16, **turned $9,700 into $330,000+ in a little over a year via trading stocks on his iPhone while in high school (seriously).**

He charges a DVD for $497, which to me tells me it is a marketing ploy to sell more dvd's (selling it to people who want to get rich quick, not because they like trading). 

Also he shows his very suspicious profitly chart in the video. I took a screenshot and pointed out a bunch of suspicious things about it: http://i.imgur.com/qWR6Ddu.png

It would seem that the positives involve the company's sound balance sheet.  With a low P/E P/B, P/C, and P/FCF ratio, along with a dividend percentage, it would appear that the stock would be a great investment. 

On the negatives, however, it would appear that many consider the stock to be fraudulent.  The company has a ridiculous low share price, with a significant short percentage. It would seem that there are also allegations of lack of operations, according to GeoInvesting.

15-03-02,Wall Street Warriors - SanDisk Corporation,"So I am not sure how many people will remember this show but it was back on in 2008 on the MOJO network.  

I recall back in Season 2 they had some stock brokers who told their clients to go all in on SanDisk.  They talked about the advancements of flash memory and how SanDisk was ahead of the curve on this.  Filming took place in the summer of 2007.  

In the short term, they looked like fools as clients were purchasing SNDK for around $50 and the stock tanked.  When the show aired in January 2008, SanDisk was in a tumble and went down to around $6.  

That said, they were actually right about the technology and it appears they were a little early to the party.  SanDisk recovered at topped out at $106 in the summer of 2014 and sits around $79 today.  

As someone new to investing, 7 years seems like a long time to recover but these brokers were right about the stock all along it appears.  It was the technology that played slow.  If their clients had continued to purchase on the way down, because the market did not understand the tech, they would have made a killing.  

If I truly trusted my broker and understood/agreed with the play AND I had the kind of money to invest in $50k to $100k buys...what's so wrong with the long play?  Why were they mocked on public forums?

* Chapters 5 and 6 seem to be a scathing rebuttal to the idea of daytrading or funds being viable in general.  Is there an equally valid counterargument for his data and points that he makes?

* Is inflation a random walk?

* Is the ""Dow Dividend Strategy"" described in the book now obsolete because of the author's previous point about strategies becoming irrelevant due to market immediately adjusting to compensate once the information is public (i.e. EMH)?

* The author says that P/E, P/B and Dividend Yields are higher or lower by a larger margin than anytime in history.  How has this changed in these past 15 years since this edition was published?

* According to the author, money managers don't know what they're doing at all and it's just a dice roll despite their confidence and the showing of public respect for their opinions in the financial news media.  If this were really true, then why do those jobs still exist?  Have people not found a better alternative to active money managers?  Maybe they have and I'm just ignorant or something?

* Is the author still correct that asset price momentum exists at least a little bit?  Even after these 15 years?

* Are TIPS securities still giving a 4.1% real yield like the author says in the book?  Because after reading about the extra fees behind the ""commission rate"" of buying into a fund... where do I sign up..",1

Sure there have been some downturns but I don't plan on cashing out for many years and as such I've weathered those. So while the logic makes sense to me I have a real hard time selling off a portion and moving towards less risk.

15-03-02,"Ya'll need to better understand the myth of 3x ETF decay and holding long term.","Some serious ignorance on 3x ETFS in this subreddit.  You can buy and hold 3x ETFs, there is no such thing as ""decay.""  If 3x's were guaranteed to decay over time, then everyone would short the both the pair and the inverse, or sell put options.  

&amp;nbsp;

The fact is they don't decay over time.  If the base stock is flat over the long term, the expectation value for the 3x is flat too.  The reason you see a lot of losses and supposed ""decay"" is because the *number of possible outcomes resulting in a loss is greater, but the few that result in wins are higher, and cancel out the losses*.  It's the natural mathematical outcome of volatility. 

&amp;nbsp;

Imagine a super simple scenario where you have a stock that either doubles +100% or goes to zero -100% *literally every day*.  This is technically flat in the long term.  What is your expected return on 1$ after 50 days?  Well there's a very small chance of getting it right 50 days in a row which is 1/2^50 =~ 0.000000000000088%, in which case you would have $2^50 ~ $125,900,000,000,000, or a 99.9999999999999912% (I didn't really count the sigfigs honestly) of having 0$.  But, the expectation is 1/2^50 * 2^50 + (1 - 1/2^50) * 0 = 1, which is exactly what you expect for a flat stock.

&amp;nbsp;

3x ETFs are just less extreme examples of the above situation.  If you don't believe me, run a random walk simulation, then multiple each step by 3x for the same walk, and calculate the return over some number of days.  You will find the mean to be the same, but the distribution to be skewed towards more negative returns with a few *much higher returns*.  

&amp;nbsp;

What's the lesson?  3x ETFs can be invested in long term but they are extremely volatile and risky.  They also stop following 3x the underlying return beyond 1 day, which is probably how this whole myth got started.  I did do some simulations for the more popular ETFS, and for a 3x like JDST, you probably have a ~70% likelihood of a negative return after a month of holding, with some slightly nonzero chance of major &gt;100% returns, if you're a betting man....",0
15-03-02,Market implications for curing cancer,"Did anyone else see the [VICE episode on HBO about a new way to kill cancer with oncolytic virotherapy?](http://youtu.be/e8SvBAjXGyQ). Sounds like how [I am legend got started](http://youtu.be/B3xY6Ffy_wE).

Doctors in the show said that within our lifetime, these drugs will be widely used effectively, but also that in the near term (2016!) there could be expedited FDA approvals.

Anyway, it seems it's only private companies doing this research and eventual marketing of these drugs, but do we foresee any market shifts that would become profitable or unprofitable as a result of the elusive cure for cancer? 

ie, do we think traditional oncology treatments from public companies would be less profitable in the future?

15-03-02,"In the next 75-100 years, will a method be developed to accurately predict future market conditions?","As I read more and more articles, books, and essays on finance, economics, statistics, etc., it feels like the only certainty is uncertainty. 


My understanding is this: There's no way to outperform the market over time. Some mutual fund managers may do it every few years, but from the data I've seen, not very often/consistently. Maybe the individual investor could strike gold with blind luck and buy AAPL at $20, but that's not the norm.


I feel like it would be instant nobel-prize material if a reliable model were developed to predict the market. It seems like very distinguished academics can develop models that support entirely different conclusions. Is predicting the market the financial industry's ""cure for cancer"" or is it inherently impossible to develop a model to accurately predict the market? 

Edit: good replies, everyone, I think that about answers the question :)",0
15-03-02,Merrill Edge incorrect dates on 1099s,"I started a thread on this a month ago:
http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2u2w3h/merrilledge_incorrect_trade_date/

I think their response (promising to correct the individual mistake that I pointed out, rather than making a system wide correction to every place they know they made the same mistake) is so bizarre, I decided to repeat this thread.

Many of their dates in my 1099 are incorrect.  I'm not certain, but I think it might be all the transactions that they performed internally as market maker (rather than sending to an exchange).  
  
Only one of their incorrect dates hurt me in an obvious way for 2014 (changing a short term loss to long term).  But I need to review carefully to see if any of their other incorrect dates will cause wash sale complications.  This was the only short term loss I cut that close to the boundary in 2014.  But I have cut wash sale avoidance that close several times and then did not highlight those in any way in my records.  I highlight open situations where I need to be careful of wash sale.  I highlight actual wash sales, which I had none of in 2014.  But once the wash sale date passes, I delete the indicator that I ever worried about it.  (With cross account wash sale issues, if an incorrect date creates a wash sale, ML wouldn't report it as such because of the account boundary, but the IRS would likely spot it and penalize me after it is too late to get ML to correct their original error).

15-03-02,I need to sell a stock at a loss. How does claiming a capital loss on my taxes work? How much can I actually recover?,"A little background: I had saved up a good emergency fund and decided to start trading a bit last year. 

Not long after I was laid off and my emergency fund drained significantly. Luckily, I was able to sell about 80% of my portfolio for a profit. However, there was one IPO that I took a risk on (I know, I shouldn't have) and it really hasn't paid off yet. I've had it fora  year and it's down about -$800. 

Now, I was originally was in this long term and being -$800 wasn't a big deal to me. But I recently decided to buy a house and I may need to sell this stock. I guess it sounds dumb, but I never put much thought into selling at a loss because I didn't think I'd have to take such a hit (I make about $60k, so $800 is kind of a lot to me to lose.) How does claiming a capital loss on my taxes work? How much can I actually recover?

What really bothers me about selling is that I pretty much just need it to show my mortgage lender that I have 3 months reserve payments. I only need $3k of what I invested and if I sold today it's worth about $5k. I'd rather not sell because this money will just sit in my bank account, unused. I have closing costs, down payment, appraisal fee, etc.  I'm hoping they'll let me use my investments accounts and the reserve payments don't HAVE to be in liquid accounts, but I think they usually just let borrowers use their 401ks.

TL;DR I need to sell a stock at an -$800 loss to show my mortgage lender I have 3 months worth of payments on reserve. I want to know how much I'll be able to recover.

15-03-02,A bit of clarification on the returns of leveraged funds along with a simulation inside.,"A while back there was a discussion about the returns of 3x funds and why they tend to not match market performance.

The consensus was that while there are multiple reasons (fees), the primary reason is due to the term ""Beta Slippage"". There is a great article [here](http://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/nn/articles/Leveraged-and-Inverse-ETFs-Not-Right-for-Everyone) on what this is by Schwab.

Essentially though, the reason is due to the following arithmetic based on the premise that there is an underlying asset and a leveraged fund that has a multiple of 3x.
 
Here's 5 days of returns: 

Asset: `5%, -3%, -2%, 3%, 2%, -5%` = 0.996

Leveraged: `15%, -9%, -6%, 9%, 6%, -15%` = 0.9660

Notice how both of those sets of 5-Day returns have an arithmetically calculated mean of 0%, yet the Asset has a total return of `-0.034%` and the leveraged fund has a total return of `-3.340%`.

This is due to the simple concept that 1.01 * 0.99 doesn't actually equal 1. It is slightly less. It means also that anything with a normal distribution that is multiplied continuously will always drift toward zero.

Now though, this time I have a simulation to help people understand just how terrible these leveraged ETFs can be **in the long term**.

Here's the simulation basics:

1. Asset has a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 1%/day. For reference, \^GSPC is nearly normal (more kurtosis and slight positive skewness), and has a standard deviation of 1.07%/day. The drift is zero, and you can pick the leverage of the second fund.

[Here's a link on JS Fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/brockwhittaker/yuk7ajfn/). This one isn't on my site, so if you really don't want to visit my site then you don't have to.

[Here's the full-page simulation](http://lavancier.com/brockCharts/SimulateLeverage.php).

Into the first bar enter the leverage, so to simulate the difference between a normal asset and a 3x leverage, just input ""3"". 

Into the second bar input the actual term length in days. Keep in mind that there are about 251 days in a market year, so five years is roughly 1250 days.

To actually run the simulation, click anywhere on the background and a chart should appear. Every time you click it'll run with the specified parameter. There's no need to click a submit button or change the parameter before clicking again.

If you are using an older computer, keep the number of days to less than 150,000 -- otherwise it'll either take a while or it'll freeze the tab.

In the box below there are a few information pieces -- 

1. The asset return.

2. The leveraged fund return.

3. The number of times the asset beat the leveraged fund.

4. The number of times the leveraged fund beat the asset.

Test a bunch of parameters and see what you get!

[Here's an example after 100 simulations](http://i.imgur.com/mlqGfPC.png).

Hope this clears up the reason for why 3x leveraged funds aren't a good idea over the long term!

**CYCC** is actually extremely difficult to gauge. It is a pump and squeeze stock
( is a shortsqueeze + a pump. Things like this: (http://finance.yahoo.com/mbview/threadview/?&amp;bn=e3cf49dd-b5d5-3292-b3aa-5f5fce16d65b&amp;tid=1425073917039-66e6288d-02d2-415c-b371-1bd965182d21&amp;tls=la%2Cd%2C0%2C3[1] ) . If in the morning the stock can't break over .70, I will short risking off that mark. Based on how it acted intraday today, I do not think it will happen. If it does parabolic to 2, I will use it as a guide to short ideally risking off that mark.

**NYMX** is up on no news whatsoever, most likely a news letter play/message board play. If it is the case then it will most likely play out like CYCC. Ideally it will parabolic to 1 and will use it as a guide for my trade for the rest of the day. If it fails to break it then I will go short risking off it, if breaks and holds above 1 I will wait for a parabolic move to short.  If the stock begins to drop in the morning it could go a long way (because ""sheeple"" are buying this stock, hoping for 500% returns).

**ONCY** is up on (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oncolytics-biotech-inc-announces-receipt-of-orphan-drug-designation-from-the-us-fda-for-cancer-of-the-fallopian-tube-2015-03-02?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts), whether true or not, it is hype. People buying this are hoping it's the next big thing. Expecting a parabolic to 1.30 and will short risking off that thoughout the day. Under an extreme oddball situation where this stock spikes all the way to 2, I will just wait for a parabolic move to short.

**DRAM** is another pump and dump (thank god there are more of these). With only 2.15 million float, this stock has the ability to really squeeze shorts and head a lot higher. It could be the next SGNL. Expecting a parabolic to 3.5 and will use that a guide thoughout the day, OR it will washout below 3 and will use 3 as a guide to short thoughout the day. Shorting pops and parabolic moves.

**JOB** is a dead ""cat"" bounce. (http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=job&amp;insttype=&amp;freq=1&amp;show=&amp;time=8) In reality it could keep going, but I don't think it will. Expecting a 1.25 ""stuff"" and will risk short pops all the way down.

15-03-02,"I'm out (for now)!","Bought stocks for the first time on the 1st week of January, I took $5000 and I invested in the following companies:

Activision - 10 stocks of ATVI @ ~$20

Apple - 10 stocks of AAPL @ ~$100

Amazon - 5 stocks of AMZN @ ~$280

Tesla - 10 stocks of TSLA @ ~$20

Twitter - 25 stocks of TWTR @ ~$40

Since then, I've been adding more money occasionally here and there and today I've realized I've already poured in over $20,000 (~$19,400) into my trading account across 20+ different stocks and I realized I should control myself before anything loss occurs. I've realized gains on about 1/2 of my stocks (including every stock I initially invested in) and I've realized losses over the other ones. I'm only breaking even on two company stocks, which are American Express and Tesla. The 1st week of March is here and I'm kinda getting paranoid about dropping prices, so I've decided to pull out. 

Amazon brought me the greatest return, ~31% gain since my stock buy on January 5th. The worst was Tesla bringing a ~2% net loss. Not bad for a 2-month long investment I think! The only thing I regret is not buying into Netflix (NFLX) at the beggining, which jumped up reeeeeally high only a couple days after my first investments, but oh well you really can't time things like that. Overall I feel I got really lucky with my first trading experience.

15-03-02,Question about valuations of solar companies.,"Hey r/investing!
So I am interested in the solar energy market for many reasons which you can easily find throughout the internet. I am interested in picking individual stocks (no hate please), but I have no knowledge of any solar company (apart from vague knowledge due to Elon Musk investing in SolarCity).
Therefore, I looked at two solar ETF's, found 6 of their largest holdings each, and wanted to find the biggest companies. This is because, in a emerging industry, I would like only the largest companies. 
Here they are, ranked by their weighting in the ETF's: 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XfbhRl9XYBIgPxbqtpNMo802W5MQ76BPgSZVtj13D-E/edit?usp=sharing

I know many of you here are interested in solar, so I am sure this would help you guys. My question is, why is Hanergy so over valued? Is solar city so overvalued because of Mr. Musk? I would love some brief explanations of why some companies are so overvalued compared to others. 

Thanks so much! And I hope this little chart is helpful!",5

15-03-02,I put pen to paper to figure out: what happens when you hold onto a 3x Leveraged ETF for more than a day?,"I've been reading quite a few discussions on reddit over the weekend and then today about holding 3x Leveraged ETFs for more than a day, which is warned against by, for example, this [SEC publication](http://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/leveragedetfs-alert.htm) which responds to the question ""What happens if I hold longer than one trading day?"" by saying:

&gt;While there may be trading and hedging strategies that justify holding these investments longer than a day, buy-and-hold investors with an intermediate or long-term time horizon should carefully consider whether these ETFs are appropriate for their portfolio. As discussed above, because leveraged and inverse ETFs reset each day, their performance can quickly diverge from the performance of the underlying index or benchmark. In other words, it is possible that you could suffer significant losses even if the long-term performance of the index showed a gain.

Furthermore, *some* ETFs can be victims of something called [deterioration risk](https://secure.marketwatch.com/story/the-myth-behind-leveraged-etfs-2012-11-29).

But I was curious: Suppose we found an ETF that is not a target for deterioration risk: **what happens when you buy and hold a 3x leveraged ETF that (more or less) meets its targets?**

To answer this question, let's recall what the definition of a 3x leveraged ETF is: it is an ETF that uses leverage in order to move its price (technically, the value of its portfolio) each day with 3x the percentage change of some underlying security. So for example, if West Texas Intermediate crude oil increases 1% in a day, then UWTI, a 3x leveraged ETF, seeks to increase by 3% that day. 

Now, with the definition for the 3x leveraged ETF in hand, one can set up two portfolios, putting P dollars into the underlying asset and P dollars into the leveraged asset to see what happens. Let's call U_t the value of the investment in the underlying on day t, and let's call L_t the value of investing in the leveraged ETF on day t. Then let's call R_i the percentage increase in the underlying asset on the i^th day (a percentage decrease is represented by a ""negative increase""). So if the underlying goes up 1% on day 3, then R_3 = 1% = 0.01 .

Then what is the value of these two portfolios on day t?

    U_t = P {Product over i from 1 to t of} (1 + R_i)

    L_t = P {Product over i from 1 to t of} (1 + 3R_i)

So I was curious, I had heard of several types of ""decay"" that people talked about, so I was wondering just what happens when you divide L_t by U_t? Is it more than one? Less than one? Let's check:

    L_t         P {Product over i from 1 to t of} (1 + 3R_i)
    ---    =  --------------------------------------------------  
    U_t        P {Product over i from 1 to t of} (1 + R_i)


                                              (1 + 3R_i)
           =  {Product over i from 1 to t of}--------------
                                              (1 + R_i) 

Now for each i, note that because R_i is small we can make the following approximation (I give a hint why in practice the error of ""approximating"" is negligible [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2xpcqe/i_put_pen_to_paper_to_figure_out_what_happens/cp2a1qu)):

    (1 + 3R_i)               R_i               
    ----------    =   1 + 2-------   ~= 1 + 2R_i
    (1 + R_i)                1+R_i

So 

    L_t        
    ---    ~=   {Product over i from 1 to t of} (1 + 2R_i)
    U_t   

Furthermore, because each R_i is quite small, R_i * R_j is very small, so in the above product we can approximate by setting each term with a product R_i * R_j = 0. This approximation gives us the final answer:

    L_t    
    ---    ~=    1 + 2*({Sum over i from 1 to t of}R_i)
    U_t   

Edit: I'm back. One thing I wanted to point out from this formula is that you can see by the formula here that if your average daily return of the underlying asset is positive, then the leveraged ETF actually does give you improved performance over investing in the underlying asset itself, including over periods of time longer than a day.",28
15-03-02,Invest in TVIX @ $2. Hear me out...,"Market at all time highs. Means all is well right? Nope...we are in a ridiculous bubble and can't wait to see the correction. VIX is still trading at $13 but once it gets to $12, we should see TVIX back to $3 levels in the coming weeks. 

Yellen speaks tomorrow and she's essentially the one that has been propping up this bull market. My best guess is rates should start to be cut mid year. Still a good play on TVIX though. I'm starting 25% position here at $2.

15-03-02,Crude Oil Sentiment for this week,"As expected I saw bullish movement this morning with weekend fundamentals and EUR weakness driving down Brent and creating a more reasonable (but still high BRENT WTI spread) . However this won't last. In my opinion. I exited my ""house money"" position on UWTI at 3.04. Not the best, but pigs do get slaughtered. DYDD.




Going forward oil will be volatile for the following reasons:

EURUSD pair volatility --&gt;&gt; Pending QE, PMI, inflation reports.

USD strength in question. --&gt; I see USD strength declining. It is unreasonable at the moment and this is reflected in BRENT / WTI spreads.

Rivers which deliver pump grade products near key refineries will be navigable as temperatures rise. There are currently frozen log jams. This is why the price at the pump isn't tracking price of crude.

Following up with the point just mentioned. I see maintenance putting upward pressure on crude going into wednesday and thursday. This should not last.

USW strike talks should also not have an effect. But amateur traders will discount WTI further if talks are successful. In reality, the workers are already replaced by contract workers in substitution.

Looking for others' views. Discuss.

2012 revenue was $57 million.  2013 revenue was $82.5 million. 2012 earnings were $4.133 million and 2013 earnings were $5.423 million. [Pic](http://imgur.com/Cib5BY2)  As of the end of September, SHAK had total assets of $65.5 million and $29.7 million in liabilities.  There are currently 35.5 million common shares outstanding.  At today's close, that places a market cap of over $1.6 Billion.  That means it trades at a trailing PE of roughly 300 and around 19.5 times sales.  For reference, CMG only ever traded at a high of around 6 time sales back in early 2012, and it currently trades at a price to sales of around 5.

I understand that SHAK is still a young company that is growing fast, but even when growth is taken into consideration, SHAK trades at a very large PEG multiple of 22.42 [source](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/shak/analyst-research), which is much higher than CMG's 1.85.

15-03-03,Investing for Beginners Part 2 – Different Investment Strategies,"Part 1 of this Investing for Beginners series is officially over – we’ve covered all the basic terminology. In Part 2 of this series, we’re going to be looking at the different investment strategies (and how each strategy works). Here’s a quick breakdown.

Buy and hold (the right way to do it – not the conventional way)
Secular investing (what some people might call “fundamental investing”)
Trend following
Contrarian investing
Discretionary investing (what some people might call “trading”. This term is actually a misnomer. I’ll explain why in later posts).
Short term trading.
As you can see, there is a pattern in this breakdown. The strategies go from longer term (eg. 20 year investment cycles) to shorter term (eg 5 months investment cycles). I’ll explain each of these six strategies in detail. However, in this post I’m going to explain exactly what investment strategy is right for you. But before I do that, let me tell you a little story.

There was once a guy called John Smith, born circa 1975. By the late 1990s, John had just graduated, had a serious girlfriend, got a job, wanted to settle down, and needed some extra cash (hey – no one ever said that relationships came cheap). What year was this? 1998, the top of the hot-dot-com (internet bubble)! He starts off as a day trader, because “he wants to make some extra money on the side”. The tech bubble bursts in 2000, and John says “I don’t want to be a day trader any more. I want to be a long term investor”. 2008 comes along, and John gets his head handed to him again in the financial markets. Seeing his horrific losses, John says to himself “I’ll be a buy and hold investor, just like Warren Buffett. I’ll hold onto my investments forever”.

I find this story to be very amusing, because it describes the exact story about how most investors chose their investment strategies – their external circumstances (aka market conditions) make them choose their strategy. Please don’t do that.

Your Personality
First and foremost – your personality is what determines your investment strategy. This is a pretty simple concept actually. There are 2 key aspects of your personality that are important here:

Your speed.
Your stomache.
Some people are slow. I don’t mean that to offend anyone – they just are (I remember my Gr. 3 teacher asking one of my peers “Gabriel, do you have any gear other than Slow?”). In fact, being slow isn’t a disadvantage when it comes to investing (slow is synonymous with patient). There are two types of people: fast people and slow people. Fast people need thrill and excitement in their life. They just can’t sit on their butts and watch money slowly come in. They have to feel as if they’re doing something all the time. For these people, buy and hold definitely will not work. Trading is suitable to them – if you can’t even hold onto an investment for a year, how are you supposed to “buy and hold it” for 20 years? Impossible!

Some people are risk-takers, while others like to avoid risk. Personally, I admire a life like Steve Jobs’ – a roller coaster. I can’t stand low volatility in the markets. I need a heavily volatile market to remain comfortable. Your ability to take risk and withstand volatility (how much the market fluctuates) will determine what investment strategy is right for you.

Your Time
I get it – life is busy, maybe you’ve got the young family, 2 kids, a-hole of a boss. Your time will impact your investment strategy. That’s a no-brainer. The less time you have, the longer term of an investment strategy you’ll need to take.

But here’s what I want you to remember. Below a certain level of commitment (eg 2 hours a week), you shouldn’t be investing. Investing – like any other occupation, career, part time job, etc – is all about commitment. If you can’t even commit an hour each week to learning about investing and keeping abreast of the financial markets, you shouldn’t be investing! Stick your money into a bond or a bank or something!

The financial markets are a zero sum game. For every dollar made there’s a dollar lost. If you’re the house league guy playing against a triple A hockey player, can you win? Of course not! If you don’t even have a decent amount of commitment to investing, all you’re doing is giving money to guys like Warren Buffett who will make money!

Your Money
Last but not least, the amount of money you have will influence what type of investment strategy you should pursue. If you just have $20,000 I’m sorry to break it to you. Buy and hold just won’t work. A person with $1 million only needs to make 10% a year to make $100k, while a person with $100k will need to make 100% a year to make $100k.

This being said, it’s pretty obvious what I’m hinting at – the less money you have (“startup” capital), the more actively you’ll need to invest and pursue superior investment returns.

After February's strong 5.5% performance, this market must let off some more steam than was already let off in Wed, Thurs, Fri of last week, right? I am looking for suggestions on how to move forward in this trade. 

I would be happiest if I made at least $100 on this trade, but not losing is good too. The current breakeven price is around 209.60

Should I double down on another large up day like today? Should I purchase some longer duration ITM calls , say September? Should I cut the trade for +$450 loss? Should roll the puts forward to June or September? 

Does anyone have access to a fancy probability calculator or formula? What is the probability of the SPY touching the 208.50 before May 15?

**CYCC** is actually extremely difficult to gauge. It is a pump and squeeze stock
( is a shortsqueeze + a pump. Things like this: (http://finance.yahoo.com/mbview/threadview/?&amp;bn=e3cf49dd-b5d5-3292-b3aa-5f5fce16d65b&amp;tid=1425073917039-66e6288d-02d2-415c-b371-1bd965182d21&amp;tls=la%2Cd%2C0%2C3[1] ) . If in the morning the stock can't break over .70, I will short risking off that mark. Based on how it acted intraday today, I do not think it will happen. If it does parabolic to 2, I will use it as a guide to short ideally risking off that mark.

**NYMX** is up on no news whatsoever, most likely a news letter play/message board play. If it is the case then it will most likely play out like CYCC. Ideally it will parabolic to 1 and will use it as a guide for my trade for the rest of the day. If it fails to break it then I will go short risking off it, if breaks and holds above 1 I will wait for a parabolic move to short.  If the stock begins to drop in the morning it could go a long way (because ""sheeple"" are buying this stock, hoping for 500% returns).

**ONCY** is up on (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/oncolytics-biotech-inc-announces-receipt-of-orphan-drug-designation-from-the-us-fda-for-cancer-of-the-fallopian-tube-2015-03-02?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts), whether true or not, it is hype. People buying this are hoping it's the next big thing. Expecting a parabolic to 1.30 and will short risking off that thoughout the day. Under an extreme oddball situation where this stock spikes all the way to 2, I will just wait for a parabolic move to short.

**DRAM** is another pump and dump (thank god there are more of these). With only 2.15 million float, this stock has the ability to really squeeze shorts and head a lot higher. It could be the next SGNL. Expecting a parabolic to 3.5 and will use that a guide thoughout the day, OR it will washout below 3 and will use 3 as a guide to short thoughout the day. Shorting pops and parabolic moves.

**JOB** is a dead ""cat"" bounce. (http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=job&amp;insttype=&amp;freq=1&amp;show=&amp;time=8) In reality it could keep going, but I don't think it will. Expecting a 1.25 ""stuff"" and will risk short pops all the way down.

15-03-03,Drop Shipping,"So I've always been curious about starting a drop shipping business. I mean no inventory, and you paying for the wholesale item not until it's purchased sounds great and risk free, but the whole nexus law that differs from state to state has made the idea more cringing and frustrating than I chose to put the effort toward learning in. Say I start up an eBay store. Okay, so obviously if I live in Michigan and sell to someone in Michigan, I must charge the customer tax, and if they live elsewhere I do not. However if I use a third party  company (let's say Amazon) to ship the item for me to a customer in another state and Amazon has a distribution center in that state, that could give me nexus depending on the state and I would have to charge the customer the appropriate tax. Some states say it's the drop shippers responsibility, where as some say it's the retailers, and some consider the relAtionship between the two not nexus related. Can anyone shed some insight on this? My accountant said to not charge my customers tax and just pay tax on what the wholesale item costs, but that kind of sounds like an audit risk to me with how money hungry and broke the states are. Am I going to need to apply for a sales tax license in 48 different states or is this just a hassle that's not worth it. And if to add icing on the cake, most states are destination sales tax states, which means to calculate tax appropriately would be a full time job in itself.

I was wondering if it would be better to invest with margin instead of buying a leveraged ETF. I know the two aren't completely the same.


With a leveraged ETF the daily return of your invested gets multiplied whereas with margin you are multiplying the capital that you are investing with barrowed money which also multiplies the return of your investment.

The market in gearing up to a new week and a new month, after an exciting end to last week’s trading.
After days of relative quietness, the Dollar made a big move on Thursday, with the USD index gaining over 1% through the last 2 trading days of the week. The EUR/USD erased large gains, dropping to monthly lows around 1.119, following a near 200 pips drop on Thursday. USD/JPY also climbed strongly, rallying about 100 pips up to 119.6.
February was Wall-Street’s best month since 2011, with the S&amp;P gaining 5.5%. The market’s steady rise with low volatility, combined with a sharp decent of the VIX “fear” index, dropping around 25% during the month, reflects the market’s over-all content with the ECB growth stimulating measures In Europe, alongside relative calmness in OIL prices.

To meet my future goals, I'm considering renting the entire property to establish the rental history. In my market, I expect a potential $1700/mo conservatively. The monthly mortgage/tax/insurance is $1357. I anticipate $3000/yr maintenance and upkeep (likely less, but I'd like to play it safe).

2. Should I start reporting the rental income I currently earn? (i.e. would this help me with a future rental purchase?)

3. Am I missing anything?

15-03-03,Case study on risk management: The Saxo Bank crisis 2015,"http://www.garp.org/risk-news-and-re...?newsId=129462


Fellow GARPs, this Saxo Bank crisis should be well documented as a case study.

From risk management prospective, Saxo Bank committed a big mistake.

1. In its FX business, Saxo Bank makes prices to clients on FX spot, forward and options. That means Saxo Bank is having a principal-to-principal relationship with clients. On their trading platform, the prices are all tradable, and it forms an ""offer"". Once the trade is executed on the trading platform, via clients' action, or orders triggered, that constitutes an ""acceptance"". With ""offer"" and ""acceptance"", that is a contract sealed. For whatever reason that one side manipulate the details of the transaction (here it is price), it is a breach of contract. The new price of the contract has no legal power to be enforced because the content is not mutually agreed.

2. In its letter explaining the methodology of the “re-pricing”, Saxo Bank is confusing itself as an agent. In this business, Saxo Bank is actually the sole market maker from clients’ perspective. There are no other markets. If Saxo Bank explains its methodology with reference to EBS, the client agreements have to be re-written that Saxo Bannk acts as an agent and all trade flows (spot and forward) goes to EBS (and Saxo Bank bears no responsibility on the fills), and each and every trade confirmation with EBS has to be sent to clients. However, it still cannot solve Saxo Bank’s problems in options because it cannot find a sizable marketplace for options similar to EBS.

3. The key problem of Saxo Bank is its risk control on pricing. As a market maker, Saxo Bank has full discretion to quote a price on its trading platform. The bid price it quote to clients is the price Saxo Bank willing to buy from clients, and the ask price it quote to clients is the price Saxo Bank willing to sell to clients. Therefore, always, Saxo Bank should display a price that it is willing to do buy and sell (for this part the Trading department takes the blame, then the Risk Management department). It cannot first quote clients a price and then twelve hours later tell clients that, sorry, we are going to change your transacted price to another price blah blah blah.

4. Another highlight of the incidence, from a risk management perspective, is how Saxo Bank manages its FX exposure. If clients are selling CHF, to avoid depreciation of the CHF, Saxo Bank should have shorted a certain amount of CHF with its own trading counterparties. Did Saxo Bank get out of its hedge positions before it cut clients’ margin positions? Would it be possible that Saxo Bank got hit by betting bigger than clients and then transferred the losses to clients by manipulating clients’ positions? ",7

15-03-03,Discussion About Formation Metals (FMETF) - Cobalt Mining and Battery Speculation,"I haven't been in stocks much and thought a way to start out would be investing in battery technology companies. One of the major components in battery manufacturing is the metal cobalt.

Currently Formation Metals appears to be the only company able to capitalize on mining cobalt in US. They are developing a mine and refinery in Idaho. Once operational it will be the only domestic source of cobalt. They are working on the Idaho Cobalt Project (http://www.formationmetals.com/s/Operations.asp).

You most likely have heard of Tesla's new battery factory opening in a couple of years. Elon Musk has stated he would prefer to source materials inside the US rather than abroad. A certain fruit company is also very interested in battery technologies going so far as to poaching employees with huge bonuses.

The value of cobalt is at historic lows. Currently around $15 per pound and peaked at about $50 per pound in 2008 (http://www.infomine.com/investment/metal-prices/cobalt/10-year/).

According to this article (http://www.wallstreetdaily.com/2015/01/13/cobalt-electric-car-battery/) demand caused by batteries will exceed the supply of cobalt in the next 2 years.

As for Formation Metals the company peaked in 2011 with a stock price of $2.25. The stock is currently $0.012 and has been going up since a low of $0.07. It is an extremely low volume stock and it took me several days to finally buy in.

Because I like to incite discussion, is this a long term play at all? ""Overall for the December quarter, the company reported a loss of $58 million, or 73 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $8.9 million, or 22 cents a share.""

I like the company and I like their goal of european expansion, which I think is doable. Yes their concept can be easily copied and amazon does offer home-goods, but at the same time they only have 5 key brands which led to #347 million in sales, which leads me to believe that there is room to grow.

Just made my first stock purchase in my newly opened brokerage account. I'm very new to this, but have always wanted to get my feet wet. Was wondering if I could get some feedback, any form of feedback would be appreciated.

I recently invested into my IRA, by purchasing some Vanguard funds which really got me going. So today I went ahead and deposited $1900 into my new brokerage account. I wanted to go with 3 companies, a safe company and I choose two that I'm hoping will make me some money in the next 6 months to a year.

I've been using the ""Prudent Speculator"", they release a report every month of 40-50 under valued stocks. I've been watching the under valued stocks they pick and it seems they do a great job. I decided to select 2 off of the new report that came out today for March.

INTC (Intel)
UVV (Universal Corporation)

I decided to put 40% of the $1900 into DIS, I then split the remaining 60% of the $1900 evenly into INTC and UVV.

In summary:
DIS: 7 shares at $105.32
UVV: 12 shares at $47.56
INTC: 17 shares at $33.89

Was this a bad way to start, should I have invested the entire $1900 into ""safe"" stocks rather than ""under-valued""? I wanted to gamble a bit with the money, so that is my reasoning for going with 60% in undervalued stocks. I'm young, and if I woke up to all 3 of these companies at $0, it wouldn't be the end all.


Also, say you had $1900 and a completely empty brokerage account at age 25. What would you have gone with if you were looking to gamble a bit?

biomimic - if you built this are you willing to discuss the underlying technology and business model a bit?
I am curious about your corpus source for making the connections; company filings, company websites, financial news, other - all of the above?
Are you also clustering topics rather than just doing keyword level connections?
If it is not a trade secret can you discuss what text mining approaches you take with this service?
How do you see investors using this?
What is your business model?

2 points by biomimic 1 day ago

Yes, I can discuss the underlying technology. Much of it is based on building large vectors similar to word2vec but much more exhaustive in terms of rich, scored and ranked vectors. Comparing vectors for similarity is almost as important as how one constructs the vectors in vector space. Mimicking the way a human might manually construct a vector remains key.
Relying on vector similarity as opposed to direct keyword matches is an approach that's taken. Utilizing statistical and probabilistic approaches as opposed to ""words and rules"" remains important.
See: http://cymetica.com/cymetica_about.html
and the following: http://genopharmix.com/biomimetic-cognition/in_silico_cognit...
The corpus is currently just limited Reuters public company profiles &amp; descriptions but I plan to include SEC filings as well.
Traders, investors, hedge funds can engage is quick information arbitrage with it. For example, a stock runs up 20% in minute, you insert a keyword or the symbol related to the stock that ran up, you then get other stocks (a targeted basket) that have sympathetic, symbiotic and parasitic relationships before any research analyst can uncover the connections - rising tide lifts all boats or a lowering tide lowers them. Ref: ""Contagious Speculation and a Cure for Cancer: A Non-Event that Made Stock Prices Soar"" -http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/whoswho/getpub.cfm?pub=1555
The system can include tiered consumer/trader/investor subscriptions, licensing and net profit sharing with selected hedge funds. SeekingAlpha, StockTwits, Yahoo Finance etc as revenue partners. We're raising a bit of funding in the meantime while we also use it as a trading tool ourselves.
It's a prototype that's being moved into production this week or next.

Extremely nice implementation and very good explanation of its use case. What would be interesting in the future once you're at the marketing stage would be to run through an example using historical data to provide me with an indication of my returns.

1 point by biomimic 3 hours ago

Thanks and I agree that historical performance metrics would be a great indication of returns.
What I'd like to do would be to create a system that processes 5 years worth of historical data, gathers all symbols that have had spikes up or down by 10-75%, have good volume and liquidity and are affected by either news or an earnings report. I could then auto-construct the baskets that surround each issue and calculate returns on the long side or short side.
I like this system because it executes on 4 critical levels:
1. Works in a good market or in a bad market due to short and long positioning that can be taken whereas most trading systems (and Technical Analysis) only really work in good markets.
2. You don't have to be late in terms of buying into (or shorting) the direct issue. You buy into or short the indirect issues, which enable protection and diversification.
3. Nobody really is doing this today.
4. It's based on information arbitrage and hidden connections, not numbers.

15-03-04,$5k into $Dis The Walt Disney Company for the long haul,"After a month of research I finally pulled the trigger on The Walt Disney Company ($DIS) and grabbed 40 shares (10 at 105 and 30 at 105.8). This is the only stock I was sure on. Apple is too overvalued in my eyes and its new ventures I see as failures (long list of about 20 rejects i denied to decide on Disney). Here is why I feel comfortable with this buy (not going to go super deep into specific numbers or %):

*Going for a long term investment. No set window to get out, dont need the money. I figure a crash will happen before i decide to sell, in which case ill put another 10-40k into it and wait for the market to come back up.

A) Parks are doing great. Ticket prices went up, yes, but this isnt the biggest deal to me. Asia is going to be a great market, Shanghai coming soon, expansion at other parks. This simply isnt a facet of the company that I see dropping off, sure a recession would hurt, but ill explain my recession thoughts at the end of my write up.

B) Movies and merchandise are going to be very strong for the next couple of years. Almost every single big movie that I can think of has been owned by Disney lately. Star wars is coming out, Transformers, they own Marvel and we dont even need to talk about all of the Disney pictures (Frozen, pixar films, princess type shit). I see them owning a lot of top grossing movies over the next decade. This brings in a lot of merchandising opportunities, ones that Disney has been great at milking.

C) Their media presence is huge. Owning A+E, ABC networks, ESPN, Hulu, Disney networks. They have so many avenues to advertise through these networks, it is also their highest earning facet of the company. Sure hulu might fail, I see netflix being the only noteworthy subscription based streaming service, but they own a lot of mainstay networks that would find hard to fail.

I see Disney as a little to big to fail right now. They have maintained massive growth over the years, through a lot of hard times and have still rebounded. Their parks have manages to stay fresh and they continue to put out quality entertainment. Sure the market is at the highest ever, but im young, I didnt have the money to get on them any earlier than at this point. If a recession hits, if the markets drop, whatever it is, ill double up and wait for it to ride right back up. 

I know a lot of people see Disney as a somewhat low risk stock, and im sure im missing a bunch, but thats my view on it all.

Thoughts? Im new to this, pick me apart.

15-03-04,Stop-limits vs. buying puts. Thoughts?,"Looking for thoughts on the following:

In Jan. I bought 200 shares of USO at 17.60. I've been selling covered calls on them and have made a 7% profit on the investment so far. But these returns in 2 months seem to beat the market quite a bit, so I think I must be profiting so well because the investment is riskier than I originally thought that it would be. (I was expecting a slow climb upward over the year, but not drastic moves, so my plan was to hold the shares and sell 3-6 week-out OTM covered calls on them.) I don't want to unwind everything now, but I do want to protect my downside, so I put in a limit order for 2 22-month-out 17.00 puts (I want them so far out so I can sell them later should I decide to unwind my position). 

I'm just wondering how this plan compares with using a stop-limit order instead? Even though a stop-limit order doesn't cost a premium nor tie-up money, it's also risky in that if something opens way below what it closed at the day before, your limit order might not take. Just wondering what thoughts you all have on this plan and using stop-limit orders vs puts to protect from downside in general?",3

And other general advice.,"I've kind of got the hang of this, not putting any money in right now but I find myself spending time looking at charts and trying to find specific patterns. I just want the fundamental, basic criteria needed to find potential plays. I want to scope through as many relevant charts as possible, find the most sexy, then watch those for volatility and time my entrance/exit. 


I'm trying to avoid criteria based on daily movements, instead using 20-50 day averages. Scoping out the 'calms before the storm', or whale watching, if you will. Set a volume alarm on any stocks that look like a potential play, once that lights up you watch and trade it daily. Would that work, or am I missing something important? 


http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=211&amp;f=sh_price_u7,ta_sma50_pa&amp;ft=4

So far the only criteria I use is anything below $7 and any increase in simple moving average. Not really sure what measurements to use as far as volume goes. I'm worried that setting criteria up that watch any increase/decrease would block potential plays.. maybe the best thing to do is just spend one day a month looking at every freakin chart.


""No overnights"" is a rule not to be broken, right? I can see why, but on some of these stocks ([GENE](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=GENE+Interactive) for example) it seems practical to hold if things look good. Do the indicators in this stock (volume spike followed by stairstep pattern)warrant bending this rule? I understand staying in cash overnight practically eliminates serious risk, on the same token I'm wondering if there are any occasions that will excuse an exception.


And just to note, I've got a decent grasp on how much of a joke this industry is. It seems to me the people who make these shill companies (or ""sponsor"" them) simply keep a ring of accounts with different brokers and move 50-80% of the market cap between their own accounts. Essentially creating a fake market, with huge volume at almost no real cost, then soaking in whatever dumb money shows up to buy a hyped stock that never had any real substance or business behind it. Kinda fucked how the market is more profitable than the business itself.


Thanks for any insight you have guys. I'm not trying to become a millionaire but if I can get the hang of this it'd be an excellent side hustle.

UWTI 5 day SMA is 3.02 for example.  Buy under when 3.02, once UWTI goes up, sell, and buy DWTI when it goes below its indicator. rinse, and repeat.  It seems like this would do well until a major trend breaks out, then you change your angle of attack.  By working with both in todays volatility it seems like you would be shifting your risk towards the odds of a major trend breaking out quickly rather than DWTI or UWTI doing poor for a couple of days or trending slowly.

CERE is likely a message board pump and dump. They might have a public offering soon which will kill the stockprice. I do not think it will hold up it's trend. Expecting it to at MOST spike to .60 then fall back down, where I will go short risking off the high of the day. I honestly do not like stocks at this price, the r/r is always a lot more scary when there is a lot of potential percentage loss. Only shorting parabolic moves / adding into short on pops.

OREX I wish I got in on the dips today, I knew it had a really clear trend. Unfortunately I think it will gap down (so much emotion in one stock it's crazy). Expecting a washout to the lower 7's (7 - .25)! I honestly will only be shorting a pop on a washout BELOW 7, and will be risking 7. It is realllly a messy stock and to me honest, it isn't something I like to trade.

NVGN is most likely up on this: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-studies-confirm-ability-of-trxe-009-to-kill-brain-cancer-stem-cells-2015-03-04?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts). I really hope this stock holds up and doesn't just washout right away tomorrow. Ideally it pops back over 3.5 and I could get a position in risking on the high of the day. Shorting into pops and parabolic moves.


IFON is clearly up on this: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/infosonics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2014-results-2015-03-04?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts). Expecting it to parabolic in the morning to ideally the 3 - .15 mark, where it will hopefully get stuffed. In a odd case where it parabolics way past it, I will look to short a parabolic move to 3.3 - .55 range. Will be shorting parabolic moves, not shorting ""line in the sand""

15-03-05,Turning into a HedgeFundManageresque Investor,"I’ve been in the Hotel Industry all my life.  Parents had a hotel, so I grew up in it.  College comes around I work at Hotel part-time.  That becomes full time, then manager, then become GM.  Bounce around a few places as GM getting more and more experience in operations.  After this I was ready for the next step, I traveled and contemplated what it would be.  Created a start-up that is Hotel related.  Started slow, but then started gaining momentum.  A year later I am doing very well. 
Was asked to invest into a hotel.  They wanted my expertise.  They know what I can do turning hotels around.   Go over financials.  They were all right, but looking at other factors, knew it was a diamond in the rough (have since streamlined this into my criteria for investment) Negotiated with my partner’s that I would only invest if my company were hired to manage certain aspects.  They agree.  This got me thinking.  Now this hotel has been doing great, close to 27% cash on cash return.  I actively start contacting brokers, searching the Internet, and going to conventions.  I am absorbing knowledge on everything on the investment side of hotels.   By this time people are contacting me to help them.  I invest in second hotel.  I found the project, got the financials outlined, and found investors.  This one works out to 23% cash on cash.  Next 8 yield even higher returns.  Nothing has decreased my forecasted gains.  Actually, the opposite has occurred.  One reason I can give faith to the investors is I, personally, invest with them.

	Now I’m looking to expand my pool of investors to that of non-hotel investors.  I’ve been lurking long enough and reading and reading on r/investing and pf, and know that people are looking for great investment’s that are risk adverse as possible.  How do I open myself to this?   I’ve been on here long enough to know that anytime you throw around guarantee to run to hills, but hypothetically can I offer a guarantee of lets say 8% with no fees, just an annual return guarantee.  The catch would be I would have to hang to it for at least 5 years, and I wouldn’t be able to invest people that came to if I didn’t have a project at that time.  How do I turn this into a trustworthy business?

My question is two-fold: Why isn't this the best thing ever? If the return is say 20% and the trust closes 10 years from now, then an initial investment of $1000 would net 10 * 200 = $2000 - which is $1000 on top of original investment (or basically 10% gain/year).

15-03-05,My thesis on the oil supply,"I recently typed up some research (really just thumbing through EIA records) on historical US crude oil supply and demand in the first half of 2014, how it compares to this year, and what we might be able to infer from this data.

I posted this as a response in another ""investment"" sub, but thought I would post it here as well for more exposure.

I'm not sure why oil moved higher today, as I thought the news on US crude inventory growth was very bearish. See here for the EIA report: http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/pdf/highlights.pdf

I've been looking for some reason why the price might move up. I've seen some news sources claim its due to weaker than expected inventory growth at Cushing, and an expected increase in the refineries input in the near future as strikes/bad weather end.

However, I went and looked at the records from EIA on the refinery capacities last year when oil reached its peak. Here is the information I found:

* January refinery capacity: 87.7% Inventories: 358.1 mb
* February refinery capacity: 87.3% Inventories: 363.8 mb
* March refinery capacity: 86.3% Inventories: 380.1 mb
* April refinery capacity: 90.3% Inventories: 397.6 mb
* May refinery capacity: 89.5% Inventories: 389.5 mb
* June refinery capacity: 88.7% Inventories: 384.9 mb
* July refinery capacity: 93.4% Inventories: 365.6 mb

I didn't include the months after July as that was when oil started to decline in price.

Last year the inventories didn't even stop growing until sometime in May, and they actually grew at their fastest pace in April. There was a net change of +5.7 million barrels from January 2014 to February 2014. There was a net change of -19.3 million barrels from June 2014 to July 2014. The total change in inventory growth between these two times was 25 million barrels.

Here is the data so far for this year:

* January refinery capacity: 88.6% Inventories: 413.1 mb
* February refinery capacity: 88.2% Inventories: 444.4 mb

So far the net change between January 2015 and February 2015 has been +31.3 million barrels. Even when summer is in full swing, the normal yearly decline in inventory grow won't be enough to offset the current growth unless something changes.

Furthermore, everyone makes a big deal about the refinery strikes, and they make a big deal about the effect weather has on the refineries. But the numbers don't agree with this, as refineries are at higher operating capacity this year than they were last year. Demand is actually up since last year. The problem isn't demand. The problem is massive supply.

I looked at the 2013 data as well, and it is very similar to the 2014 data. Inventories grew at roughly the same speeds and then peaked in April before heading lower. Note that the refinery capacities were even lower in 2013 than they were in 2014, with an average capacity for February of only 83.5%. Knowing this, I feel confident in saying our refineries are absolutely not operating under capacity for this time of year.

I think people are finding excuses to push the price higher currently, the fact that Cushing had lower inventory growth than expected doesn't seem very important to me, as the total inventory growth was still up a staggering 22% from last week. That oil was all stored somewhere. If last year is any guide, we may expect refineries to process even less oil in March, and for inventories to grow at accelerating rates for at least the next two months.

On the flip-side, the gap between Brent and WTI is closing and I don't know why, so that worries me. I don't intend for anyone to make investment decisions based off of my limited research here. If you want to look through the weekly EIA reports for yourself you can find the historical issues I referenced here: http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/supply/weekly/archive/

1.	Saxo Bank dishonor CHF trades on January 15, 2015, after the SNB decision to remove the EURCHF floor. And yet no clients complain about it.

2.	Saxo Bank make up a price of EURCHF and other cross-CHF exchange rates with reference to EBS prices, replacing the prices it quoted to clients as a market maker, 12 hours after completion of transactions.

3.	Saxo Bank is convinced that tradable prices quoted on their trading platform were quoted by someone else instead of Saxo Bank itself.

4.	Saxo Bank believes that no one is curious on how Saxo Bank hedge against clients’ short CHF positions.

5.	Saxo Bank spend less than 1 minute to figure out how much they lose on their own CHF positions (cause it’s right on their screens), but they needed 12 hours to figure out how to allocate the losses to clients.

6.	On the second day of the Swiss Franc appreciation, Saxo Bank tell people that more clients joined them, despite they dishonor trades, manipulate trade records, detain clients’ assets and go after clients’ on the alleged debt that Saxo Bank booked to them.

7.	Saxo Bank believes that international clients will not sue them in Denmark due to the language barrier.

8.	Saxo Bank believes that they can pocket this windfall gain from clients’ assets and next year they can go to IPO.

9.	Saxo Bank still cannot understand why some brokers such as Oanda forgive retail clients’ negative balances – though these brokers dare not to manipulate trade records.

10.	Danish FSA and regulators around the world decide to forgive Saxo Bank. Saxo Bank continues to write outrageous predictions for 2016.

I'm 28 years old working in the IT field. I lived in an apartment right next to work (literately 2 min walk). The convenience of being that close to work was amazing, but I decided last month that I would like to work towards purchasing a condo / townhouse and stop throwing money down the drain in renting. 

It so happens that my father also works for the same company and he lives elsewhere. I've asked my parents if it was okay to move in with them for a year to save up money to purchase my first townhouse / condo. 

We commute together to work and I plan on saving 64% of my net income in savings for a year to purchase a townhouse / condo.

Based on those savings, by next year I should have 43k to my name. This is sufficient enough for me to make a down payment and not incur any property insurance taxes on top of it ( or whatever you call it ). Is a savings account the best place to put this extra money that I accrue per month? Obviously, I'll need it by next year so liquidity is key.

I live in GA and noticed I don't qualify for GA dream home purchase ( GA State benefit program) because my income is higher than the median average and my credit score is near the 750's. Is there a first time home purchase benefit I can receive that I'm not aware of?

* Among these 4 funds I am having trouble deciding which to invest. It seems like I can get lower fees by splitting my international investment between developed and emerging markets, because I would be holding a 9 and 15 bp fund instead of one 14 bp fund.

* If this free lunch exists, why isn't the E/R on the international funds lower? Is this a free lunch?

* What is the difference between the two international funds? One has 2467 stocks and the other has 5808 stocks. Their top 10 holdings are the same and their asset allocation across regions is the same to within 1%. It sounds like VTIAX is just a more extensive and more diversified version of VFWAX. Is this true? hence is VTIAX strictly better?

So my decision comes down to VTMGX + VEMAX vs. VFWAX vs. VTIAX. Advice?

This sticks out to me ""if you put all your spare change (roughly $200 a year) into that same index fund every year? After ten years you’d have over $3,100 just from spare change.

Note: spring please come

**GERN** I am not certain why it is up so much. It is kinda sketchy, we will see how it goes. If the stock is unable to break over 3.8, I will short risking off it. Most likely it will spike to 4, fail to break, then collapse; I will be short risking off the high of the day if that happens.

**MIXT** I am actually going to trade this differently. If the stock has a red day lower than 3%+ with decent volume (200k+) I will short holding overnight. I haven't done this kind of trading in a while but I found it to be the most successful (for me).

**CTIC** had a technical breakout above 2.50. Too bad I missed it. It really squeezed hard at the end of the day today. I expect it to washout back to the 2.50 mark, and will use it as a guide. If it holds I will go long risking off it. I will be adding on dips.

**XXII** it isn't clear why this stock is up. Most likely just a short squeeze + momentum buyers on the 1 break. Ideally it will parabolic to the 1.40 mark then fail to break it. I will be going short risking off the high of the day. By the way, what am I looking at here LOL: (http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=xxii&amp;insttype=&amp;freq=2&amp;show=&amp;time=20)

15-03-06,ANTH - Handling a rising stock approaching an earnings call,"Long-time subscriber, first-time poster. I picked up some shares of Anthera Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ANTH) primarily based on a consistent surge early in the year as well as some impressively high historical prices. I got in at $4.67 with a plan to exit if the stock dropped to $4.00 but with no true ceiling in mind. The stock has continued to rise and has reset its 52-week high the last two days, now currently sitting at $6.10 (30.6% increase from initial investment).

Anyway, my question is how I should approach this earnings call on Monday. The stock is continuing to rise today as much as 10% in what I assume is in anticipation of this call. Any advice on resetting my exit strategy on this one? I've ready some analysts have the short-term range up to $10/$11 which tempts me to hang on, but I question if I'm being greedy by expecting more than 30% going into an earnings call.

Any advice would be appreciated, hopefully this is the appropriate type of question for this subreddit. Thanks!",3

15-03-06,"It is not about how much you have, it is about the returns","Unless you have millions, of course. Then the returns still matter, but not so much, you can live quite well on what your millions make on a 3% savings account. I was checking my net worth the other day, and realized my investments give me a monthly return just over 1%. That is the almost certain part, like rental income. Having three different tenants, and one of the nicest flatshares in a UK college/university town, I am fairly confident my rooms will have a high occupancy rate. Over four years of ownership, I have had one empty room for one week, all the other tenants moved in the day after the previous left. So I consider this fairly stable passive income, if real estate can be considered passive. I do not include returns from riskier investments in that 1%, as those are never guaranteed until they are in your bank account.

 

How much do you need?
I do not have a budget, so I spend what I need to spend each month, but life is cheap in Guatemala so that is rarely more than $700 per month, handyman included, since my little house is fully paid for.

Add to that a month in Europe every year at $2,500, i.e. an additional $2,100 (I still pay the handyman and a few bills while away) to the yearly budget, and another $1,500 trip somewhere else, you get to $1,000 per month. This is for basic living expenses and leisure, not for investing or savings, which is why I am targeting an income of $5,000 or more. At the moment, I have 5 full time staff working on my 90 acre land development plus some extras here and there, have put more than $20,000 in house repairs and construction since last October, bought a car, a boat, etc.

Also, my goal is to not have to go back to a cubicle, so $1,000 may do the trick today, but I may need $2,000 tomorrow, or see an investment go wrong and some sources of income dry up. Better safe than sorry, even more so considering I do not have an emergency fund.

You may need more or less, the important thing is defining how much money you need in the bank to sustain your lifestyle.

 

How much capital do you need?
 

At the 4% safe rate of withdrawal, I would need $300,000 to generate a $12,000 income per year. Or $1.5M to generate $5,000 per month. Building a nest egg that will allow you to maintain your lifestyle at 4% is not easy for everyone. According to Census.gov, the median net worth in the US is $68,800. It goes up to $240,800 for people with a graduate degree, and as low as $972 for a female householder under 35. With a $68,800 net worth, I would need an annual return of 17.4% to sustain my $1,000/month lifestyle. At 4%, I would only have $230 to live every month. You can see that the rate of return makes a big difference on the overall capital you will need to live off your wealth.

 

Take my cattle for example. It brought me a 38% return per year while it lasted. That was an exceptional investment, and it is unfortunately over. But if I had a way to keep the cattle forever, I would need to invest only $31,600 to cover my $1,000/month expenses.

At the 1% return I am currently getting, $100,000 would be enough to be financially independent. I know I am omitting inflation but I am just trying to prove a point. $100,000 is a pretty low number, and part of that would be my house, which is not bringing any income, although if you own a nice little $80,000 house in the Midwest, that number could be $150-$200K. Still far from the million and then some that people consider to be their magic retirement number.

$1,000,000 in the bank will never give you 1% per month. A “high interest” savings account may give you 2 or 3% annually at the moment which is barely enough to keep up with inflation while generating $1,000/month in passive income.

Now I hear you say “Guatemala is a cheap country, you were able to buy a house cash, and you get high returns by taking high risks”. True. So I have an all American, real life example for you. Paula over at Afford Anything bought a $21,000 3 bedroom foreclosure, brought its price up to $30K with repairs and rented it for $900/month. Her return after taxes, maintenance and so on is around 18% per year. A couple more houses at the same price mean you invest $90K and get $16,200 per year in rental income. After two years, if you saved that income, you can buy another house. And so on.

 

You can do it too
Generating more than market rate is possible for most people with a little cash who are willing to take risks. Paula’s tenants can disappear overnight, or stop paying rent for a few months and leave the place in dire need of repairs, eating up the profit. Stock plummets, companies go bankrupt, inflation gets in the way.

But with several sources of income, and a balanced portfolio that includes both risky investments and a few safe ones, you may realize that financial independence isn’t as far away as you originally thought.

Those that answer Bad mostly due so based on their spending habits and struggles to save.

There's a massive personal finance industry that produces countless books, articles, seminars and tools in an attempt to address these struggles. However what is completely missed is the underlining self-identity people hold in relation to money. Their perceived relationship with money and its affect on their lives. 

Telling someone who believes they are ""bad with money"" that all they need to do is simply set a budget or drink less Starbucks latees is like telling an alcoholic that all they need to do is drink less. 

The personal finance industry is missing this relationship with money. A person needs to be empowered in their relationship with money before they can truly utilize all the countless tips and tricks the personal finance industry loves to discuss. The what and how of money is important but the underlying relationship is a critical first step.

So question time: Its currently @ $34.35 as I type this. Nothing but growth the last year and change. But with my inexperience in that time I didn't buy more AMC, I played around with other areas. Disregarding the varying success and less than successful attempts I've made, do any of you more experienced traders see any potential in buy more AMC? I should have bought more in the 20 dollar range, but inexperience kept me cautious from putting in any more money, and hindsight is a bitch.",1

15-03-06,The Finance Department at my University is overwhelmingly marginalized.,"10,000+ student population, 42,000 dollar tuition, 180 year history, and our business school has no formal student financial organization.

I'm currently a junior finance major at a private university and our financial program is overwhelmingly lackluster. In comparison, our close cousins over at the accounting program have fraternities, tutoring options, networking organizations, and an amazing accounting faculty while the financial department has non of the above.

So my friend and I are working to change that.

We're starting up a student financial organization that we're working to charter within our university regulations. We're working closely with a financial professor that was willing to represent us, however, his hands are weighed down with other obligations and priorities.

At this point we really just need more help and ideas. Right now the organization is pretty lackluster, and without much value to attract people to it.


So far we are working on obtaining financial professionals to come speak at our university as well as working to implement a foundation to participate in the CFA Institute Research Challenge.

Were there any opportunities in college that helped you progress in a financial aspect that we could potentially implement? Or were there opportunities you wish you would have known about that could have helped you? If you could look back into your educational career what opportunities would you tell past you to take advantage of?

Hopefully your ideas and comments will help us establish a platform and opportunities for our marginalized financial department.

Chase has a ton of banks around the country (I have been to the bank ~10 times in the last year, in 2 different states on opposite sides of the country, 3 locations total in different demographic regions.  They are WASTING SO MUCH REAL ESTATE.  Will they lose even more money if they continue adding to the real estate problems?  (I know, much of this is debatable, not the point). 
tl;dr; they are wasting staff and money on physical locations

But wait...I LOVE them.  I get the most personalized service.  I asked a few people (mentors, entrepreneurs, etc.) who they use; everyone said Chase small business checking.  Me personally, I will go back to them consistently (already have for two accounts yet still don't switch my personal checking because I'm with someone else and it is easy to stay).  Chase may have a large majority of new business accounts, which means in 3-30 years, if they keep this up, will be the bank supporting most businesses, etc.  So this is why I say BUY BUY BUY.

15-03-06,What Millennials Want (in terms of investing). Long read.,"Millennials are still in the very early stages of market participation: those under 35 own just 4% of mutual fund assets, but the 80-90 million millennials will soar in importance to everyone in the wealth/asset management business before too long. Through inheritance alone, millennials stand to receive $30 trillion in the next few decades. Where they start will often be where they grow. Some, like Wealthfront and forward thinking financial advisors, are tapping into this young potential already. So, if you are in the financial services business, how can you do the same?

I’ve learned a lot about young people and what they want since publishing Millennial Money late last year, and I believe these findings are relevant for financial advisors, millennial investors, and all those trying to win their business. The book has given me great access. Here’s what I’ve learned.

Young People Don’t Trust You

Millennials have a big issue with trust. In a very recent survey of wealthier millennials, just 19% agreed that advisors in general have their clients’ best interests at heart. 40% actively disagreed with this notion. Millennials are selfish (in a good way): with everything they buy, they want to know they are getting the most value possible for the price. In this same survey, 72% of them responded that they are “self-directed” investors and 41% said they’d received no financial advice.

Most of the millennials in this survey had more than $3M to invest and more than a quarter of them had more than $10M. They equated advisors with salesmen.

The solution is to educate them, rather than sell them. I like the idea that “when you sell, you break rapport, but when you educate, you build it.” [i]

This education can come in many forms. Regular white papers, commentary, blog posts, even twitter messages that teach investors why your style of investing/way of doing business makes sense and will work. If you are a financial advisor, do an event with your clients AND their children. The single most effective event I’ve done was a night at a club in LA, hosted by one of the best advisor teams we work with. I made a short presentation to 50 or so young people, many of whom were the children of the advisor’s top clients. These people were extremely hungry to learn, but just hadn’t had the chance or the time. I’ve heard from many of them since that night and two things stand out. One, they want to hear more about investing strategies, and two they want to build a relationship with an advisor who can help them learn.

Education is key. It builds trust and can secure multi-generational relationships.

Young People Like Three Key Attributes In Investing Strategies

A specific style of investing strategy resonates with millennials. Three criteria stand out: these strategies are rules-based, transparent, and mindful of fees and costs. Millennials have thus far liked index funds because they meet these criteria so well. I am naturally a bit biased given that O’Shaughnessy Asset Management manages quantitative/systematic strategies. We like to think that we are marrying the best aspects of active and passive investing: the disciplined, consistent, rules based approach of an index with a much more effective strategy based on principles like valuation, quality, momentum, and total yield.

Millennials like index funds, but they also like systematic strategies. I won’t explore Smart Beta here, because it means so many things, but the idea of a rules-based, systematic strategy has resonated well with young investors. They can understand it because they understand the rules. They are transparent. They tend to charge reasonable fees. Only 20% of wealthy millennials though that fees in our business were reasonable. Reaching them with these kinds of strategies works. They like index funds, but are also open to active strategies.

Young Investors Will Demand Automation—So Embrace Technology Now

Have you tried signing up for Wealthfront or Acorns? I have. It’s insanely easy. I get physically uncomfortable and annoyed when I want something and I can’t get it easily—in under 10 minutes, from my iPhone, sitting on my couch. And I am probably on the patient end of my generation. We are spoiled rotten by technology, so financial services solutions need to be easy, accessible, and fast as possible. Obviously there will be limitations depending on your line of business, but the smoother and easier and more automated you can make the experience the better your chances with millennials now and in the future.

If you run a business and don’t have a programmer, hire one. If you have one, hire more. At O’Shaughnessy Asset Management, our large programming team has become the lifeblood of our firm. We are quantitative investors who test myriad different strategies on historical data. Back in 2007, when I had an idea that I wanted to test, it took me roughly 36 hours to set up the test, run the historical simulation, collect the results, and perform the analysis. That same sequence takes me about 10-15 minutes today. I can answer just about any question about market history in minutes because of the technology at my fingertips. Doing the same in your business by automating as much as possible can make a huge difference. Imagine if all the repetitive tasks associated with your business went away, and imagine the time that would free up to focus on the areas where you are really skilled. These kinds of tasks are a hassle, removing them is good for you.

I am no proponent of modern portfolio theory or the efficient market hypothesis, yet I still send tons of people to Wealthfront. I do so because it is so easy that I know people will actually get started, and because friends who have $10,000 to invest will appreciate the very solid service. It’s not perfect, but it’s infinitely better than doing nothing. In ten years, those same people might have $1,000,000 with the same company.

Don’t Be Evil, Be Human

I am repentant for my former skepticism of blogs and twitter. For a long time I thought they were unprofessional. I couldn’t have been more wrong. These venues sync up with the millennial audience so well. They are transparent, they build trust, they help you educate your audience, and to connect with them in a way that is human, not just professional.

I think that is all young people (or maybe just people) really want: helpful services, charging fair prices, offered by people who are fundamentally good and honest.

It is amazing how different the world of finance is. Here is a passage from Tragedy and Hope (an amazing history of the early 20th century), about banking and the bankers that more or less ran the world:

“they remained as private unincorporated firms, usually partnerships, until relatively recently, offering no shares, no reports, and usually no advertising to the public…This period, 1884-1933, was the period of financial capitalism in which investment bankers moving into commercial banking and insurance on one side and into railroading and heavy industry on the other were able to mobilize enormous wealth and wield enormous economic, political, and social power. Popularly known as “Society,” or the “400,” they lived a life of dazzling splendor. Sailing the ocean in great private yachts or traveling on land by private trains, they moved in a ceremonious round between their spectacular estates and town houses in Palm Beach, Long Island, the Berkshires, Newport, and Bar Harbor; assembling from their fortress-like New York residences to attend the Metropolitan Opera under the critical eye of Mrs. Astor; or gathering for business meetings of the highest strategic level in the awesome presence of J. P. Morgan himself.”

Some might argue that this still happens to some extent today. But remember that when millennials were asked to identify their ten most hated brands, the four big banks all made the list.

Google’s motto “don’t be evil” is a great starting point for the financial services industry today.

Getting Them to Act Is the Hardest Part

Usually we need to be discontent or frustrated to take action. The further away a problem is in time, the less motivated we are to do something about it. The problem should be clear: millennials have decades before retirement.

The philosopher Eric Hoffer wrote an amazing book on mass movements called The True Believer, which I recommend to everyone. In the book he says, it is not the distant kind of hope, but the “around-the-corner brand of hope that prompts people to act.” It is so hard to envision a period 40-50 years in the future, and even harder to get people to act for a reward so distant. I’ve learned this firsthand the hard way. I spent too much time selling young people on 40-year returns, trying to appeal to their reason. They all nod their heads, agree, and then do nothing.

Instead I should have been appealing to emotions and immediate needs. If you are an advisor, don’t just sell the potential for long term wealth (although that is good), but also the benefits of working with you that they will feel immediately that may be frustrating them now.

Think of Maslow’s pyramid, his hierarchy of human needs. People will act most readily to satisfy their most basic needs. In the case of investing, shelter is key. Millennials need the equivalent of a financial shelter, but with a negative 2% savings rate, they aren’t building financial shelters. I think introducing first the idea of building a financial shelter—to cover short term needs when they arise—is a powerful way to get millennials interested and started saving.

Investing comes next. Again, a 40 year compound growth number sounds great, but it doesn’t precipitate action. So frame it differently. We are twice as sensitive to losses and negative things as gains or positive things. Frame the need to invest negatively. Don’t say invest with me and you’ll be rich in 40 years. Say save and invest more now and you won’t risk being without support now and in the future. You might think this is a slimy sales tactic, but it’s not. Anything that gets young people started sooner is a good thing.

Consider this. Two groups were asked to explore a virtual world using virtual reality goggles. In the virtual world, the members of each group eventually came across a mirror which showed either their current face or a version of their face which had been digitally enhanced to make them look like what they will at age 70. When asked later in the experiment, the group which saw the aged photos said they’d plan to save at twice the rate as those which saw the normal photos. The effect of the aged photo made them emotional but also made old age seem closer, and more immediate. These are useful lessons in motivation.

Playing the Millennial Long Game

Young investors haven’t built up a huge collective fortune—so right now they are not the biggest or most important clients. By time will take care of that. Should robo-advisors—who are counting on riding this millennial wave—be valued at the multiples they are? As a group, probably not. But one or more of them will be huge because they are finely tuned in to the preferences of their current and prospective clients.

I believe that the profile of a firm or strategy that will win millennials’ business and help them succeed is as follows. It will use technology to automate as much as possible and make working with the company easy and efficient, because millennials will demand it. It will be transparent and good. It will focus on rules based asset allocation and selection strategies with low fees. Finally, it will deal with them in a way that educates and builds trust and provides not just solid long term results, but also immediate help in areas that millennials are frustrated.

As Gretzky always said, skate to where the puck is going.

15-03-07,Convertible Bonds,"Hi All,

Quick question: Why can you consider a convertible bond the same as the underlying bond + a call option on the stock of the issuer?

If you have a convertible bond, you convert it to common stock and you end up with the total value of that stock

If you have a bond and a call option on stock, and you exercise the call option, you have the total value of the stock + the value of the bond, which will be greater than the above

The only thing I can think of is: Do we assume that the bond is sold, and the bond price is used to pay the strike price of the option?

Thanks",20

15-03-07,"Why are brokerages so 'slow'?","I was hoping to pick /r/investing's brain about this. I'm a computer guy, and I've worked in the back-offices of banks before.

I bought some stock yesterday, using cash that was in the brokerage account. It's going to take several days for the settlement to clear. When I sell stock it can take a week or two for things to clear. It seems like it all ought to be instant.

Perhaps most annoying is the tax stuff. All my other tax documents land pretty shortly after the new year (starting with my mortgage provider, which usually gets me my paperwork on the first business day of January).

15-03-07,UDOW vs ^DJI,"I was curious about what I'd find when comparing an ultra leveraged ETF like UDOW with its underlying (DJIA.)

Since UDOW's inception in Feb 2010, the DJIA has gone up 78% while UDOW has gone up more than 5x as much.

https://imgur.com/Fa36KFH

From Feb 2010 to Dec 2011, UDOW hovered at the 50$ mark. Starting 01/02/2012, UDOW took off on a tear rising from ~$50 to ~$142 today. 

In the period starting 01/02/2012, we had roughly 800 trading days. There were 61 days when the Dow closed 1% or higher above the previous day's close and 49 days when the Dow closed 1% or more below the previous day's close.

So, the twelve extra days when the Dow rose 1% or more accounted for a good proportion of the 2x difference between the promised 3x and actual 5x returns.

UDOW pays out dividends so that can't be it. ",0

15-03-07,What Do You Think Of The Titanium Dioxide Industry?,"I've been keeping an eye on Tronox Limited ($TROX) for a while. The company has paid dividend since 2012. It was in a general uptrend since early 2013, but recent slump in crude oil prices dragged it down with it. The stock has just reached its 52 week low, following today's stock market dip sparked by the fear of interest rate hike.

Tronox produces and sells Titanium Dioxide pigment and mineral sands - an industry I'm not familiar with. Titanium Dioxide, I read on SA, is used in making paint, plastics, paper, and pharmaceuticals.

The people who don’t invest. Maybe they heard too many horror stories from their relatives or friends who got burned in the market. So they completely decide not to touch investing at all. That’s a very lazy mentality. Because if you don’t invest, you are already losing money every year – guaranteed.
Why? Because inflation. 

You might say inflation isn’t much of a big deal. Imagine this.

I’m your best friend in the world, and you totally trust me. If I borrow money from you, I would definitely return it to you. So scenario A, I want to borrow $10K from you, and I will return to you in a week. You would probably say yes, right? Come on, we’re best friends forever, you better say yes.

Now in scenario B, I want to borrow $10K from you, and I will return to you in 10 years time. You wouldn’t say no, right? Because you understand that in 10 years time, $10K is worth much lesser than it is now. That’s the effect of inflation, it reduces your money. It’s the public number 1 enemy.

So please, start thinking about investing as soon as possible.


**2) The gambler/speculator**

These are the people who make a quick buck in the market and then burned their fingers when something happens. These are the people who call themselves investors but had never even look once at the annual reports of the companies they bought. These are the people who buy the hottest companies which are being talked about everyone, and anyone, even the cab driver who sent him to his office in the morning.


A true story of my friend:
Lets call him S. So we were out having dinner. We just chatting and realized that he had bought some stocks. So, I asked him what he bought. He said he bought company X, but he lost money. I asked him based on what reasons he bought. He said because someone we both knew asked him to buy. So he didn’t bother to do analysis on the company before he decided to buy – pure speculating on other people’s hearsay. I was wondering he would jump off the building if I told him to.

Then we went on to discuss another company which just went IPO, it was our mutual friend’s company. We were both invited to buy the shares at pre-IPO price, $1 (not actual amount). Both of us didn’t buy. I told him I didn’t analyse so I didn’t buy the shares. He told me he didn’t buy because he felt that the IPO was pre-mature, and the founder, our friend, made a wrong decision.

At the point during our meet up, the price of the company already went up to $2 (double the pre-IPO price), and he proceeded to tell me, “oh by way, I didn’t buy at $1, I bought at $2”.

I was like “WHAT?!”

I proceeded to ask him a few questions.

ME: What’s your valuation on the company?
S: Don't know.

ME: What’s your margin of safety on the company?
S: Don't know.

ME: What cash flow of the company?
S: Don't know.

ME: What’s revenue of the company?
S: Don't know.

ME: Did you analyze the company?
S: No.

ME: Did you download annual report and looked though?
S: No.

By the end of the questions, I concluded that this friend of mine, wasn’t investing, he was just gambling with his money. So please, don’t be like my friend. If you want to gamble, go to the casino at Marina Bay, at least you will lose money faster, and it goes to the government, which might then to build better public transportation for the rest of us.


**3) The hardworking DIY investor**

These are the people who are serious in investing. They don’t go out as much, they save the money on expensive clothes or meals, so they can invest. They invest in themselves, paying for education, and learn how to really invest from other successful investors. They will put in the time and effort to do research on companies, and the market, meet up with the management teams of companies, before they make their move.

This will definitely increase your chance of making money in investing. However, there’s a chance of you losing money. Not everyone is good at investing, even if you learn, you can be good, but you won’t be superb if you do not have the inner talent.

Not to mention, you will have to put in some serious time, energy, and effort to learn. So more studying, and less play-time for you.


**4) The lazy investor**

Then, we have the lazy investors. These are the people who say “let the pros do it”. Lets face it. If given a chance not to work, and still have money to spend, most of us will not be working. So, is there a way to still make money investing without doing the work all by yourself? Yes, there is.

Ever heard of fund managers? These are the people who paid well, so that their main focus is help the investors who invested in their fund to make money. Know these managers make how much in salary? A good range is about $100K. 

Now think about this carefully. It’s not one investor paying $100K this fund manager to make money for him, it’s thousands of investors coming together, paying him a small fee, so that his sole purpose of his job is to help the investors make money. This is a great form of cost sharing, yes? You’re paying maybe 1-1.5% of management fee to the company, so that you don’t have to do all that tedious work of reading annual reports, analyzing companies, and meeting the management teams of companies – the lazy way of investing.

You’re right, having a fund manager investing your money for you doesn’t mean you will definitely make money. There’s no guarantee in investing. If there is, it’s probably a scam. However, the chance of you making money beats the lazy investor and the gambler/speculator.

You might also say, “I can do it all by myself, I think I’m better than this fund manager guy”.  You maybe right too, but you could also be a little too arrogant. These fund managers are well-paid because they are in fact good at what they do, and they mainly focus all their time and energy at work so they can add value and make money for their company and the investors, like yourself, and lastly, it’s their job!


**So which kind of investor are you?**

So you need to decide what kind of investor you are, the non-investor, the gambler, the hardworking DIY one, or the lazy investor. The first two, non-investor and gambler are definitely No-No. What’s left is the hardworking DIY investor or the lazy investor – choose between one of these two.

***[http://i.imgur.com/GsS8PUK.png](http://i.imgur.com/GsS8PUK.png)***

These are **Total Returns** which means they include reinvested dividends.
 
These are not ""Real"" returns, rather ""Nominal"" returns, or not adjusted for inflation.

Unfortunately, I cannot change the title of the OP here on reddit, but the image table has been corrected from ""Real"" to ""Nominal"". 
  
This was updated from AllFinancialMatters.com using [this table through 2012](http://i.imgur.com/krF0Gia.png), and updating the 20-year perdiods ending 2013 and 2014 using [this S&amp;P 500 Return Calculator](http://dqydj.net/sp-500-return-calculator/).

In my table, I've noted that since 1932, there have been 64 rolling 20-year periods, and 92% of them have had average annualized returns of about 8% or higher.

Since 1963, there have been 33 rolling 20-year periods, and 100% of them have had average annualized returns of about 8% or higher.

If you don't know me my name is Chris and I post my watchlists every night in /r/stockmarket and I lurk around here now and then. I'm a full time trader but recently I opened a small Robinhood account to mess around with. I decided to make a public project out of my Robinhood trades to see what I can do with the small $1,000 account which I opened on 3/1/15. As it says in the sub this is considered a sunk cost already for me so there's a possibility that I will just blow the entire account, but I wanted to see what was possible when commissions aren't involved in trading a small account like many new traders might start with.

More details are in the subreddit at http://www.reddit.com/r/1kRobinhoodProject

Let me know if you have any suggestions on how to improve it - I've restricted it to only me being able to post for now but thought everyone else could subscribe if they want to follow along.
Hope you like, and godspeed to my $1,000! As of 3/6/15 I have made two trades and so far booked about a 17% gain on the account. It should be fun to see what's possible since I've seen a lot of new traders start with this size account in the past and just burn it up w/ fees even if they were good traders. I know if I had to go back and start all over again I would want to start with a lot more than this, but maybe it will be different w/ Robinhood! In the mean time also feel free to follow the watchlists and ideas I post in /r/stockmarket each night as those I'm trading mostly in my main account that I use to make a living and they seem to be well received and pretty educational over there :)

15-03-08,Investing Abroad,"This might be a longer post, but the **essential question** is how can I invest in stock indexes in other countries. Particularly, I would like to invest in the NGSEINDX (Nigeria Stock Ex All Share) and then the Shanghai Index.

So the reason I am looking into this is because the NGSEINDX dropped quite a bit last year and I would like to invest in it. I fully understand it is a somewhat unstable region, but I have money that I am willing to lose making this investment (I am in HS all income is disposable atm). The drop was unprecedented but seemingly related to the political instability and low oil prices. However, the country as a whole seems to have a growing economy and one of the biggest in Africa. I really do think that it has a chance of increasing. 

The second index, for those who are interested, I am interested in for the future. I believe China is approaching an economic crisis and the best time to buy would be right after he crisis occurs. The impending crisis I only came across after doing some research into the Chinese real estate market and uncovered some alarming news. I am sure many of the people on this sub already know or have discovered this before me, but I believe housing prices dropped almost 5% quite recently. This in combination with a tweet I saw from a person affiliated with Citigroup which showed a chart indicating 724,000 margin accounts were opened in December '14. Chinese margin rules are very lax and the banks who are giving out the loans are somewhat sketchy. The accounts are being used to invest in Real Estate Stocks and all the value of these companies are somewhat sham. They make ghost towns, they make property no one ever buys. Either way it seems like soon at some point China will face serious problems and I'd like to know how to get in after the crash.",7

15-03-08,How do we benefit from the growing trend of passive investing?,"There seems to be an accelerating trend of passive investing in low cost index funds (should be fairly obvious to anyone that's spent more than 10 minutes browsing any finance related sub on reddit). I think I read somewhere that 30% of new fund flows into equity markets were in passive indices last year versus around 15% a decade ago. 

My thought is that probably by 2020, you could see passive investing breach 50% of total fund flows. If and when this happens, active investors may not drive the market anymore. Passive investors will pour ""blind"" capital into the major indices like the S&amp;P 500 without any differentiation for the companies being purchased. This will drive up major indices regardless of macroeconomic conditions or company specific valuations. If over 50% of fund flows into the market are passive, even if all remaining active participants in the market tried to stop the bull run, they wouldn't be able to.

Recognizing that this is a trend, as an active investor, is there anyway we can benefit from this? Obviously, the first thought is that if this is really going to happen, we shouldn't fight the trend and just go long passive indices. This could lead to a bubble, but I think we are very early in the process. Passive investors are trained to never try to time the market (which means they will never sell). So this bubble could persist for decades as there is no mechanism in place to deflate the bubble.

My other thought is that if we see a continued wave of passive investing, the market could become inefficient since passive investing by default makes the market LESS efficient. This, in turn, would give active investors greater ability to identify and profit from market inefficiencies. 

Any other thoughts? Am I completely off base? Again, I am not talking about the market TODAY. I am talking about the market 10 years from now. While there will always be a subset of the population that will try to beat the market and participate in active investing, if this number shrinks below 50%, I think you could see a completely different market. I'm envisioning a world where  robo-advisors are the norm and the majority of people are in passive funds. 

TL;DR - What will the state of the stock market look like 10 years from now? Will it be dominated by passive investing? If so, is there any way that we (as active investors) could benefit from this trend? ",33

**AXN** (http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=axn&amp;insttype=&amp;freq=9&amp;show=&amp;time=1) Had clear
resistance at 1.50. This stock is pretty basic, if it doesn't break out 1.50 I will be short risking off it. IMO I think this stock will play out very similarly to GERN on Friday intraday.

**CRMD** is not very clear why it's up so much, could be a pump. It looks verrrrrrrrrry similar to ADXS in December to January: (http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/quickchart/quickchart.asp?symb=adxs&amp;insttype=&amp;freq=1&amp;show=True&amp;time=7). The stock is at all time highs, which makes it very hard to predict where it will hold up. Expecting a potential parabolic over the 8.50 mark and will short risking off the high of the day. Also if the stock stuffs into the 8.50 mark and fails to break back over, I will be short risking off it.

**RGDO** reallllllly squeezed from the red to green PLUS a 1.35 longterm breakout. Expecting a parabolic to the 1.75 - 2 mark. Will be risking off the high of the day and shorting parabolic moves.

**ARQL** could reallllly rip up a lot on a technical breakout above 2.1. The stock is already extremely overextended that it will likely pull back eventually. Expecting a parabolic to the .35 - 50 Mark and obviously will be shorting risking off the high. I will also use the pre-market to try and set an exit point.

**FCEL** I am only putting this on the list because it has a longterm breakout above 1.4. I will go long if the stock begins to rip.

**RXII** is probably just a pump and a squeeze. I will go short if it fails to break above 1.6

Results within an hour.

In fact, I think no matter what happens, there will be a big bounce play today.

The only way there isn't is if it beats Jakafi (won't), or is at least 30% responder with minimal-no platelet loss (not even uncontrolled P2 data supports this).

I've been trying to school some big commentators on twitter about the actual mkt pacritinib is targeting, and the differences in the PERSIST and COMFORT trials, and even they were ignorant, and perhaps still remain ignorant. $$$$

15-03-09,Why Trend Following Isn’t that Useful Today,"In the past few posts I covered the basics of trend following and the critical flaw of trend following. That being said, I’d like to tell you a little bit about the history of trend following.

When Did Trend Following Work Well
Trend following started in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was originally used by commodity traders and investors in the commodity markets (oil, gold, silver, copper, etc) because the 1970s saw a massive secular bull market in commodities. That being said, it is obvious that trend following doesn’t work too well in a secular bear market because overall, a secular bear market means that the market merely whipsaws instead of trends.

Trend following was initially very profitable in the 1970s and 1980s – the biggest traders of the day were all trend followers. This includes the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Bruce Kovner, Richard Denise – all hotshots in the 1970s and 1980s.

Seeing the massive profits made with trend following, many investors and traders naturally became trend followers. With legions of new trend followers in the 1990s, the profitability of trend following started to deteriorate. By the early 2000s, trend following wasn’t that profitable at all because too many people started using it. So what changed? Why are no present day mega-successful investors and traders using trend following as their primary investment strategy?

What Changed
The nature of the stock, commodity, and currency markets changed. Prior to the 1970s, working on Wall Street or any career related to investing/trading was seen as unfashionable. Having an economics major back in the day was about as unfashionable as having an art history degree today (sorry to pick on y’all art history majors out there).

With virtually no competition out there, investing was actually pretty easy back in the 1970s (which was also somewhat true in the 1980s) compared to today. If you understand the basic trend following concepts, you could have made excess returns of 20%. Why? Because investing is a zero sum game (one winner for every loser), and in the 1970s most of the “money managers” out there were terrible at their job. If everyone else is absolutely terrible, all you need to be is a little above average. Investment success is relative. With greater competition means that investing is (in absolute terms) much harder than it used to be.

But by the late 1980s and early 1990s, a lot of people started using trend following as a “smart” investment strategy. So what happened was that the whole investment community got a whole lot smarter, and trend following techniques went from the forefront of smart investing to standard practice among investors and traders. Thus, the distinct advantage that trend following once gave investors disappeared.

Trend Following Today
In the post 2008 Market Crash world, very few highly successful investors, traders, and fund managers still massively employ trend following techniques. Reality is, trend following often doesn’t work well like it used to. For example, traditional trend following said that if the market price rose above a moving average, it’s time to BUY because a new bullish uptrend is starting to form. But theses days, the markets will often criss-cross the moving averages many times in a year, yielding a whole bunch of useless BUY/SELL signals. With an increase in volatility (market fluctuations), trend following technical indicators (like in a whipsaw market) often generate exactly the wrong buy/sell signals at precisely the wrong time.

That being said, although trend following is no longer a superior investment strategy, it still is a above average strategy that will yield above average investment returns. In the following posts, I will discuss my preferred method of investing – contrarian investing. See y’all next time!",1

15-03-09,5 RULES FOR PROFITABLE STOCK TRADING,"Stock trading is one of the few businesses in which you can double your money, lose money or run into colossal debts with a trading decision. Every stock trader loses money on some trades, but the fact that sets successful stock traders apart is that they have more winning trades than losing trades.

This piece seeks to explore five rules that successful stock traders have consistently used to increase their chances of being on the winning side of the market. I cannot guarantee that following these rules will ensure 100% profitability when you trade stocks; nonetheless, these rules will make it easier for you to maximize profits when you are in the right trade and they’ll help you minimize your losses when you are in a wrong trade.

#1: Invest in Your Education
The first rule and probably the most important rule for profitable stock trading is that you MUST invest in your education. I’m not asking you to go back to college or get additional qualifications, but nobody can consistently trade stocks profitably without a functional understanding of how the stock market works.

When investing in your education, you should strive to understand the major factors that move the markets because the stock market is more dynamic than static. You should understand different trading strategies and work with a strategy that fits your risk-taking quotient and your experience.

A Virtual Stock Exchange is good way to get started with your education.

#2: Develop an Entry, Escape, and Exit Strategy
You must be cold and calculating if you want to trade stocks profitably. You should decide on the price at which you’ll be interested in buying the stock and how much of the stock you’ll buy per time (Entry). You’ll also decide on how much profit you want to make and the price at which you’ll sell the stock if all goes well (Exit). You should also decide on how much losses you are prepared to take if the trade goes contrary to your expectation (Escape).

You should come with a trading plan and you must be disciplined enough to stick to your plan. You should also avoid becoming an accidental investor. Accidental investors buy stocks with a trading goal in mind; however, they might fall in love with the stock if it has a winning streak or they might start feeling pity for the company if it has a losing streak; hence, they usually hold on to stocks longer than necessary.

# 3: Master the Two Sides of the Coin
About 90% of people who enter the stock market usually come with the mindset of buying stocks at low prices and selling them at high prices. Hence, you’ll most likely be chasing highs by purchasing stocks in the hopes that their share prices will increase.

However, the fact remains that the most bullish stock in the market cannot consistently maintain a rising streak without the occasional dip, pullback or even a correction. In fact, stocks that are rising might drop as much as 60% of recent gains before they start another ascent. Hence, you should not be afraid to short stocks when they are clearly entering a losing streak.

#4: Trade Only when You Clear
All stocks provide valuable information with the buy and sell signals in their technical indicators. However, the simplest and probably most important buy/sell signal is the key resistant/support level. You should know how to identify the key support and resistant levels in order to trade stocks for profits when they are going upwards, downwards, or even sideways.

Successful traders go long when a stock triggers a breakout above a key resistance point, they short stocks on a breakdown below a key support level, and they trade stock options when stocks are going sideways. If you cannot read the buy/sell signal clearly, it doesn't hurt to sit on the cash for a day or two while the choppiness in the stock clears away.

#5: Don’t Buy/Sell Based on Hype
As much as I hate to be the proverbial wet blanket, I must tell you that more than half of the tips, info, and expert advice that you’ll read on the Internet or see on the TV about that one stock you must buy today are nothing more than hype.

Nothing beats doing your due diligence as explained in rule number 1 and entering the trade only after a careful consideration of rule number 2.

Hence if bond yields fall but the P/E of stocks remains constant, one should hold more stocks. If bond yields fall AND P/E of stocks rise in tandem, then no tactical change is necessary.

15-03-09,"3 Investing Costs All Linked? Behavior, Structured &amp; Tax.","Just highlights from Rick Ferri's thoughts on 3 biggest costs in investing. Basically, although I don't agree, Ferri things everyone is better off in index funds because we can't control ourselves, i.e. emotions. [Full read here](http://www.rickferri.com/blog/investments/3-costs-investors-must-control/), things that jumped out to me below:

The cost to invest in index is often couched in terms of expense ratios and commissions. These are important structural costs, but other costs are not so obvious.

Two large costs that are not obvious, and difficult to quantify, are behavioral and tax costs. Behavioral cost occurs when an investor turns over their portfolio more frequently than they should and tax cost is pretty obvious but often miscalculated.

Interestingly, the structural cost, behavioral cost and tax cost in a portfolio are claimed to be interrelated. The idea is that if an investor is paying high fees, they are turning their portfolio over more than a low-fee investor, and incurring a greater behavioral cost as well as paying more to taxes relative to their gains. 

Structural costs are generally available because most fund fees and expenses are required to be disclosed. However, tax costs are more difficult in that they have to be extracted from tax return data. Behavioral costs are the most elusive and difficult to quantify because there’s very little data available. It also doesn’t help that we're all overconfident and don’t want to be reminded of behavioral shortcomings.

Hitting on the two most misunderstood costs:

**Behavioral Cost** - The apparent link between high fund expenses and high portfolio turnover creates double-trouble for less sophisticated investors. Their structural costs are high so the returns of the funds are lower, then bad behavior drives down their returns further. In contrast, investors who use low-fee funds tend to favor buy-and-hold and this creates the added benefit of lowering behavior cost.

**Tax Cost** - There are three taxable events that can be caused by mutual funds investing, including index funds and ETFs. The events are ordinary dividend payments, capital gains from fund distributions, and realized gains created by a shareholder fund sale or a fund liquidating.


**TL;DR - linking the 3 costs** - *Again, I don't believe everyone falls into this, but just an interesting idea I guess.* Structural cost, behavioral cost and tax cost are interrelated. The less sophisticated tend to be more active when investing and choose high fee active funds and turn over their portfolios more frequently. This lowers their  return and widens the behavioral gap returns and they end up paying more in taxes relative to their gains. On the other hand, an investor using low-cost index funds and ETF are likely to capture more of the return by behaving well, which allows them to benefit from a lower relative tax burden on their gains.

15-03-09,KRFT dividend discrepancy?,"I have some shares of KRFT, and on 12/23/14, it had a $0.55 dividend, which I can confirm based on a dividend I actually received. However, if you look at Yahoo! Finance's dividend history, it shows double the dividend for that date:

http://finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=KRFT&amp;a=08&amp;b=17&amp;c=2014&amp;d=00&amp;e=9&amp;f=2015&amp;g=v

Other sources show the correct dividend, ie:

http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/krft/dividend-history

You'll note the previous dividend in the Yahoo link is correct.


Since I'm the farthest thing from an experienced investor, I'm just wondering if this is a mistake, or if this actually makes sense given some circumstance that I'm not familiar with. It looks like errant data to me, and I can't imagine any valid reason why, but my ignorance is significant enough that I don't feel comfortable just assuming they goofed up somehow. :)


And if you're wondering why I'm obsessing over one single entry that I know the correct answer for: I was writing a little perl script to monitor/calculate where I'm at automatically, which uses yahoo finance as a backend, and noticed that my numbers for KRFT were wrong. If it's a mistake, I'll have to hardcode an entry for that one date (which would be lame). If there's some reason, I might be able to figure out a way to account for it programmatically and not find out my numbers are off when it happens again in the future. :-/

15-03-09,May I kindly suggest that those looking for high risk/high reward consider 1%-3% of their net worth into Bitcoin?,"Hi Everyone,

I am what many would call a ""Bitcoin nerd"". I've been following this space very closely since the beginning of 2013, and boy oh boy it has been a ride. I'm very level headed in that I recognize it's current pros and cons.

Before I jump into more of the specifics of Bitcoin, for all intents and purposes this is the **TL;DR** that would describe Bitcoin for the majority of people if you don't understand it and/or aren't very technical people who just want to live their lives: Bitcoin is the first time we've had a FINITE digital currency that no single person/country is in charge of. Anyone in the world can participate in sending money to each other, and all they need is internet access to participate. **It truly is one of the more significant inventions of your lifetime.** I cannot stress that last sentence enough.

The reason I suggested it for investment purposes is this: think of how you use Facebook.com. You go there, look at dog pictures, you smile, and you have no idea how it works. Applications like this are being built for Bitcoin. Take GoAbra.com. It is a new app that is launching, which allows anyone to send money to anyone who is willing for remittance, everything is denominated in dollars. Behind the scenes it uses the Bitcoin network to send/receive the transaction and the user never even knows, it's not even mentioned on Abra's website. This app alone, if successful (if not them, someone will get it right) will save people sending money overseas Billions in the coming years.

This is how revolutionary Bitcoin is, it's a protocol. It's the internet of money (think about that statement for a second)

There are questions of if the Bitcoin network can scale as the economy grows around it, but I believe as long as there is a financial incentive to do so, it will scale.

Bitcoin is a harder sell in developed countries. You have a credit card and it works for you. However don't forget the 2.5Billion people that don't have a bank account.

Now with a few megabyte download they can have a bank account on their phone, and they don't have to ask for anyone's permission. That is powerful stuff.

I understand if Bitcoin is confusing, it can be confusing. It's a completely different way of approaching things. But no, it's not a scam. You can't create Bitcoins at will (it takes a lot of investment/equipment to mine Bitcoins and run the network)

Just remember, you have no idea how Facebook.com works, about the protocols running in the background to see those baby pictures.

Brilliant people are building Bitcoin apps today so you don't have to know how it works.

I won't recommend where/how to invest in Bitcoin because I don't know if that's allowed here. If anyone asks though, I'll share.

15-03-10,How to properly value a dev stage biotech.,"Analyst here. Here's how I go about valuing biotech, though, I honestly don't recommend getting involved in this sector as a retail investor. There are simply too many unknowns... 

Regardless, people tend to ask about this pretty often so I figure it's worth a post. Here goes:

When valuing any development stage biotech the most important factor to consider is risk. The potential market for a drug could be billions of dollars, but if it never gets approved that figure drops down to zero.

This is why when determining how much a biotech company is worth, it's crucial that we adjust for this risk. Particularly, we need calculate what's called Risk Adjusted Value, or RAV for the entire company pipeline. The formula for RAV looks as follows:

RAV =  Market Potential * Market Share * Likelihood of Approval (LOA)

Consider the following scenario, where Company X has four drugs in it's pipeline. We calculate the value of each drug by multiplying its market potential by its projected market share. This calculation gives us the value of each drug assuming approval.

We then adjust for risk by multiplying the value of each drug candidate by it's likelihood of approval(LOA). This gives us our risk adjusted value (RAV) for each drug, which we then add together to determine the total pipeline value of the company.

Obviously things like likelihood of approval and market share will be difficult to put a number on. As a retail investor, you're honestly probably shit out of luck unless you're willing to do a ton of research on things like historical approval rates. If you want to spend $12k  annually on a service to give you the most accurate data straight up, it's [BioMedTracker
](http://www.biomedtracker.com/) plain and simple. 

Essentially, what these guys do is look at historical approval rates broken down by drug type, disease target, etc. They then have a team of doctors who will look at the trial data and adjust LOA accordingly. They even have voting records of the people sitting on FDA panels. Really useful for catalytic events.

Drug | Market Potential ($MM) | Market Share| Portfolio Value ($MM) | LOA | RAV($MM)
---|---|----|----|----|----
A | $2,000 | 25% | $500 | 45% | $225
B| $1,000 | 25%| $250 | 34% | $85
C| $1,500 | 25% |$375 | 46% | $173
D | $5,000 | 25% | $1,250 | 9% | $118
Total Pipeline| $9,500 | N/A| $2,375 | N/A| $600 |

In this particular scenario, the pipeline of Company X has a maximum potential of $2.4 billion and an RAV of $600 million.

To find the appropriate share price, we account for cash and debt, and then divide by the total number of shares available:

Share Value = (RAV + Cash - Debt) / Shares Outstanding 

So if Company X were to have, $30 million in cash, $10 million in debt, and and 70 million shares outstanding, we would calculate share value as follows:

($600 million + $30 million - $10 million) / 70 million
= $620 million / 70 million
= $8.86
 
In this scenario the correct share value is $8.86, so we can consider Company X a buy so long as its current share price sits under that mark.

Again, I don't recommend biotech unless you're well equipped to get all the relevant information, but if you insist, at least make sure to break down the portfolio and adjust for risk.",48

15-03-09,Asked Schwab to pitch their Intelligent Portfolios in comparison to Wealthfront,"tl;dr Go with Schwab if your account is under $100K, go with Wealthfront if your account is over.

I figured Schwab would have a fact sheet they can read off to potential customers about why their product is better than Wealthfront's... sure enough they have a list of bullet points. Here's the rundown they gave me:

- No management fee with Schwab. Wealthfront charges 0.25% over a baseline that is $10K ($25K for early clients) + $5K per referral.
- Schwab ETFs have a lower expense ratio (read: fee) than the ones that Wealthfront uses. This is interesting because Wealthfront actually does buy Schwab ETFs for TLH but primarily uses Vanguard funds.
- Schwab uses a survey to calculate your asset allocation (basic, I know...)
- TLH starting at $50K. Wealthfront's TLH starts at $100K.

Based on my own observations and conversations with Wealthfront, they are further along in the the development of algorithms for TLH and rebalancing. Wealthfront also offers ""direct indexing"" which means they directly buy the individual stocks that compose an ETF, so they can rebalance and harvest losses at a much finer scale. This feature starts at $100K and improves at $500K and $1MM.

Schwab also holds a large portion of your investment in cash. Instead of having Schwab keep 20% cash and 80% bonds and equities, why not just invest only 80% of your money with Schwab. If Schwab introduces a management fee I would not want to pay them to hold cash, so something to watch out for.

So my takeaway is that Schwab's product is very basic right now, while Wealthfront can be thought of as a more efficient machine. Schwab is more accessible with TLH at $50K, while Wealthfront has more advanced financial engineering especially at $500K and up. Both business models have an element of genius: **once you enable tax-loss harvesting you cannot easily switch from one product to another without potentially incurring wash sales and their tax consequences, not to mention capital gains.**

If anyone from Schwab or Wealthfront is reading: you should eventually offer a product to aid new customers with this transition. That is provide a way to transfer assets without a taxable event from one brokerage to the other, and efficiently convert assets when it makes sense to do so (rebalancing, TLH).",80

15-03-10,"The best performing tech fund (since 2000) doesn't own Apple","From Reuters, but I chopped it up to pick out the standout parts.

The best performing technology fund since the peak of the dot-com boom did it all without owning Apple, whose soaring stock price has pushed the Nasdaq near a new record high.

The $941 million Fidelity Select IT Services fund has returned an average of 10.9 percent a year since March 10, 2000. That's more than double any other technology fund tracked by Lipper, and trounces the 0.1 percent a year generated over the same period by the PowerShares QQQ ETF.

This is a fund that doesn't have Google, doesn't have Microsoft. This is a wholly different subset of technology than most investors are familiar with.

The fund invests at least 80 percent of its assets in firms that provide day-to-day services such as payment processing and web hosting. The key is looking for companies with recurring revenue and operate in the background.

For example, couple key positions include Vantiv, a payment processing company, and data analytics company Cognizant Technology Solutions.

It's  is a very concentrated fund and while it has companies like IBM but also small and mid-cap companies that will fly below the radar for most investors.

One of the big reasons for its outperformance is its top holdings, which are Visa and Mastercard, both of which are up more than 220 percent over the last five years. Together, the companies make up about 26 percent of the fund's assets. Neither is the top holding in any other technology fund.",129

15-03-10,"As the bull fades, what will YOU be doing?","Obviously, people's situations differ and change but I'd be open to hearing thoughts on my approach and what others are doing themselves.

- My 401k. 
Not changing a thing. It's mostly a retirement date fund (2050) with 30% in a SP500 index.

- My Roth. 
I've previously been aggressive and have 100% equities (all index funds). I'll be only buying bonds this year to swing it toward 30% bonds (the age in bonds guide).

- My brokerage
I have a few big baggers (TCX, LO) that I'll probably sell to lock in their gains, I don't see them getting much higher. The bulk of my money is in SPY (spotting a trend here?) and I'm planning to keep that until technicals are callling end of the bull run. Different people have different interpretations of that but I'd say a bounceless 2 month slow slide without FED intervention is my very rough guide. After that I'd selll 75%. Holding everything else that's in the red and/or has low P/E already (PFE, BLL, GBX, HCLP, KEP). Two I'll hold because I actually think they still have plenty more growth (ACAD, SAVE) but I'll sell to lock in the good gains if the situation changes.


- My reasoning.
I'm trying to balance my long term and short term interests. In the long term (ie retirement) I don't care about this bull run ending so that's why my 401k and Roth IRA will be pretty much unchanged with only the small change of adding some bonds to the ROTH to make it less equity heavy. I'm interested in buying my first home/apartment in the next 2-3 years and where I live that means dropping 100k (20% down on a average home price, fuck you gentrification). For that reason, I'm happy to lock in some of my gains to free up some cash that I'll need.

So it goes without saying, develop a plan, don't let your emotions get the best of you, blah blah [Insert rest of beginner initiation speech]. The basics though can't be beat on enough sometimes. Mainly don't invest in things with very little knowledge or confidence.

Starting out I wanted to see if it was possible to drive up from an initial start of $1,000. Also I was using Think or Swim as my platform if anyones curious. Most of my investment experience was through just stocks as a side but over 2 years of experience as far as analysis.
So I did have a decent base.

My first tactics revolved around company trades and only BTO or STO trades. I wasn't issuing out anything because I have personal issues with using margin accounts and wasn't doing any uncovered or naked trades. Just not comfortable especially starting out. But I had decent returns over the next two weeks. I was playing a cautious strategy to test the waters and made $212 (after commission) after the two weeks was up. I'm not saying this is some get rich quick, I spent a HELL of a lot of time learning and developing my strategy. Not a great return for time invested but 20% over two weeks is better than a savings account :/

Well all was going well and my emotions got the better hold of me when I discovered SPY... and then.. their weekly options. They have great volatility and great potential to earn, but it was a different animal i wasn't ready for and things went south. The next week and a half of me being cocky and getting lost in it, my $212 was gone and my total P/L was now at -$981.....

I'm sure not to many people will read this, esepecially since i'm not advertising and trying to clickbait people. But hopefully to the lone researcher out there trying to improve his portfolio or trading psychology to be better, I hope you find this and add it as a story to remember to not let your nerves get to you. I could have easily recovered, instead I sat infront of the computer and watched to long, got emotional, sold to early even though it went up the next day.

15-03-10,My CFP professor recommended American Funds over Vanguard today. Set aside your bias and lemme know what you think.,"Background about myself: over the past few years I read a lot about Jack Bogle, index funds, and Vanguard, as what he said made a lot of sense. I eventually subscribed to what he's advocating and made indexing my investment philosophy.

Fast forward to today. So I'm just doing the first ever CFP intro course since last month, and this week's topic happened to be about investment. I had read our textbook on this topic which also advocated index funds.

I was surprised when the professor eschewed index funds. I was skeptical, but tried to remain as open-minded as possible. After all, he's a CFP who has been in the financial planning business for decades, and from what he's telling us, he's a fiduciary who looks after his clients' interests and not his own.

Below are some points from what I've written earlier in my notes, so I may be missing the full picture (some of these claims are based on research, but I don't know which studies they are):

* load funds substantially outperform no load funds -- on average, the advice provided by the advisors do a great job.

* Vanguard's actively managed funds (after fees and expenses) beat their own Vanguard index funds in the long-term (according to a study)

* Vanguard was started by Bogle, an advocate of index funds. The operating expenses incurred are a form of revenue for the company, so naturally this is why Bogle keeps advocating index funds.

* Even though Bogle advocates index funds, Vanguard also has actively managed funds with expense ratios that are sometimes much higher than other comparable actively managed funds

He said the above (and other things he mentioned that I didn't manage to write down) are ""facts"". He acknowledged that what he was about to say would be his opinion, so take it with a grain of salt ... although he said he has invested over $100m of his clients' money with American Funds. My professor almost always invests for his clients in American Funds for the long run, not short term.

I've never heard of American Funds before this, so these are a few points he mentioned about them:

* They have been around since 1934

* Their fund managers have a few decades' of experience compared to the young'uns managing other funds

* They don't advertise (which is why we, the public, may not have heard about them before), so it keeps their expense ratios low

* They only have 12 equity funds, and of all of these funds, only 1 fund didn't outperform index funds *over the long-term*. The rest did outperform index funds **even after including fees and costs** since their inception decades ago. 11 of them also perform better than the index during the two recent bear markets.

* They're supposedly ethical. Even when they receive a sudden influx of investors, they reduced fees instead of increasing them.

* They charge front load fees, yes, but you're paying for the expertise of these active fund managers.

I guess I'm also writing this to see if I can make sense of it all and see if changing investment philosophies is warranted or not. I'm interested to hear your objective opinions whether my professor is making a good case for actively managed funds—specifically his choice for American Funds—or not.

EDIT: I must clarify and say that my professor doesn't stop using Vanguard completely. He said he does use index funds when the situation calls for it.",12
15-03-09,Seeking Traditional IRA Portfolio Advice for Parents,"**TL'DR:** Parents are 60 with a small business, business property, and house with less than 2 years of mortgage. No retirement fund, but 2 years of IRA contributions. What to do with it?

**Intro:**
My parents and their generation (Dad's side) immigrated to the states in the late 70s. My parents ended up owning their own business and its property, and are about to pay off their mortgage with less than 2 years left. 

What's shocking is they don't have a solid retirement plan. The business, its property, and their house from my perspective is their nest egg. 

Any way, just only 2 years ago their personal tax preparer suggested a traditional IRA and now 2 years of contributions are sitting in the cash account. I am the one who is mostly responsible for managing this IRA but I'm not sure how to go about investing with such a small amount, and short period of time until they retire (between 6-10 years).

15-03-10,How can both these oil ETFs drop at the same time? Is this a play on oil market contango?,"How is it possible for both of these ETFs to drop at the same time?

Long:DBO, USO

Short:UCO

On another note, from what I can understand, contango refers to a situation when the market is willing to pay a higher price/bbl in a futures contract then what they expect the spot price to be in the future (likely because of storage costs or expected disruptions?).  This implies 4 things:

     1) Contango is when a specific future has decreasing value towards expiration (i.e. shorter storage, less probability of disruption)
     2) Backwardation is when a specific future has increasing value towards expiration
     3) A normal futures curve is when the price of future M &lt;  future M+1 on a given date
     4) An inverted futures curve is when s when the price of future M &gt;  future M+1 on a given date

So to make sure, we are currently have a normal futures curve with a market experiencing contango?  Shouldn't contango be the norm? 

Assuming I believe oil inventories will rise faster than capacity in the short-term, won't that cause storage rent to increase, thereby pushing the market further into contango?  Shouldn't this be a good opportunity to short ETFs that hold large amounts of crude oil futures?  If inventories grow slower then expected, the fund won't be hurt as bad.  If inventory grows at a faster rate then expected, I'll make more money.  If it grows at the expected rate, the fund will still lose money if the roll costs are higher than price growth.

Does any of this make sense?  ",8

15-03-10,Beating The Stock Market With The Golden Cross,"Millions of people try to conquer the stock market with the hope of buying the big winning stock that will boost their portfolio and allow them to get closer to a financially independent life faster. However, scientific research shows that the average investor underperforms the market by 1.5% annually.  Added to this, less than 1% of all traders can make any profits in the financial markets.  Profitable investing for most retail traders seems to be hard work, with a lot of knowledge and research required to be really successful.

But is it really true that trading the markets is difficult?

The fact is that traders really only need a handful of simple but effective strategies to make consistent income trading the markets, without necessarily having to spend time doing lots of research on the background to what is being traded.

The Most Popular Trading Tool

Moving averages are without a doubt the most commonly used trading and investing tool. The reason is that they are very straightforward and the information they provide is not subjective.  Best of all, investors don’t have to possess any specific knowledge about how financial markets work in order to read and use them.

The Golden Cross

The ‘Golden Cross’ is one of the most well-known moving average systems. The Golden Cross uses the 50 and the 200 moving average; a moving average is a line on a chart which averages out the price of fifty or two hundred previous price points on any particular time frame.  So, for instance, if you are on a Daily chart, the 50 period moving average gives you an indication of the average price at the Daily interval, based on calculations for the previous 50 days; the same goes for the 200 period moving average.  The reason that both the 50 and the 200 moving averages are significant is that they are widely used among both professional and retail traders, and even the media frequently talks about both moving averages when the meet up with price. Technical analysis often works as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The Golden Cross generates a buy signal when the 50 moving average crosses over the 200 to the upside.  At this point, price will be sitting above the 50 moving average line.   In the illustration below, the Golden Cross occurs at the price 9777; this is your signal to enter the market buying.

A trader will have to close the trade when price closes back below the 50 moving average – as you can see in the illustration below, this would have occurred at the price 13,645 where ‘Exit’ is indicated.

Table 1: Performance of the Golden Cross between 2006 and 2013

 

As the table shows, the Golden Cross system is more successful in some markets than others. It is therefore very important to test the Golden Cross system before you start applying it with your own money. Otherwise, this is a high risk endeavor and more akin to gambling rather than investing.

However, you can see that although the success rate is slightly below 50%, your annual return amounts to 8.75% across different markets and keep in mind that the financial crisis, where markets fell up to 30% in one year, falls into the observation period as well. Thus, the Golden Cross can be an investment method that could generate some decent side income for you.

 

How To Generate Extra Income Safely With Trading

If you want to learn how to trade and generate some extra income, you have to test your trading ideas with a so called ‘Demo’ account first. Every trading broker offers the possibility to open a demo account where you can trade the real markets with play-money.  Especially if you are a new to trading and investing, you should test your trading system on a demo account first before you start investing your real money. If you are new to trading, here are a few more tips on how to generate extra income without risking losing it all:

Accept that you will not win every trade
You don’t have to be right all the time to make money
Don’t trade with money you cannot afford to lose
Cut your losers early and let winners run
Adopt a long term perspective and don’t expect to get rich quick

15-03-10,$10k iWatch could mean hundreds of millions in profit for AAPL. What am I missing?,"So, $10,000 for a watch seems ridiculous, but when you break it down, you see that's it's quite ingenious for AAPL.

The casing of the watch is 18k gold, at about 1200/ounce (24k), AAPL is probably going to use about 1-1.5oz of 18k gold on the watch.  The internals of the watch should be the same as the $350 variant (HW and SW are the same).  If it follows AAPL's traditional 40-60% profit margin (iPhone 6 reportedly nearly 70%), that means the $10k watch will cost them about $1500 (if they buy gold at market price).

This means there is potentially $8500 profit in each of the high end watches (not considering some are sold for upto $17k).  Sell 10,000 watches a quarter (which is nothing considering China and India love gold and have over 2.5billion people), and that's 85 million in profit a quarter and nearly 100 million in revenue.  Sell 100,000 high end watches a year that's $850,000 million in profit and nearly a billion in revenue.  

Why would AAPL ever want to get involved with building a car, if they can sell 1 watch (which is much easier to build, design, etc than a car) and make more profit.

Is it just me, or does this high end watch really drive the price of AAPL higher?  I can see it going to 140-150 by Dec 2015.

For a long time, I've had a large chunk of my portfolio invested in OSTFX (mutual fund run by a family friend who has done very well managing my parents' money over the past several decades).

Recently, I've started thinking that it may not be the best choice of mutual fund, and I started putting new money into VTI - lower expenses ratio, performance seems good.

I'm comparing VTI to OSTFX on google finance, and VTI seems to far outperform OSTFX. Expenses are much lower too.

Is there any reason I shouldn't sell all my OSTFX and put it in a portfolio of Vanguard ETFs, probably anchored around VTI? I'm not sure if google finance factors in things like dividends, expenses, etc, but it does seem like OSTFX is lagging behind, and I know the low expense index fund is in favor these days.

15-03-11,"How to Buy &amp; Take Profits in a Cyclical Bull Market","Good morning, today let’s welcome back again Troy!

In every investment, there are 2 critical parts

An entry strategy
An exit strategy
The individual cyclical bull and cyclical bear waves are easy to identify. And the beauty is (as I mentioned in the last post), you don’t have to predict the changes between cyclical bull and cyclical bears. All you have to do is recognize these changes in the economy’s fundamentals. The market (price) lags the real fundamentals.

So what do you do once you recognize that the fundamentals are changing from cyclical bear to cyclical bull?

Entry Strategy
“Catching the falling knife” is dangerous. This means that unless you are a professional trader, do not attempt to buy more into your investment as the market falls (or, as some people call it, “buy on the dip”). Why? Because in many cases, the “dip” isn’t a dip. It’s the beginning of the mother of all avalanches.

Here’s an example. In January 2009, the U.S. economy stopped getting worse (you would be able to see that just by looking at the economic data). Thus, the market started changing from cyclical bear to cyclical bull. However, had you started buying in January 2009 (catching the falling knife), the market would have fallen another 40%. You missed the bottom by 40%! That’s a 40% loss!

Instead, what you should do is wait for the bottom to “be in”. Wait until the market has already bottomed out, and then start buying. How do you know if the “bottom is in”? Simple. Every market bottom has a couple of characteristics:

The economic fundamentals have to turn from “deteriorating” to “stop getting worse”. This is necessary for a bear market bottom, but it is not enough.
The banks should start buying securities. In January 2009, the CEO’s of major Wall Street banks (e.g. Jamie Dimon from JP Morgan) said that the economy was turning around. He would only say that if JP Morgan had already covered their shorts (bearish positions) and gone long. Once they have completely switched from short to long, you know that the bottom isn’t far.
The market needs to be in absolute panic. And by panic, I don’t just mean intensive selling (e.g. the market crashed 700 points today). I need to see media headlines that say “no one knows where the market bottom will be”. That’s what I’m looking for – absolute panic. When the average Joe has given up all hope, the bottom is very, very close.
Once the bottom is in, there should be a V shaped rally. Most strong rallies are V shaped. This is based on the simple theory of mean reversion. When the market panics (deviates from the mean), it should snap back using an equally great force.

But after every V shaped rally, there is always a retracement. This is where you want to buy. The market either retraces 50% or 61.8% of the rally. (The reason for this is unknown – it’s called the Fibonacci Retracements. Fibonacci Retracements like fibonacci numbers are just known to be valid. No one knows why the fibonacci numbers exist – they just do.)

Exit Strategy

By the end of the 4-6 year cyclical bull market, you need to initiate your exist strategy. Here’s how:

Every cyclical bull market lasts at least 4 years. So unless the market has gone up (on average) for a minimum of 4 years, don’t even consider liquidating your long positions
Increase of slope. The last wave of a bull market always involves the market increasing it’s rate of ascent. This means that if the market was previously increasing at 0.5% each day, increasing the rate of ascent (slope) would make the market increase 0.7% each day.
When the above 2 criteria are filled out, the proper way to exit a bullish long position is to scale out. No one can predict the market top (although it’s easier to predict the market bottom) – thus, it’s better to just scale out. If you sell all your holdings and the market goes up another 40%, you’ll be in a lot of pain. If you hold on to all your holdings and the market peak is already in, you’re going to sell when the market is falling.",1

15-03-11,"Gentlemen, it's time","[kapow](http://i.imgur.com/5gmkDeQ.png)

I've been watching this tumble since January.  Watching those Brent/WTI spreads climb, watching the dead cat bounce and then the predictable return to new lows, watching the Houston/Dallas banks start to merge themselves to weather the bad outstanding debt (personally...I live in TX), watching XOM and CVX get down to PEs of 10, watching people pretend to be shocked every Wednesday as inventory reports come in ever higher, watching rig counts return to 2009 levels.  

Before the dead cat bounce XLE found resistance at 70 and ERX at 45.  I made up my mind then that it was a buy in the 40s when it got back there.

There's another 500k where that came from, to be put into play when there's a 10 dollar move (either direction).  I'll try to whittle the cost basis down with covered calls a bit either way while we're volatile.  Optimally I'd like to be in the 30s on the cost basis after some well placed call sales.

This isn't a short term gamble, it's for the rest of the year, and into the latter half of next year if required.

This article is relevant for investors as well as students (probably a big part of the reddit investing subreddit) though because at over a trillion dollars, student loans have surpassed all other forms of consumer debt in the United States.

On the one hand this might allow struggling students to unburden themselves of these massive debts and get on with their lives.
On the other I have no idea what this will do to the economy, the Federal government might have to take on a whole ton of bad loans again.

If we get a major sell off, or continues series of sell of days, re-visiting the lows that 2009 saw, how do you think businesses and jobs will be affected? Now, it would probably have to be a black swan type event because as it stands right now, the market is playing the victim just with interest rates maybe going up. That in itself is not a problem. The market re-prices the stocks and bonds but life goes on and companies will figure out how to make money even if interest rates tick up.

15-03-11,Re-investing dividends and dealing with commission,"I recently put 8k into a few stocks, most of which pay dividends. With the exception of one (which yields 9.5% and pays out monthly) they all yield 3-4% and pay out quarterly.

Just for simplification sake let's say that I get 1% of 8k quarterly, which is $80. Commission is about $5. At that commission, it really doesn't seem worth it to buy more stock, but at the same time, now I've got $80 sitting there doing nothing. This is a Canadian TFSA, so if I take the $80 out and put it in a savings account or something, I can't put it back in my stock account until the next year if I max out my TFSA contribution.

My broker allows me to automatically reinvest dividends into eligible stock with no commissions, but it has to be the same stock the dividend came from. And, if the dividend return isn't enough to buy a single share, the money will sit in the account doing nothing until enough dividends accumulate to purchase a share. The average stock was priced around $50 and I bought about $1k of each, so at 1% it would take 5 quarters to be able to buy back just one stock, which means 4 quarters of money sitting in my account doing nothing.

So basically, I'm stuck between taking the total dividend returns from all stocks and investing them in only a couple stocks quarterly and eating a decent commission, auto-reinvest the dividends and have several quarters of 'dead money', or another option I haven't decided on yet.

I'm pretty new to this so I can't imagine I'm the first person to come across it... Does anyone have any suggestions?

15-03-10,The One Thing You Don’t Want To Do When Investing,"If you’ve been a reader of Sprout Wealth for long you know we like to talk about outside the box ways to growing wealth. We believe that kind of thinking is vital to really give trajectory to your wealth building efforts. That’s not to say you can’t make money without getting out of the proverbial box, just that it can really help give you a much needed boost. All that said, there is one very key area where outside the box thinking isn’t really necessary and, in some cases, can actually hurt you – and that’s investing in the stock market. If you don’t believe me, hear me out.

Thinking Outside The Box Can Cost You Money

I saw this bear true every single day when I was working as a broker. I would speak with several dozen outside the box thinkers everyday in fact. These were people who were making investing something it shouldn’t be and it only cost them money. Many times this was investing in something they didn’t understand but more often than not it all pointed back to one thing – constant and regular trading.

Don’t get me wrong, there are many good traders out there. They make a living at it, but those doing it well are far and very few in between. In fact, trading was often their day job. They spent hours at it charting individual stocks and made relatively educated decisions. That’s not to say that they would always end up in winning trades, of course, but when they won they would win big. The rub though was that describes a very small select group of traders and most others would be on the losing end of the stick to the tune of thousands, if not more, of commissions. Taken over the course of a number of years that cost can and will be detrimental to an investment portfolio. I’ve spoken to far too many who consider themselves traders to know this is true.

Investing Should Not Be “Sexy”

This is where I think many who trade too actively trip themselves up. Their perspective is off. They view investing in the stock market as relatively equivalent to gambling (which is a debate for another day) and treat it as such. They go whale hunting looking for those massive wins only to see that it’s costing them tens of thousands of dollars…at best.

Not only that, but they also lose sight of how those losses will impact them 10 or 20 years down the road and continue down the path of racking up loss after loss trying to recoup what they’ve lost. Again, this is all about perspective being off. They try to make investing something it shouldn’t be by trying to make it sexy, and only end up hurting themselves in the long run.

What Sexy Investing Really Is

As we start out this New Year you likely have a goal or resolution that goes back to money and growing it. When you start to apply that to investing, please do yourself a favor and remember that your future self is depending on you now. That said, don’t turn investing into something that it shouldn’t be. Instead, remember that slow and steady wins the race.

If you look at my thoughts on the best investing books for beginners, you’ll see that they all go back to the same theme. They promote staying with the market and looking for ways to cut fees. The question then comes as to what that looks like. Most often that points back to investing in broad based index funds and solid dividend paying stocks that help you stay with the market. Then, you just rinse and repeat over the stages of your investing life, adjusting as your situations change.

I know it’s not sexy. I know it may not be exciting. But, investing really shouldn’t be and if it’s good enough for Warren Buffett, then I think it’s good enough for the rest of us. ;-)

15-03-10,Bernard Baruch’s 10 Rules of Investing,"By his mid-twenties, Bernard Baruch was able to buy an $18,000 seat on the exchange with his winnings and commissions from being a broker. By age 30, he is a millionaire. In his two-volume 1957 memoirs, My Own Story, Baruch left us with the following timeless rules for playing the game:

“Being so skeptical about the usefulness of advice, I have been reluctant to lay down any ‘rules’ or guidelines on how to invest or speculate wisely. Still, there are a number of things I have learned from my own experience which might be worth listing for those who are able to muster the necessary self-discipline:”

1. Don’t speculate unless you can make it a full-time job.

2. Beware of barbers, beauticians, waiters — of anyone — bringing gifts of “inside” information or “tips.”

3. Before you buy a security, find out everything you can about the company, its management and 
competitors, its earnings and possibilities for growth.

4. Don’t try to buy at the bottom and sell at the top. This can’t be done — except by liars.

5. Learn how to take your losses quickly and cleanly. Don’t expect to be right all the time. If you have made a mistake, cut your losses as quickly as possible.

6. Don’t buy too many different securities. Better have only a few investments which can be watched.

7. Make a periodic reappraisal of all your investments to see whether changing developments have altered 
their prospects.

8. Study your tax position to know when you can sell to greatest advantage.

9. Always keep a good part of your capital in a cash reserve. Never invest all your funds.

10. Don’t try to be a jack of all investments. Stick to the field you know best.

I do not own any stocks right now. I can’t find anything I like. I do have an idea that makes a lot of sense to me.

I think if Coca-Cola wants to invest in the coffee industry, that they should buy Starbucks. It makes all the sense in the world, while letting Howard Schultz run the combined company. Coke has a huge problem and that is soda is the new cigarettes. They are scrambling to find something new. The guy who runs Coke to me is a fool and has made one mistake after another. If you want to be in coffee, Starbucks is your answer. Howard Schultz may have a huge ego, but the guy is a winner and is the only guy with the drive to really turn Coke around. It would be an end to end beverage company. So if I was an investment banker, I would push Coke to do this. Just my 2 cents",0

https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tiingo-investing-how-to-create/id972388816?mt=2&amp;uo=4

(Non-itunes)

http://tiingo.com/podcasts

Every so often a friend would come up to me and ask, ""Yo Rishi, I got $xx,xxx - how can I invest it?"" To those of us who've been in that situation, what do you say in 30 minutes? The safest thing for me is to say nothing because I don't want to be liable for anything :)

Anyway, 6 years later after the first time somebody asked me this question, I decided to do something about it :p

I launched a podcast series that is meant to take the total newb to a professional status. The goal was to start what ""what is a stock"" and then get to portfolio construction and hedge fund strategies. I originally scripted it for my friends, but it became a hit on iTunes and became one of their featured podcasts...in a couple days. I was not expecting that type of reaction and I am super thrilled.

At this point, I am very excited and want to share it with as many people as possible. I wasn't expecting this type of reception so I hope it will help some of you all:

Please let me know any of your feedback! I apologize if the audio quality is in/out - it's my first time recording anything let alone posting it to the world. I'm figuring out the kinks. 

P.S.
Right now the episodes are geared more toward the novice given I'm just starting the series; but, for the more advanced investors among us - try episode 4 (pilot) on correlation and beta. I used to be a correlation derivatives trader (yes you can trade correlation) so it's a fun topic for me. I speak on it from the perspective of creating a portfolio, not on trading though. 

Thanks so much everyone. I'm really excited for how this is turning out.

EDIT: Let me know if there are any topics you want me to speak more about. A few friends recc'd roboadvisors, which seems to be a big topic here especially after Schwab's release.",22

15-03-11,Does the low volatility premium still exist in in a multiple-market portfolio with regular rebalancing?,"Let me justify that question with some explanation. Also, forgive me if this belongs in one of the weekly threads, but I thought there could be an interesting discussion to be had here.

There's [academic research](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Low_volatility_index_returns) showing that, over some long time periods studied, low volatility investments have roughly a 2% better return on average. However, the studies that I'm aware of don't consider any investment strategies more complex than ""just leave a lump sum of cash in one market for 30 years,"" which makes these studies potentially irrelevant when real-world investment strategies are a lot more nuanced.

It seems to me that, while volatility can evidently cost you 2% per year on its own, a portfolio with allocations in uncorrelated markets and regular rebalancing stands to gain from volatility in the long run. If one of your highly volatile investments jumps in value, that gives you the opportunity to sell part of it and buy some more affordable stock elsewhere. If one of your investments tanks, then you can sell off a portion of your other investments and then pick up more at a steep discount. However, if you're holding low-volatility investments, you'll see less relative movement between your holdings, which shrinks the possible gains that can be had through rebalancing.

Does the ""low volatility premium"" still exist in these conditions? Any thoughts?",9
15-03-11,Any thoughts on gold companies like AU/AG?,"Price has dropped dramatically in the past few weeks due to the price of gold falling below the 1200 support, but do you guys feel like this is a small dip because we've already found bottom or that gold/silver still has a long way to go further down before the price rebounds?

I bought my positions in gold and silver back in January, I've been continually buying more shares as the price was falling lower and lower due to the belief that prices would rebound by October. I have unloaded tens of thousands in capital into the two and been selling covered calls for my positions, so I may have been a bit over my head. 

I have not come across any data to convince me that gold should keep falling.... The dollar is trading at an all time high and I am convinced that it is close to reaching its peak in May before going into a corrective state, but at the same time, I'm thinking of liquidating some of the positions (1/2) I bought to move over to further my exposure to oil in the coming 2 months because I feel like there is more upside. I don't know how much longer the market can pound on gold, but I just have a feeling it's not going to end in the coming month. Has anyone else been monitoring precious metals? 

I try to never sell at a loss, but when I feel like the direction is headed further downward short-term and I see an opportunity to make money instead of lose it, I get put into these rare awkward situations... I am most likely going to sell and move unless someone here can show me some data to indicate gold being a better hold versus shorting oil in the coming month. ",1

Disney's theme parks have and will always do well.  Their expansion of the Marvel universe via movies, tv and merchandise will continue to generate revenue.  Lets not forget what the Star Wars franchise is going to mean for them moving forward.

Terms like efficient frontier, Black-Litterman model, utility curve, Brownian motion price analysis and stochastical price equilibrium (just to name a few) puzzle clients and leave them with no choice but entrust their savings to wealth managers who may or may not be savvy enough to grow invested capital.

I have a great job in the medical field that pays a little over six figures. My wife works as an attorney so combined we do pretty well. We own our house and still have 25 years left on the mortgage. I became interested in trading options a few years ago. My first go at it I started with $2500 in January and by December I had $100,000. I guess greed got to me and I saw dollar signs and made some moves that were too risky and within a month...poof it was all gone. I felt like I still had an edge and that I was good at finding undervalued contracts and undervalued companies. I wanted to invest in myself and give it another go. So I plunked down $15,000 around Feb 2014. By December I had close to $250,000. I would say I made about 300 trades in that time span. The same thing just happened again, somehow in the span of two months I lost it all again on contracts that I didn't even think were too risky! I have learned a ton throughout this whole process but losing that amount of money hurts, and it hurts bad. Even though we are just the same financially it hurt my ego maybe even the worst. I really felt like I was good at this, but the same scenario, two years in a row? Maybe I just got really lucky.

15-03-12,Maybe there should be a place for leveraged ETFs in your portfolio,"...ok, before you chop my head off, hear me out. There are some self-evident truths this sub holds.

1. Warren Buffet is a great investor. His investment advice is generally correct. 
* His advice is to invest in the stock market because despite its volatility, the stock market will rise over time.

2. Index and ETF investing is appropriate for many lay investors. This is also Buffet's advice so this is doubly true.

3. Compound interest is the holy grail of investing. Buffet says this. Even fucking Einstein apparently believed this. This self-evident truth's truthiness is therefore compounded!

If you believe these truths, an instrument which combines all these things should make you super duper happy. Such an instrument exists but for some reason, our sub hates it. I'm talking about 3x leveraged daily move tracking ETFs.

So, I tried to figure out a good, math based reason to hate UDOW and SDOW. Not only did I want to hate leveraged ETFs but also rattle off numbers to justify that hate in the off chance that I'd get invited to a party and happened to talk to someone who understood investing.

**Here is what I found:**

Leveraged ETFs are good as in they are not bad. Lay investors can hold it for long periods of time and not immediately go up in smoke. 

**Assumptions:**

1. Market behavior from 1985-2015 is fairly representative of how the market behaves overall.

2. DJIA of 1985 is largely behaviorally similar to the DJIA of today even if they are compositionally different. 

**Definitions:**

UDOW(3x) and SDOW(-3x) are leveraged ETFs which track daily percent changes in the DJIA. A -1% change in DJIA will be reflected as a 3% fall in $UDOW and a 3% rise in $SDOW. Their management fees is 0.95%.

**Methodology:**

1. I picked my time period for back testing as 1/1/1985 to 3/6/2015. This covered some pretty drastic swings in the market like the 1987 black monday, dot com bust, 9/11, and sub prime crisis.

2. I invested $100 in UDOW and $100 in SDOW on 1/1/1985. 

3. I downloaded DJIA closing prices from 1/1/1985 to 3/6/2015 and applied 3x daily change to the previous day's UDOW and SDOW closing price. So 
    UDOW(t) = UDOW(t-1) * (1+ 3*(daily change)/100)
    SDOW(t) = SDOW(t-1) * (1+ 3*(daily change)/100)

4. I plotted the combined price of UDOW and SDOW on a graph [here.](https://imgur.com/ameYrNv). As you can see, $200 invested in 1/1/1985 ballooned to nearly $2500 on 1/1/2000. You could've gotten 12.5x returns for being in the market for 15 years. The lowest it fell to was roughly $50 right after Black Monday.

If you had bought $DIA on 1/1/1985 (~1300) and kept it until 1/1/2000 (~11500), you would have made 7.8x.

**Conclusion:**

If you can afford to set aside a small amount of money whose loss won't bother you, can be patient, and are willing to get out of a winning hand once you have made enough, leveraged ETFs may not be such a bad thing.",3

15-03-12,"Is Adam Nash's analysis of Charles Schwab's fees correct?","Adam Nash has an interesting post up on Medium regarding Schwab's intelligent portfolio. It highlights the fact that, while Shcwab is touts themselves as free (like WiseBanyan), they are earning a spread on cash. This is because while they will pay essentially nothing (0.12% on cash), they, as a broker dealer, will earn money on cash. This is something that all brokers and banks do. 

What is questionable is the way that Nash calculates that this will impact a portfolio. He starts with the basic idea that a young person investing at a 6% annual investment growth rate and a contribution of 10% of his salary of $65,000 - which will grow at 3% per year - will be have a total investment portfolio of $1.743 M after 40 years. My calculation is that this is that the value should be $1.624M if the 10% of salary contribution comes at the end of each year or $1.712M if the 10% of salary contribution comes at the beginning of each year. Perhaps he is compounding annually, but it still feels off.

More importantly, he says that allocating 6% to cash will cause the investor to have $138K less at the end of those 40 years. To arrive at the same conclusion (or the same ballpark, as I think that his numbers are off to begin with), I have to model that the cash portion, the 6% of the portfolio, is growing at just 0.12% per year. This results in a blended return of 5.68%.

There are two fundamental flaws with this:

1) It implies that interest rates will remain constant at next to nothing over the next 40 years. As interest rates are at historic lows, this is highly unlikely (not that I am betting interest rates rising, but historically, interest rates are dramatically higher).

2) It implies that the 6% is taken directly out of a portfolio that is yielding 6%. This may not be the case. What if it is taken out of a short term position that is yielding just 0.5%? I find it hard to imagine that, in the Schwab portfolio, the 6% that is in cash, is a substitute for the entire blended portfolio. More than likely, it is a substitution for a ""cash like"" portion of the portfolio. Even WiseBanyan and Wealthfront use ETF's that have very low yields as low risk diversifiers. If Schwab uses cash instead of low yield ETF's for low risk diversifies, the analysis by Nash is pretty misleading.

Has anybody else run the numbers? Do they match mine? Thoughts?

I have been the victim of verbal abuse, ranging from being called an idiot to being called an ""insufferable cunt"". I have been sexualized and asked to post pictures of my breasts as repayment for making people read through my posts. If we were physically together in a building I would fear for my virginity.

All the current investment instruments are only beneficial to people with lots of money: hedge fund, venture capital, etc.

For small investors, we can only shoot for long term. But how long does it take to grow $5000 to $50,000? Some traders on virtual trading earn 100-1000%. Why can't we invest in them? Sure, the chance of loosing all that money is pretty high but I think it would be worth it than waiting 20-30 years for it to grow in $50,000 (if that ever happen at all)

For traders, if they can set up a portfolio for themselves to make money out of their skill, it would be great too. I would imagine there are tons of people with very little of money but willing to take the chance.

15-03-11,Is Google innovative? Should its track record inspire confidence in a lay investor?,"Premise: Google is innovative. 

Subtext: investing in innovation will lead to outsized rewards in the future.

Supporting arguments: driverless cars, Google Fiber?, dominant mobile market share...

Counterpoints: 
1. Driverless cars - the Wiki page for driverless cars says institutions like CMU and Mercedes Benz have been working in this space for decades. Google is merely a very visible proponent of such cars.

2. Google Fiber: hardly innovative. Wireless providers like VZ have fiber optics. Maybe Google enjoys a halo because companies like VZ have not been sufficiently customer friendly. It takes one visionary CEO to realize the goldmine they are sitting on. 

3. Android: this product is the opposite of innovative. In fact, when the iPhone was launched in 2007, the founder of Android took his product back to the drawing board because he felt that the iPhone had fundamentally changed the entire mobile phone market. Ever since, Android has been playing catch up. They introduced NFC but no one cared. Apple Pay comes out and immediately eats Google Wallet's lunch. Now, once again, Google is trying to stay relevant in the mobile payments market by paying attention to Google Wallet.

4. Wearables: Google Glass flopped. On the contrary, Microsoft's Band came out to rave reviews. 

Google isn't competitive in social, nor in e-commerce, not in mass Internet, not in moonshots like driverless cars - a tesla or Apple driverless car will likely be more interesting than a Google driverless car, not in wearables. Question is, why is Google even treated like a long term investment by this sub?

Even in search, their marketshare will be eroded by the likes of FB's own search engine and AI like Watson. I test drove Yahoo's search on my iPhone after Apple switched to it from Bing - after the first week, I barely notice the difference in search result quality.

Is that a correct interpretation, or is the market in these puts just acting ""irrational""? I guess I'm just confused since USO is down today but these near-the-money puts went down too.

USO down .18 today, trading around 17.59

17.00  P Jan2017 down .13, trading at 2.82 (for some reason schwab tells me today's volume is N/A. Sometimes a hundred of these contracts trade a day and sometimes just a handful.) ",8

15-03-11,Palo Alto Networks ($PANW): Overpriced and bloated,"Even though Palo Alto Networks are rapidly growing revenue (+50% YoY revenue growth), their sales yield remains weak at 6.48% (for perspective, the average in the market hovers around 50%), they trade at an inflated 22.3 times book value and 116 times free cash flow. Weak ROA -21.7% and ROE -65.5%, are good indicators of why the short float sits at 4.72%. With insiders selling off 16% of their stake in the company over the last 6 months, it appears that even management recognizes that this price is unsustainable. The only thing that this company has going for it is the hype that's caused the stock to rise 77% over the last 12 months and 53% over the last 6. Advise to stay away, but would love to hear a counter argument.",3
15-03-12,Why do companies issue dividends instead of just buying back stock?,"The total return for the investor is the same in either case. So wouldn't it be more convenient for the investor to have the stock just increase in price instead of issuing dividends? As an investor I personally find dividends inconvenient because:

* Dividends are taxed as ordinary income, which is a higher rate than long term capital gains.  
* It makes it more difficult to calculate the total return of my investments. Google Finance only gives % changes in raw price without counting reinvested dividends.  
* It is inconvenient to reinvest dividends. Even if done automatically through my brokerage account, it still generates a lot of extraneous transaction and tax lots.

The only advantage I can see of dividends is if you want to liquidate your portfolio on the exact same schedule as the dividends, and the magnitude of the dividends just equals your desired amount to liquidate. This seems *highly* improbable though, and the benefit is still very small.

Could it be **marketing bias**? People like the sound of ""dividends"", so companies issue dividends to gain popularity and look attractive to naive investors?

Edit: I did some more research on this marketing bias. From [this article](http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0812/how-to-live-off-your-dividends.aspx):

&gt; But what if there was another way to get that four or more percent from your portfolio each year, **without selling shares and reducing principal**?

&gt; One way to enhance your retirement income is to invest in **dividend** paying stocks and mutual funds.

Here they are trying to create the image that holding dividend-paying stocks are somehow a free lunch. They ellide over the fact that when a stock issues a dividend, the share price falls by the amount of the dividend. So either way, you are ""reducing principal.""

I can't believe this myth keeps getting repeated. I guess enough naive investors believe the dividend myth that companies issue dividends just to look attractive?",2
15-03-12,Algorithmic Technical Traders - How do you define market trend,"First post in reddit :)  

I am interested in being a swing technical trader. Most (if not all) algorithms out there tells you that the precondition to certain patterns is the market trend. Unfortunately, these as published in many of trading books are super vague in telling you how to determine trend. So, would love to hear from everyone how you define your trend definition?

I've seen - if the price is above EMA(10) then it is bullish and below is bearish. Issue with this is it only tells you that market is bull/bear but what about the third valid state - trading range.

Thanks for any insight!

15-03-12,Me and my friend are trying to make a program that can be used for technical analysis of stocks and need help coming up with ideas.,"To start off, this post is not to discuss anything having to do with code only different forms of technical analysis and how to perform the analysis itself.

As I stated in the title, we are going to write a program that will allow us to do out own technical analysis of stocks. We are doing in hopes of learning more about the technical side of investing and for fun. Plus at out level we don't want to pay for a professional technical analysis program.

A few of the concepts we hope to include in our program are:
-trend line analysis (obviously)
-risk/beta
-various ratios such as PE (and a way to compare said ratios)
-Channels
-Support/resistance
-Correlation/Sensitivity

We've thrown around a few other ideas and I know there are a lot more out there, so we are just trying to get together a list of everything we should try to include.

So if you have a technical analysis program yourself or are savvy with technical analysis overall, what are some of the types of analysis that could be included in our program? And what math/computation would be involved to perform the analysis?
Feel free to post links to sites that you know of that explain the math behind a particular analysis.

15-03-12,How much equity to give up.,"Me and my better half have a small property management business. One of our clients whose properties we manage, offered us to invest in a serviced office business and we would run it. He owns a whole floor in a prime location office building (10,000 sqft) rented to a single customer and the contract will expire soon. The idea is to divide it into small fully serviced offices and rent it to different companies.

He is 77 years old, retired, distant family, on a wheel chair because of a back condition and without us it would be hard for him to make it happen, while we have a lot of experience running a similar operation. Realistically, he will not do any work and only provide the initial investment. His initial offer was, 100% of the money for the first year and we split 50/50 the equity of the newly made company, while still paying below market rates rent to him for the space.

After 3 months of brainstorming, business planning, negotiating with contractors (architect, interior designer, interior construction and detailing , internet etc ) we are ready to begin work.
Now he is asking for ""some amount of money from us towards the initial investment to show our commitment"". We wanted to know what is his exact proposal, thinking he will give up equity in return of our ""commitment"", but he will not agree on anything less than 50%.

My first questions is, what are you thoughts on his request?

My second question is, considering we initially agreed on 50/50 and now there will be no equity redistribution even if we put an investment, how much % of the total investment we should give. If we give money and there is no equity redistrubution, in a way he is asking us to give up equity. Still, the business is sound and we strongly believe in it's success, and we are willing to put money, but can't decide what is the least % to invest that wouldn't be insulting to him. 

The reason he gave us for this request, is because he sees we are busy with our main business and wants a tangible commitment from our side. We understand his side, but there is no way to predict or promise how much time we will put on each business. Maybe he sees this as conflict of interest in a way, but there is no way we will stop our business solely to run the serviced offices. At least, not in the near future.",14

15-03-12,Alternatives to Vanguard,"I have had a very bad experience trying to open an account with Vanguard.     I had opened up an account this past weekend and purchased a few of their Mutual Funds.  I had noticed there was some sort of problem with my bank transfer because I didn't see the money leave my bank.  Everything looked fine with the order according to my Vanguard login.  So I called and was informed there was a problem with the bank information that my trade was canceled and I can't place another order or correct any issues with my bank information.   Vanguard has put me in some sort of time out where I can't make any investments or fix the bank information until they call me some time next week.     They didn't notify me of a problem, they canceled my order instead of allowing me to fix the problem and they are punishing me over some issue with the bank transfer.   It's like they are bending over backwards to say I am not welcome as a new customer. This raises some serious red flags in my mind.  The problem is I don't know an alternative with as solid a reputation for low expense rates and good performances.  Any suggestions?",0

15-03-13,How are you managing your emergency fund?,"I'd be curious to get your thoughts on managing your emergency fund (if you have one). I'm currently splitting it into 3 months and investing in 3-month brokered CDs once per month. While it's not MUCH return, it's better rates than I had with any money market account. I'm thinking of stretching this out to 6 months or maybe even a year, with the obvious trade-off of higher returns for less liquidity.

Is there a better way to approach this? I think that on paper it makes sense to spread it as thin as you can (if you have N months expenses saved up, split it N times so you get it delivered to you in $XXX/N increments for n months). But would be happy to hear that I'm missing out here and there's a better way to manage it.",5
15-03-12,"Why did Intel's announcement so heavily affect Microsoft's share price today?","Somewhat of a noob question I suppose, but I'm just looking to learn something. I understand that both Intel and Microsoft they're both in the PC business, and Intel basically came out today and said that slow sales in the business sector will hurt its revenue this quarter. Microsoft is not in the PC sales business though, they're in the software business. Even if business PC sales are slow, these businesses are still using Microsoft software, whether they buy a new machine or not. 

Outside of the business-only sector, Microsoft has the launch of Windows 10 coming up, which so far looks to be very promising for 2 reasons: firstly, reviews of the Windows 10 test build are very positive, and secondly, Windows 7 and 8 users receive the upgrade to 10 for free. While this will cut down on revenue earned from selling licenses, it will significantly speed up the rate of adoption of the OS. Microsoft's Xbox division is still going strong, and they will undoubtedly continue to ship more units and games in that sector.

I guess what I'm saying is that I understand why Intel's announcement affects Microsoft to a certain degree, but I don't understand why it had as large of an effect as it did. Between the upcoming launch of Windows 10 which looks to be solid for reasons previously explained (there's a history of every 2nd OS they release being a hit), and the success of the other sectors they're in (like gaming), Microsoft seems like a solid enough company to not be so heavily affected by an announcement from Intel. Where am I wrong?  ",15

15-03-12,Need help understanding the Income Statement of a BDC (PSEC for example),"I understand basic Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flows, but I was looking over PSEC and it's really thrown me for a loop.  
  
http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PSEC/financials/income/quarter  
   
I was wondering if anyone could answer a few questions.  
  
1. Why does the link I provided above show different intermediary information than the one on Tradeking even though they end up at the same overall income? Are they not both pulling from the same quarterly filings? I have also looked at the quarterly findings and have had difficulty lining up the information to that displayed on TradeKing and Marketwatch.

2. You'll see that a good portion of PSECs earnings come from Interest Income however that doesn't seem to be reflected on the Gross Income.  
For Q2 2015 they posted Interest Income of 191m, Net Revenue of 66m, and COGS of 57m and then show the Gross Income as Net Revenue - COGS at 9m. Where does the Interest Income come back into this?
  
3. Why are their total operating expenses negative? They have an other operating expense at -126m and a general expense at 6m and that suddenly becomes a total operating expense of -20m.
  
4. How are they arriving at 86m for net income? They have -20m total operating expense, 42m interest expense, 9m gross income, 191m interest income, and somehow this becomes 86m? What am I missing?  
  
I just realized I used the TradeKing data for all these questions, but linked the markwatch data. They are fairly close and they both end on the same 86m. I'm confused by both of them. I know I must be missing something or they have some sort of income or expense that isn't listed but I'm not sure how to find it.",14

15-03-13,"[STEV] The micro-cap supplying Coke &amp; Pepsi with Stevia. My DD notes inside.","In 2012, I began following a development stage company called Stevia Corp. (OTCQB: STEV). Since then, the company has produced YOY revenue growth (with another 50% harvest increase for the Q4 that ends March 31, 2015).

They are a farm management company that primarily grows stevia, the natural alternative sweetener that they then sell to PureCircle, who refines and sells it to Coca-Cola and Pepsi for their new colas (Coke Life and Pepsi True).

In 2014, they began producing revenues from their aquaculture operations, fish farms that are fed using stevia extracts and byproducts, which they use to supply Darden Restaurants and Red Lobster.

In 2014, they also announced that they would begin development on a US bulk hemp subsidiary called Real Hemp LLC, and they have since announced that they are leveraging their extraction experience and processes to extract cannabidiol (CBD) from hemp. They have filed several patents for over-the-counter combination painkiller &amp; CBD medications, as well as a new delivery system for the medications. Hopes are revenues from these operations will materialize in late 2015 or early 2016.

The company became profitable last year and it's now a matter of scaling operations before investors see substantial revenues. It is a micro-cap company, so there is substantial risk of failure, but the company is already producing revenues and seems to have a competent (of not small) management team.

15-03-13,How are Currencies Traded?,"In the last post I discussed the very basics of currency trading. In this post, we’re going to look at the more specifics of currency trading. How exactly are currencies traded? Are currency traders making short term or long term bets? What trading strategies do they typically use?

Currencies Involve Leverage
First of all, currency fluctuations, on their own, are very, very small.

For example, year-to-date (from the beginning of 2013 until now) the Euro has advanced a mere 3%! That’s ridiculously small! 3% is chicken scratch, much less than the 25% that the U.S. stock market has generated this year (assuming you’re looking at the S&amp;P500).

Thus, in order to make a decent amount of money, currency traders must employ a ton of leverage (borrowed money). As you probably know, leverage increases your potential returns but also you’re risk.

The standard amount of leverage that currency traders employ is 10x. That means for every $1 you have, you will borrow $9, thereby multiplying your total position size by 10 times. Thus, a mere 3% gain, multiplied by 10, becomes 30%. Of course, if you lose 3%, 10x leverage will increase your losses to 30%. But because fluctuations are so small in the currency market, currency traders have no choice but to use leverage.

Currency Traders are Short Term Traders, which does not include “buy and hold”.
Take a look at the chart below:

The chart above is the 1 year chart for Euro:USD. As you can see, the individual fluctuations are small: usually no more than 6 cents up or 6 cents down. However, coupled with a 10x leverage, that 6 cents soon turns into a 60 cent gain or loss (6×10 = 60). 60 cents is equivalent to a 50% fluctuation.

Because currencies tend to fluctuate within a range, all currency traders are making short term bets. These short term bets can range from a mere hours to weeks, but no more. Thus, currency trading is definitely not for a long term investor, because there are no long term profits (as mentioned, Euro from year-to-date has increased a mere 3 cents)!

If the Euro:USD falls 3 cents, then rises 3 cents, then falls 3 cents, then rises 3 cents, the long term investor just made a grand total of $0! However, a currency trader who tries to catch each short term movement would have made a ton of money.

Currencies Involve Big Fundamentals
The currency market is arguably the market that most involves the fundamentals of an entire nation. Whereas a huge part of the stock market is about small fundamentals (eg are the companies revenues increasing? Are costs decreasing?), currencies are mainly affected by national fundamentals (eg how is America’s balance of trade? How is Europe’s economy doing as a whole?).

That is one of the things that got me attracted to currencies in the first place. I’ve always been a social science kind of guy – I love to understand how the world works.

Thus, although currencies typically swing within a range, there are general trends. For example, the Euro has been generally increasing in value this year although it has had some pretty big swings. These general trends are always caused by fundamentals. Compared to 2012, the economic situation in Europe has improved drastically (hurray for green shoots!). That’s why the Euro has been generally appreciating relative to the USD this year.

So if you do intend on trading currencies, always make sure you know what the fundamentals of a nation (or in Europe’s case, a federation) are. Is the country’s economy improving or getting worse?

Currency Traders also Invest in Commodities
On a last note (this will lead into my next post), a lot of currency traders also invest in commodities. Why? Because the value of a currency will affect the value of commodities (eg oil, gold, silver, wheat, corn, copper). All commodities are listed globally in U.S. dollars (again, because of the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement). Commodities are physical assets. If inflation hits, the value of the USD will go down, while the nominal value (in USD) of commodities (e.g. oil) will go up.

That’s why all those who invest in commodities generally pay attention to currencies (that’s me!), and all those who trade currencies will also invest in commodities.",1

The stocks are in insurance companies and Australia was hit by two natural disasters in the last Quarter, however long term I am not worried but I do want to sell these to purchase stocks in other companies. So there is a lesson I have learnt from this and this is setting a price floor to sell the stock at.

So my question is, how do you go about determining what your ""floor"" is for selling held stock? The shares purchased were SUN at $14.35 &amp; IAG at $6.26 back in August 2014. In hindsight I should of set a floor at $14/$6 respectively (no reason - just next dollar) to sell.

15-03-14,"U.S. Energy producers ready for new wave of oil (from WSJ) - thoughts on oil? long &amp; short term?","The ocean of oil from U.S. shale drove crude prices back toward six-year lows Friday, and American energy companies say they are poised to unleash a further flood that would keep prices from returning to lofty levels for a long time.


The International Energy Agency reinforced the prospect of a prolonged slump in energy prices Friday, saying U.S. oil output was surprisingly strong in February and rapidly filling all available storage tanks. The Paris-based energy watchdog said this could lead to another sharp drop in crude prices, which fell by about 50% late last year.


The report sent oil prices tumbling around the world, with the global benchmark Brent crude falling $2.41 to $54.67 a barrel. The U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate lost $2.21 to settle at $44.84, less than 40 cents above a six-year low it reached in late January. Last summer, both traded well above $100.
It was only last month that the IEA said a price recovery seemed inevitable because the U.S. production boom was likely to cool. Instead, “U.S. supply so far shows precious little sign of slowing down,” the agency said Friday. “Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations.”


Independent shale-oil producers have slashed their planned 2015 spending on drilling by $50 billion, compared with last year’s, but have promised to increase production by focusing on their best oil fields. Total U.S. crude oil production hit a high of 9.4 million barrels a day in the week ended March 6, according to federal data.
Now many are adopting a new strategy that will allow them to pump even more crude as soon as oil prices begin to rise. They are drilling wells but holding off on hydraulic fracturing, or forcing in water and chemicals to free oil from shale formations. The delay in the start of fracking lets companies store oil in the ground in a way that enables them to tap it unusually quickly if they wish—and flood the market again.


This strategy could put a cap on how high oil prices can rise once they are recovering, said Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup Inc.


“We’re in slightly unexplored territory,” Mr. Morse said. “It’s an experiment—a big, big experiment.”
EOG Resources Inc., an oil producer based in Texas, is drilling about 285 wells that it won’t start finishing off until crude oil’s price rebounds to between $60 and $65 a barrel.


“When oil prices recover, EOG will be prepared to resume strong double-digit oil growth,” Chief Executive Bill Thomas said recently.


Some other big names in U.S. energy also are delaying well completions, among them Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Apache Corp., Chesapeake Energy Corp. and Continental Resources Inc. These four plus EOG pumped 312 million barrels of oil in the U.S. in 2014, or almost 10% of American crude production.


The number of wells in Texas and North Dakota that have been drilled but aren’t yet pumping is at least 3,000, RBC Capital Markets estimates. That oil still in the ground “provides a war chest that could temper fundamental price spikes in the coming year,” RBC analyst Scott Hanold wrote in a Friday note.


This essentially is more U.S. crude in storage, akin to that in the tanks now brimming. The U.S. has 449 million barrels of oil sloshing around in tanks, the highest level on record and almost 70% of capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.


Even so, Jim Krane, an energy fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, questioned whether U.S. producers would be able to adjust oil production as quickly as, for instance, Saudi Arabia has proved able to do in the past. “We’ll probably have more price volatility because even as nimble as shale is, it’s not as nimble as OPEC,” he said. The shale producers “can’t just go out and turn a valve.”


It isn’t as though the price plunge hasn’t affected production.


The number of oil rigs drilling in the U.S. declined by 56 this week to 866, a 46% drop since early October when oil was traded for about $90 a barrel, according to oilfield-service company Baker Hughes Inc. Some production cutbacks are starting to materialize.


North Dakota regulators said Thursday the state’s oil output declined 3% in January from the record level reached in December.

Market observers have been waiting for U.S. shale production to cool down since November, when Saudi Arabia said it would keep pumping oil at high levels to preserve its own customer base. Some members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said at the time that the move would force American producers to cut pumping because their oil is relatively expensive to produce.


U.S. companies aren’t necessarily looking to fill OPEC’s shoes as the so-called swing producer that can adjust production to help set price levels.


For many, delaying oil production from drilled wells is a financial decision; finishing off a well and putting it into service accounts for 60% of the well’s total price.


By pushing off that expense, companies hope they can earn more from higher oil prices once they finally do pump and sell their crude. They also are expecting their costs will fall as oilfield-service providers vie for their business.


Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources Inc., a producer in North Dakota, has urged peers to hold off on completing as many wells as possible.


Continental is waiting to hook up 127 already-drilled wells, postponing up to $1 million in spending apiece.
“Save that money,” Mr. Hamm said recently.


“Avoid selling that production in this poor market and wait for service costs to fall before completing those wells. Most people are doing that,” he said.

Any money I put into my savings account is fairly minimal, and seems gets inflated at the same rate I am able put into it.

I've started investing in bitcoin for reasons ideological as they are financial, but I realize it has at least as much risk as it does potential reward.

My question is this... Can I buy very small quantities, or would I be shooting myself in the foot?
Minimum I would be able to buy at a time would be 100$ worth, maximum 500$ worth, but it would take me 3-6 months to acquire that much in free savings.

We'll then look to connect so I can pay you a percentage in return. Personally, I like to pay back people that have helped me not only because it's right but because I also believe in karma (and I'm also a bit of a hippy at heart; love, peace and all that bullshit).

So the reason I'm here and posting this, I'm completely new to this all and seriously looking for advice as it was never there for me growing up. I've recently (better late then never I guess) stared a Roth IRA, E trade account with a starting deposit of $700. Out of the $700 I've purchased 5 shares of Apple and now have $71 left just sitting there.

Why the Apple stocks? Long story but it goes back to when Apple was selling for $14 a share and I didn't even have that to invest in it. I had just switched from PC to Mac and the system (G3) and OS at the time blew me away. Simply because of that alone, I was telling everyone I knew to invest in Apple as I felt it was going to go far as a company but not a single person took me seriously as I was just a kid who was into art and surfing and had spiky hair. Moving on many of years later I've been feeling left out as I kept seeing the stock climb and climb and my stories about it always started with ""I remember when"". Life then took the rest of my money over the years and without anyone offering me financial advice, the part about investing for the future wasn't something I knew enough about to take seriously. So, the Apple stock was simply a treat to myself for all of the years wishing I had bought back then.

Now I know $71 isn't that much, it's hardly anything but I figure there's something that I can do with it. What though is the reason I'm here. I think the best way to look at his is as a project.

Seeing my E trade account showing $71 in cash makes me think that something needs to be done with it. It's not enough to buy another stock in Apple but it has to be enough to do something with... If I lose it, oh well, but of course I'd prefer to see a gain. Sadly I waste that much money if not more in a given day living in NYC. But let's do something with it. I do want to see if go into a stock and not simply a ""savings account"". Seriously what's the fun in that...

As for my future plans, I plan on investing the full about into my Roth allowance every year and the main plan is invest it all in Vanguard S&amp;P 500. I'm also expecting a child so I'm looking into plans that I can start for her from birth.

This $71 is going to be a side project, sort of the old trade an pencil for an apple and then hopefully the apple for a house.

Any suggestions to get this rolling?

After that I plan on buying one of each every week indefinitely, dependent on my income which is very stable right now.

Is this a good strategy? or should I choose less stocks? instead of 10, 5? or maybe they aren't good stocks?

I'm wondering: what are the factors that determine how many shares a company is divided into? I see companies with market caps in the billions with $1 stock prices, and others with $30, $100 or $1000 (or Berkshire Hathaway, comically outlying at ~$250k per share).

The price and volume are (I'd assume) set at IPO. Does the share price have any well-understood or measurable effects on how stock behaves? Why would a company choose to sell 10 million shares at $1 rather than 100,000 shares at $100 Why and when do companies decide to split their stock?",2

A reasonable discussion, although I think his conclusion is weak.

&gt; Yet after going through these exercises, it occurred to me that none of the robots know anything close to my whole situation. They never asked about [list of other things] -- things that only an investment advisor with a pulse, a business card and a license would ask. And it’s why many people won’t be ready to let the robots run their finances, no matter how smart and friendly they are. 

----

My take: If you're a young (and idealistic) investor -- which 80-90% of the posters here seem to be -- you won't have most of his [list of other things].  Thus, roboadvisors will probably work just fine for the great majority of today's readers, and this article will only add to the argument that financial planners are obsolete.",24

15-03-14,The key to the 2015 movement in oil prices...Contango,"
Right now the price of oil is reacting to a fundamental oversupply. This problem can only be solved by a fundamental supply side shock. The key to the movement of oil prices, when storage and oversupply are the issue, is the feasibility of buying and storing oil for sale at a future date. Right now, the price you will get in April 2016 for a barrel of oil is likely $11 dollars higher than the price you can currently buy it for. 

Convenient oil storage locations used in the past, designed for cheap storage are nearly full. The cost of storage per month went from $.5/month per barrel to approximately $.9/mnth per barrel to store oil for a one year contract in the Gulf Coast region. The added cost of $4.5/yr per barrel to store oil in the future leaves less profit for oil companies and speculators when choosing to store oil. Also the longer they store it, the more expensive each barrel will cost. The higher the risk. With the oversupply being the issue, if prices do not come down to incentivize storage, then where will the oil go? Companies wont store their oil for a loss, they wont drill it for a loss, so they shut it down until prices go back up.
I am betting that prices come lower to accommodate the more expensive oil storage facilities in the gulf coast before any wells get shut in. Either they store it, or leave it in the ground...

 When prices are low enough to store for good profit, producers and speculators alike  will pile in on the bullish bandwagon. Eventually, this will temporarily, prop up the price of oil, until the Gulf Coast becomes a logistics problem with capacity near full utilization...Keep in mind, technically there will still be a fundamental oversupply problem for WTI crude until winter due to the time it takes to lower production after shutting down a well(3 months). So if/when prices are higher than $43-$44 when gulf storage becomes near full...offshore storage will be the only realistic trading vehicle for future storage(Floating Storage)...The price will again have to come down to accomodate the feasability of buying oil, paying to store it, and selling it for a healthy profit within a year out at sea. Either this or oil companies take it on the chin and shut in their wells...

 Basically the party is coming to an end for most drilling and exploration companies that borrowed to excess. Lenders issued nearly a trillion dollars of high yield junk debt to finance the US crude production increase from around 4million barrels per day in 2008, to 9.3 million barrels per day in 2015. Companies expanded so quickly, taking on huge debts. Now when oil is below $60 they are having problems servicing debt obligations. Think about that. Credit card maxed, can't pay the monthly 5% fee....By 2016, I suspect at least 8% of Shale oil field companies will go bankrupt, or merge due to price pressures that will be in full force for at least 08-10 more months. The few smart CEO's will be cutting the capital expenditures focusing on production growth, and focusing on buying distressed assets for 20-40 cents on the dollar.

All together, this is not the time to go long oil companies. At least, not until after you see the oil reaction to OPEC not cutting production June 5th. Also keep any eye on weekly inventory builds. The weekly average inventory build for each month will be key in explaining how quickly storage is filling up. When you see a consistent weekly decrease of oil stockpiles, will be the time to go long. I would only recommend going long oil, if Gulf storage working capacity has not filled to 90+% capacity by June, all the while seeing consistent weekly decrease in US crude stockpiles...Otherwise, storage will fill up, and prices will have come down to accommodate offshore storage.  My best suggestion would be to just wait a bit. You can get whatever company you are looking to play the oil recovery for, wayy cheaper in a few months.",95

The hypothetical strategy would be to go short the spread. since brent trades at a roughly 10 dollar premium, which is higher than the average spread, I can short BNO, long USO, hold it for 2 or 3 weeks and (hopefully) the spread will revert to 7 or 8 dollars in the contracts, which will be reflected in the ETFs

is there something wrong with my strategy? contango will effect both ends of the trade, such that it would cancel out (for the most part), so I'm not too worried about that. BNO would have to lose a little bit every month, as would USO, but the strategy is profitable so long as the difference in the contango structure is less than or roughly equal to one another (they both pay a 2$ premium when rolling over assets, but it would be even better if USO paid 2$ premium and BNO paid a 3$ premium for the next months assets)",8

15-03-14,Trading options using play money since the beginning of the year. Looking for an explanation for what happened.,"Took an options trading class a few years back in college. We basically traded with play money using Optionsxpress.com virtual trader and talked about it. I have some experience with them, but I am by no means an expert. This is why I am here. I have stuck mostly to buying calls in SPY and have done fairly well, but i wasn't making as many trades as I would like (I want to make many so that I understand and am confident as to make all of these types of trades), so one day I started just making more trades off of bad judgement just to better understand the mechanics. 

I remembered one day in class we talked about how you position your trades so you make money whether the market goes up or down by BUYING CALLS slightly higher than where the price is currently and I believe BUYING PUTS slightly below. Basically betting that the stock is either going up or down, but not going to stay the same. I decided to attempt this with USO.

Although I don't remember selecting SELL TO CLOSE, I am pretty sure that this is what caused the problem, but logged on today to find that I owe 1000 shares of USO and my account is in the negative. 

I believe I should have BUY TO OPEN PUTS at the 18.5 mark and with USO being around 16.5, I would be in the money at this point, correct? 

As far as where I am at now, how do I return those shares or the money that I owe for them? Do I have to place another trade to balance it out? Am I correct in believing that this wouldn't have happened with a real account unless I was approved to trade on margin? 

I am just looking to learn. I attached screenshots of trade information and account balances to help.

Thanks for your time.

The answer: 2,500,000 is how much 100% of the company is valued at but what I don't understand is how dividing 500,000 by .2 (20%) gets 2,500,000 which is 100% of the company.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwkjqGd8NC4

They are adamant that low cost index funds will outperform active managed funds, because of the high cost off fees.

Can someone further corroborate or debate this theory for me? I used to have my entire 401K invested in a Fidelity mutual fund for my retirement age, and it was doing okay.

Then I rebalance my portfolio and put it mostly in aggressive equities. I think I had around 12-13% return last year, definitely better than when I had the FIDELITY 2050 mutual fund (2050 is my expected retirement age). The thing is, when I rebalanced, the cost of the newer, aggressive mutual fund even had higher fees/costs (probably because more trading is going on?).

Anyway, the reality of my own portfolio seems to go against the theory that passive, low cost index funds outperform actively managed funds.

15-03-15,Stella Jones on the Toronto exchange.,"Stella Jones  had another good quarter and I think could be worth your time to research for possible investment.

They are in the treated wood business - telephone poles and railway ties, and to a smaller extent lumber for home building.

With keystone pipeline dead for the foreseeable future, all that Alberta tar sands oil needs to be transported by rail.  And with extreme public scrutiny of environmental issues, the railroads are highly motivated to keep up with track maintenance.

Oil is used in the treatment process  - so this means some production cost savings for the company.

The decline of the Canadian dollar is beneficial to the company, and while this could work against them at some point in the future, it does not look like it will be a concern any time soon with the U.S. fed gearing up to raise rates.

 Management has been very good - Stella has achieved growth through acquiring competitors over the years, and yet they are still very lean.

So do your due diligence and have a look, and please point out any red flags you see.

I think my biggest concern about the company is that it has done so well for so long.

15-03-14,How does the YTM of a bond change as it approaches maturity?,"I am confused as to this because as a bullet bond approaches maturity its coupon rate will not change, but I would think the yield would fall to adjust for bond now having less risk? To better explain my question here is an example.

An investor has the choice between two Treasury bonds.
1. A bond that was issued 9 years ago, but matures in 1 year, is trading at par value and has a coupon rate of 10%.
2. A bond that was issued 2 years ago, but matures in 1 year. Because it was originally a shorter term bond, therefore coupon will be a lower 5%. It is also trading at par value.

In this case wouldn't the investor always choose the first bond because its yield will be higher? 

Clearly I am not understanding something here, because if I was investor looking for high yielding, shorter maturity bonds I would always choose bonds issued many years ago because their coupons will be higher, and I know this is not what actually happens. What is wrong with my thinking?

Thank you. I have tried googling this with no clear answer.

Personally I'm thinking more about mining stocks than oil, and IMHO as commodities continue their plummet we're going to see the US consumer come back, (money velocity has to turn around sometime, M1 growth has been massive but it hasn't yet turned into expanded loan growth, partly due to bank capitalization rules but also sentiment), which will pull everyone up with them, and that's when emerging markets will actually start to get better.

Everyone who has offered me words of support throughout this time, both in the thread and in private messages, thank you. I am shaken and I am deeply grateful that this lesson was such a gentle one and that I have another chance. I will try never to put myself into this situation again. ",19

15-03-16,What is the purpose of different strike prices if the option premium brings the adjusted price nearly identical?,"For example let's say an option chain for a certain date has 3 strike prices : 
   
20  
21  
22  
  
Lets say the current price of the underlying stock is currently 19.  
The options expire in a week, we'll use puts for the example.  
  
The premiums for the different strike prices  :  
  
1.05    
2.05  
3.05   
  
What's the point? If you're on the buying end you still need the stock to fall below 18.95 to exercise.  
The only thing I can see is that if you needed the immediate income as the put seller you would want to sell the 22 strike price puts, but even then what would motivate a put buyer to take that strike price?  
  
I do make a few assumptions that cause this to happen in a vacuum the main one is eliminating the bid/ask spread which in real life would cause these premiums to differ depending on the liquidity of the options. A second one is focusing mostly on intrinsic value and ignoring time value.

15-03-15,Thoughts on the markets for next week? What say you reddit?,"good morning all! hope you all are enjoying your weekend. :)

so, i just wanted to put this chart up real quick in here this morning while i had a few minutes, as i wanted to get some market insights from you good folks here at this subreddit.

* chart --&gt; http://i.imgur.com/MARfwif.png

just to give y'all a quick recap of last week's market action-

it was yet another volatile week in the markets, as my ""indices"" chart would illustrate, but it wasn't all negative out there as the risky small caps russell 2000 actually ended the week higher by +1.20%, while the other majors were all lower by -0.50% or greater.

you had 2 defensive sectors in the s&amp;p 500 higher this past week (*health care and utilities*) while the financials (*an offensive sector*) were a bright spot.

currencies were pretty much inline with the prior week's action in the sense that they were all more or less trading down against the greenback across the board ... with the euro really accelerating its losses in a biiiiiig way this past week ... wowzers has that thing been in free fall mode!

in the commodities we had metals not really getting much of any lift at all this past week, just going sideways if anything following the prior week's thrashing (*which i guess is not too bad given the surge we've seen in the greenback*), while we saw a significant decline in the crude oil, which is now approaching new 6-year lows in fact! boy has that thing just fallen out of bed this past week after breaching the $48 handle on the downside! that looks to me like it wants much lower prices (*sub-$40 anyone???*) from here ... what do you all think?

treasuries were all higher across the board (*meaning lower yields*) last week, but not by too much.

what is interesting to me in all of this volatility, is the vix (*get it, volatility? erm...nvm bad joke there lol*) the vix has barely budged during much of this market sell off ... we haven't really seen the big spike in the volatility index as one would usually assume to be the case accompanying market sell offs ... that being said though, i don't know that one can actually make too much from just this one indicator alone, but that was certainly something that had caught my eye when viewing some of the charts this weekend and thought to bring it up for discussion in here as well...

so, putting that all aside now, we can look forward onto next week -- and boy is next week going to be a doozy of a week!

we have a number of important econ. numbers coming out, but more importantly we have the all important fomc meeting announcement (*w/ a yellen press conference*) on wednesday!

why is this fed meeting so important than previous meetings? whelp, unless you have been living under a rock the past couple of weeks, you will know that this meeting could be the meeting where the fed signals that it is ready to move on interest rate hikes sooner rather than later (*preferably in june*) ... and the one thing traders will be watching in this particular statement will be the wording ""**patient**"" and if that is still present in the statement or not ...

most investors believe that if there is no ""**patient**"" in the language of next week's fed statement, then that could be the signal to the markets that the fed may in fact be ""thinking"" about moving in june ... now this is all just assuming of course, but it is interesting to see the market reaction in front of this very important fed meeting.

i mean if you just take a look at what the u.s. dollar has done and how that has been moving the past weeks, it would seem to me anyway that it is pricing something of a rate hike in a few months, no?

same could be said with the equity markets to an extent, where the markets have been trading down on positive news, and vice versa (*up on bad news*).

you guys tell me, but when you look at that u.s. dollar index chart, is that not overdone on the upside or what? while the euro on the other hand overdone on the downside?

anyway, enough of me writing! this thread was meant to get some opinions from all of you for next week ... but i just wanted to give y'all the quick rundown on the prior week's action, and what to expect for the week ahead next week.

what do you guys think? will we see any change in the fed's language come wednesday? or will the statement still be dovish as all hell as it's been for months and years on end ...

let's hear what some of you have to say on this...

thx, and i hope you all enjoy the rest of your weekend.

looking forward to hearing some of your insights in here!

**edit:** also, and not to get too technical in here, but i thought this spx daily chart was interesting to share here as well.

* chart --&gt; http://i.imgur.com/IrEp7UR.png

so, if you connect a trend line from the oct. 2014 lows to the lows in february, we're finding support at that area now and have been bouncing off of that the past couple of sessions ... as well as some resistance from the two january tops ... and price is also battling that 50sma ... so a pretty important area here i would think ... we're essentially right back in that choppy range that we've been in for much of 2015 right now ... should be interesting to see what happens with this, for this upcoming week ahead.",2

15-03-16,Labor shortage on the horizon: what does that mean for your portfolio?,"[After asking for your podcast recommendations](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2z2o72/which_investing_or_business_podcasts_do_you/), I had found and listened to the [most recent Morningstar podcast audio version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/investing-insights-from-morningstar.com/id278269517?mt=2) and Bob Johnson on there notes that a labor shortage is on the way in 2015. 

If this is true, now we have a labor shortage which could results in wage hikes + a strong dollar.

The guy on this podcast noted that *""Companies that serve the consumer and serve the middle market are going to do better. Companies that employ a lot of labor, especially skilled to semi-skilled labor are going to face wage pressure, probably bad news to offset the consumer good news...Whenever we've had periods of sharply rising wages, it's been very very bad news for corporate profits.""*

1) What are the ""Companies that serve the consumer and serve the middle market"" ?

2) Would these issues make you want to get into a certain sector/index/stock/fund, perhaps something that's not so exposed to dollar volatility, yet positively sensitive to rising wages (a natural conclusion of a labor shortage)?

Thanks for podcast recommendation, btw, I love learning about this stuff while I'm at work or shoveling snow.",2
15-03-16,"Offsetting American Airlines' (AAL) FX losses with lower fuel prices","Edit:  Thanks to /u/rambosis for pointing out that I forgot to average the changes in both FX and fuel.  I have updated the numbers to reflect this.

As American Airlines does not hedge fuel prices, it is one of the primary beneficiaries of today's record low fuel costs.  However, American Airlines also has significant FX exposure to the strong dollar.  I wanted to see if this FX headwind can blow stronger than the lower fuel price tailwind for the stock.  Here's what I found:

In [American Airlines' latest news release](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=117098&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;id=2010763), the CEO described how ""Total revenue in the fourth quarter was a record $10.2 billion, an increase of 2.1 percent versus the fourth quarter 2013 on a combined bases and excluding special times...""  I used this 2.1% multiplier to roughly estimate this quarter's revenue based off of this quarter last year.  [I arrived at a rough figure of $10.21 billion](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aal/financials/income/quarter).

Next, I looked at the strength of the USD versus the currencies of various foreign countries in which American Airlines flies.

* The [USD index has risen 6.25% over the last 3 months](https://www.google.com/finance?q=INDEXDJX%3AUSDOLLAR&amp;ei=xOkGVeK2DeHwsQf-k4CwDQ) half of this is 3.125%.

*[USD / EUR](https://www.google.com/finance?q=usdeur&amp;ei=9_YGVenUEO-Nsgehq4HYCA) has risen 18.5% over the last 3 months.  Half of this is 9.25%.

*[USD / GBP](https://www.google.com/finance?q=usdgbp&amp;ei=HfcGVemJKeqysAeX9YHYDA) has risen 6% over the last 3 months.  Half of this is 3%.

*[USD / BRL](https://www.google.com/finance?q=usdbrl&amp;ei=R_cGVdiMDqPrsQeR3oHICg) has risen 21% over the last 3 months.  Half of this is 10.5%.

*[USD / COP](https://www.google.com/finance?q=usdcop&amp;ei=b_cGVYn_NoP6sgfTtYHwCA) has risen 9% over the last 3 months.  Half of this is 4.5%

Using [American Airlines' ""Where We Fly"" website](http://www.aa.com/i18n/aboutUs/whereWeFly/maps/world.jsp?anchorEvent=false&amp;from=Nav) I was able to estimate that roughly 20% of all their flights go to Europe (of which 25% are to Great Britain) and 10% of all flights are to South America.

Using the $10.21 billion revenue estimate (which I understand is extremely rough), I estimated the following:

*$511 million in revenue is exposed to the GBP

*$1.53 billion in revenue is exposed to the EUR

*$1.02 billion in revenue is exposed to South American currencies


Using those figures, I assumed the worst (that American Airlines does not change fares in these regions and takes the full brunt of the FX hit).  This meant that AAL may lose up to $15.33 million in GBP, up to $142 million in EUR, and up to $102 million in South American currencies (I used a discount of 20% for all of South America), **totaling an FX loss of $259 million this quarter alone.**  That is significantly more than the [$30 million](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=117098&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;id=2010763) they reported last quarter.

As for fuel prices, I again used the 2% multiplier.  Total fuel costs last quarter were [$2.659 billion](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=117098&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;id=2010763).  This brings my estimate to $2.712 billion this quarter without taking into account the decline in fuel prices since December 31st.  That decline is [21 percent](http://www.cmegroup.com/apps/cmegroup/widgets/productLibs/esignal-charts.html?code=CL&amp;title=APR_2015_Crude_Oil_&amp;type=p&amp;venue=1&amp;monthYear=J5&amp;year=2015&amp;exchangeCode=XNYM), from $54.71 to $43.15.  Assuming the fuel was purchased at an average price of $48.93, a decline of 10.6%,  **this suggests a fuel savings this quarter of $287 million for this quarter from last quarter.**

All in all, the net savings for AAL is **roughly $28 million for this quarter from last quarter**, significantly less than I was expecting given the precipitous decline in fuel prices.  

What do you guys think?  What should I have done differently?

15-03-16,Options Question...,"I'm not proficient in options. I have bought a few call options and had some success and I sell covered calls and have had some success.

A couple months ago, I sold 10 covered calls. The strike price is now in the money and the expiry is JUN15, so it is likely these options will be exercised, unless the stock drops, which could happen, but is unlikely.

If the option is exercised, I will keep the option premium and the strike price is above what I paid for the shares, so I am not losing money (first rule, right?). But, the stock price right now is higher than what I would make on an exercise, so I'm wondering what my options are.

I know I can buy calls right now (at today's price) to cover the sold calls and close the position. That would be a net loss of about $4800 on the options, however, the profit is currently $9200 on the shares (were I to close that position too), so I'd be ahead about $4400.

That's choice 1.

I was also thinking that I could also buy 10 put options for the same strike price on the same date. The premium is around $1.50, so I'd be looking at about $1500 for the 10 put options. I would then have 10 Put Options that I could exercise at the strike price to cover the sold all options, but something about this doesn't quite add up and I'm not seeing why.

A put option gives me the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying asset at the strike price, right? So, if I'm holding a PUT @ 50, I have the right to sell 100 shares of XXX at $50. I could exercise the PUTS to cover the Calls sold, no? If I've sold a call (the right to 'buy') by shares @ 50, then those 100 shares would be covered by the Put. Right?

Fuck. I'm confused. Anyone that knows options well care to set me straight? Thanks!",9

Part 2 is all about investment strategies &amp; the respective risk management strategies that go with each strategy.

Today’s post is going to cover the basic definition of a stock and the appropriate value for an individual stock.

Definition

I’m going to make this part short because I want to focus on the Appropriate Value for a Stock in this post. A stock is essentially just a share in a company. If you own a company’s stock, you are essentially part-owner in that company. For example, if Apple has 900 million outstanding shares (meaning that there are a total of 900 million shares of Apple around the world). If you own 1 share of Apple, you are officially 1/900 millionth owner of Apple.

Now there are two ways of looking at stocks.

Viewing a stock as part-ownership of a business.
Viewing a stock as nothing more than an investment vehicle.
Warren Buffett views each stock as part-ownership of a business - that’s why he’s known as a value-investor. Value investors will buy stocks in a company if the business’ assets are worth more than it’s “official price”, aka its market capitalization.

On the other hand, most traders and investors see a stock merely as an investment vehicle. If they think buyers will push up the price of the stock in the future, they’ll buy it today.

So the question is, why doesn’t every look at stocks like Warren Buffett does? Because not everyone is as rich as Warren Buffett. Here’s an example.

Let’s say Company A’s assets are worth $1 billion. And let’s assume that it’s market capitalization (official price on the New York Stock Exchange) is $100 million. Thus, in Warren Buffett’s eyes Company A is a steal – you’re buying $1 billion worth of “goods” for $100 million (90% off!). Thus, Buffett would buy a lot of shares, say 30% of the company for $30 million.

If the stock price goes up because other investors recognize how undervalued this company is (90% off!), Warren Buffett will earn capital gains (profits on his investment).

But if the stock price doesn’t move, Warren Buffett can still profit! It’s unbelievable! He can just buy the rest of the company for $70 million, shut Company A down, and liquidate all it’s assets for $1 billion.

So either way, Warren Buffett makes money because he has enough money to buy the whole company! Now obviously you and I cannot do this – if the stock price doesn’t go up, we do not profit because we can’t buy the whole company and liquidate it.

That is why every investor and trader must see a stock as nothing more than an investment vehicle. Which leads me to my point.

Appropriate/Fair Value

This is the question that all investors ask – what is the fair value of a stock price. What should the price of Stock XYZ be?

The reality is - any price you want. There is no “fair market price”.

Take Netflix as an example. Netflix is a “story company”, meaning that it’s real value as a company (corporate profits, assets) equates to practically zero. Netflix’s P/E ratio (price of stock vs. earnings) is 275, meaning that if Netflix’s stock is $300, it’s making just over $1 per share.

But even at such ridiculous prices, many investors still say that Netflix is “undervalued” (meaning that it’s “fair value” is more than $300 a share). That’s ridiculous! You can define undervalued/overvalued in any way you want.

Take oil prices as an example. Think back to 2008 when oil prices were approaching $140 a barrel. At that time, legendary investor Warren Buffett said that “oil prices were undervalued” – that’s why he bought oil.

Within a year, oil prices crashed to $50 a barrel.

The point is, do not invest just because you think a stock is “undervalued”. If you need investment advice for share trading, do your research. You will be able to find a bajillion reasons even for the most ridiculous stock to be called “undervalued”. In the following posts, I will explain exactly how you should invest in stocks, bonds, currencies, and other assets.

15-03-15,Monkeys Throwing Darts,"It's an old story by now, but [here's a story](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/your-money/how-many-mutual-funds-routinely-rout-the-market-zero.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0) on a study of 2,862 actively managed mutual funds, starting in March 2009, the market bottom.  Each year the top 25% were put into the market-beater group (the others were out of the running), and that continued for 5 years.  There were 2 funds that were in the top 25% for each of the 5 years.  The number expected if we had hired those dart-throwing monkeys instead?  2,862 x (0.25)^5 = 2.8.

The story came out now because we're approaching the end of the sixth year, and neither of the 2 funds looks like it will be in the top 25%.  As, you know, 2 x (0.25) = 0.5, says it was a coin flip.

This study isn't so much about absolute performance vs the S&amp;P 500, but whether there is such a thing as stock-picking talent.  If there were, we would expect there to be some correlation between the good pickers in one year (in the top 25%) and in the next.  But once again, no evidence of that.  Some active managers with outperform in any given year and even for a series of years, but that tells you nothing about their future performance.",1
15-03-15,Retirement income investment strategy,"I've seen a bunch of posts concerning individuals who want to invest cash in order to create an income and I am curious about the specific strategies that redditors are suggesting. 

The posts go like this (ex): My mother is elderly and getting near retirement, she just received $600,000 lump sum cash (by some miracle) and she wants to know how to best invest it to get her through retirement while keeping some left over for her kids. 

Inevitably, someone suggests that she should put it all into mutual funds/ETFs which will provide roughly a 6% return giving her $36000/yr to live on. 

I'm not looking for advice of the soundness of such a strategy, I am looking for an explanation on the specific steps one takes to actually realize such a strategy. I understand the concept of dividends as a retirement income, but if the funds dont pay dividends, how do you realize those returns as an actual income without completely depleting your principal?

Here's some more detail to clarify. I'm starting a little side game because I have some cash sitting in my account, not enough to do a lot with, so I want to try something. I will be trading SPY monthly options, looking at the weekly chart to cut out a lot of the daily market noise, and because it will make the experiment go longer and keep me from doing something stupid. I'm going to buy just barely out of the money, so everything should be sold in the money. I will hold for a couple weeks, on average, and see how much I can do in ten trades.

15-03-16,Need help in a tax question (Canada and Germany),"So I am trying to figure out what the tax implications for my capital gains are. Here is my situation. 

I recently moved from Germany to Canada and still own some stocks in Germany on German accounts. So far I haven't created any tax events since I moved to Canada, but I unfortunately do not completely understand the tax implications of selling some stock in my situation.

[Here](http://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Standardartikel/Themen/Steuern/Internationales_Steuerrecht/Staatenbezogene_Informationen/Laender_A_Z/Kanada/2002-03-27-Kanada-Abkommen-DBA-Gesetz.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3) is the bilateral tax treaty between Germany and Canada. Unfortunately I am not really able to understand what this means exactly for me. 

As an example: I will sell stock and realizing a profit of 1000 Euros. In Germany there is a yearly free amount of roughly 850 Euros (or something in that order of magnitude) and assuming that this will be my only trade the whole year, I would have to pay capital gains on 150 Euros. Would I just have to pay the tax on it in Germany or would I have to pay tax on it in Canada? And if yes, in the full amount or only on 150 Euros?

15-03-17,Need advise. Getting burned on some x3 oil etfs,"So I put quite a bit of my money down on some UWTI x3 oil etfs, and I'm in at about $2.73 per. In the last several days it has dropped almost %30, down to $2.07 today. Now this would seem like an opportune time to buy, but I read that the US oil reserves are almost full, and that oil will soon plummet due to over saturation of the market; some experts say it could go to $20 per barrel (half of what it is now). It should start to go back up by the end of this year though. 

So do you guys have any advise? Should I hold on to them and see what plays out, or just eat the %30 loss? The reason I'm worried is that if it was a single etf, I should be fine. But since this is a triple etf, I have the potential to loose a lot more. 

Also, what happens if a triple etf bottoms out?

15-03-17,"I'm confused. Do the popular proponents of investing in total index funds or something similar actually practice this?","I'm a person whose exposure to the stock market is limited to my job 401k. Lately, however, I've been reading a lot about investing in the hopes of setting the stage for a retirement that makes the most of what my wife and I have, or will have.

Which at present is debt. Not a whole lot - we should be in the black sometime in 2016 for the most part, at which point we'll start an emergency savings. And then, the plan is to begin investing. But in the meantime, I'm trying to become as educated as I can about it, so that when we do invest, we can do so wisely.

After being initially seduced by the prospect of being able to demonstrate my unique and above-average predictive powers, and of course dominate the market over time, I settled down and started reading The Little Book of Common Sense Investing. What Bogle says makes sense to me so far. I'm contemplating throwing out all my excitement and buying into the prospect of movement-free, hands-off investing for the long haul.

After all, who am I to question Bogle? Buffet references this book in the latest Berkshire letter and recommends index fund investing to his heirs. Who am I to question him? Graham says the short-term market is a voting machine, and the long-term market is a weighing machine. Who am I to question him? There are plenty of others echoing this same simple philosophy.

My problem is, do these guys actually invest the way they suggest others do? And if not, why not? I mean, is Buffet's track record exclusively long-term buy and hold? Seems like there is a lot of movement in his portfolio. Is it simply that this is what they do, and they have round-the-clock teams of specialists that the average dufus like me does not have access to? Even so, wouldn't it be more prudent for them to practice what they preach, especially when they preach it so persuasively?

I'm a total newbie, so no doubt I'm venturing into waters I am completely unprepared for here, and I am possibly coming off like a dumbass. But I really wanna understand. Anyone care to enlighten me (and other readers like me) about this seeming discrepancy between the theories of some successful investors and their actual practices? Thanks ahead of time.",4

15-03-17,How to Identify the Short Term Market Peak,"For short term investors and traders, it’s crucial to recognize the short term market peak when it happens.  I’ve already discussed the characteristics of long term, multi-year bull market peaks. This time we’re looking at short term peaks (that are not new all time highs) and their characteristics to help you maximize returns on your private investments.

 

Define a Short Term Market Peak

Before we identify the common characteristics of a short term market peak, we must first define this term. Here’s an example – GDX, the gold miner’s ETF:

 Multiple Resistance
Multiple Resistance
No New All Time High

As you can see from the chart above, this type of short term market peak is not near an all-time high. Rather, the market has fallen for a while, and this is the short term market peak during one of the waves in a subsequent uptrend.

Time Frame

The “wave” lasts just a few months – anything longer than 4 months, and this is not considered to be a “short term” market peak.

The Above Example

As you can see the chart for GDX (gold miners ETF) above, GDX has fallen for almost a year now (which coincides with the decline in gold and silver). Only recently has GDX moved off of its lows. This fits in perfectly with the “short term” market peak concept. GDX is nowhere near an all time high (in fact, it GDX just hit bottom), and this recent wave has only lasted over a month.

Identify the Peak

When you make short term investment decisions, you absolutely have to use technical analysis. However, the problem is that there are many technical indicators. In the event that these indicators are sending mixed signals, which one should you use? Which one is more important and can override the others? I honestly don’t know.

HOWEVER, I do know that when all the technical indicators align and point towards one direction, the probably of that happening greatly increases. If all my technical indicators send out a clear SELL signal, then the odds of the market falling is very likely.

Regarding short term market peaks, 4 things will send a clear SELL signal when they all happen at the same time:

Major resistance.
Heavy volume.
Intraday bloodbath.
Connections between markets.
Major Resistance

Markets will often peak at a price that was a massive historical resistance point. If you look at the GDX chart below, you’d notice that GDX failed to break through this resistance barrier multiple times in the past 6 months. Thus, the fact that GDX is right below this resistance level today means that it will likely fail to break this resistance (again). This sends a major warning sign that the short term peak is in.

 Multiple resistances, + the recent massive red bar
Multiple resistances, + the recent massive red bar
Heavy Volume

A lot of traders like to look at volume – I don’t really know why. They believe that volume sends a lot of clear signs – personally, I can’t seem to make volume work to my advantage.

However, volume is really useful when the market faces a major resistance and promptly falls. Such a decline in market price combined with heavy selling means that the market is very weak. Thus, a clear warning sign that the market might peak is sent.

Massive Red Intraday Bar

If the market falls really hard one day without any meaningful support, it will create a massive red intraday bar. This means that the market is really, really weak because there is virtually no support. Coupled with heavy volume, this sends a clear sign that the bears vastly overpower the bulls.

Connections Between Markets

I don’t just look at one market – I look at 8 markets. I look at multiple U.S. stock indexes (Russell, S&amp;P500, NASDAQ), multiple commodity markets (gold, silver, copper, oil), and currencies (primarily the EURO/USD pair). Why?

Because markets are highly correlated nowadays, what happens in one market will affect other markets. For example, I recently believe that the short term peak for stocks is in. Thus, stock prices will fall. When stock prices will fall, it will likely drag down gold and GDX (gold miners) prices with them.

Summary

When the following three things happen at the same time, it is very, very likely that the short term market peak is in:

A massive red intraday bar.
Heavy volume – this is the only time when volume is useful.
A massive resistance line that has stopped the market on multiple occasions.
Other markets are falling, dragging down this market with it.",1

I receive a small stipend from my university, about enough to live off, however from this I owe ~$700 in federal taxes for the 2014 year. My parents both work in finance and they were explaining to me that if I invest $1.1k in a traditional IRA then I won't end up owing any federal taxes. They figured it would be good for me to invest some money in retirement at a young age, and learn a bit about investments. I'm a financially frugal person, and have always wanted to own some stocks, so this is really exciting for me in kind of a nerdy way.

&amp;nbsp;

My dad told me to open a traditional IRA through Vanguard (not a roth IRA). He said I can pick from any infinite number of investments, and that I should do my research and find one I like.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;
 
I have three questions:
 
1) Can I open my IRA by investing in an ETF? Based on a little research i did, i like the Vanguard Health Care ETF as a high risk option, and the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF as a less risky option. 
2) What are my options for investing only 1.1k. I see a lot of vanguard options require a 3k minimum.
2) Also, what kind of investments would you suggest? I am only investing a small amount, and i'm young, so would it be better to pick a high risk and highly volatile option? Or would a safe option, like an S&amp;P 500 still give me good returns in the future?

&amp;nbsp;
 
I'm going to call Vanguard tomorrow morning and talk to their customer service to see what my options are. Many thanks for the advice!",2

15-03-16,Why Is Offshore Investing More Attractive?,"We have all heard of the term offshore investment or offshore account. Probably, the first thing that comes to mind is some sort of criminal trying to hide money somewhere so that the authorities can’t track it down! Movies and TV series aside, offshore investments can offer some fairly attractive benefits.
Offshore investing is not quite as simple as opening up a secret account somewhere that the tax man doesn’t know about. They actually offers a variety of different options. Different types of account include growth, income and money funds. Unless you know exactly what you are looking for, my first piece of advice is to talk to an expert to put an offshore investment strategy in place. There is no one solution fits all here – depending on the duration of your investment and the sort of risk you are willing to take; every investment strategy is entirely unique.
Given that I can’t offer you any specific advice on individual offshore investment strategies, let me give you some great reasons why to consider offshore investments in the first place.
Diversify Your Opportunities
Offshore investment offers far more investment opportunities than onshore investment. More options allow for diversification of investments in international stocks and hence, reduced risk. Offshore investments funds are also some of the best performing in the world!
Tax Relief
This is the big one! While there are various tax loopholes that can be exploited, there are two obvious tax breaks:
Expatriates Tax Relief
UK nationals who are living abroad or who are planning to move abroad can claim tax relief on the interest earned while out of the country. HMRC call this ‘time-apportionment’ relief. For example, if a you are a non-resident for 4 years out of a 5 years bond, you are only liable to pay tax on 20% of the gains. Equally, if you are considering emigration, the destination country may hold more favorable taxes.
Non-Domiciles Tax Relief
The law in the UK changed recently which resulted in non-domiciles being subject to pay tax on non-UK assets. By opening Offshore bonds, this liability can be deferred until non-domiciles return home / leave the country. Essentially, this prevents these assets being subject to HMRC taxation.
Circumvent Forced Heirship
You may be unaware of this point, but the legal systems of numerous countries (including France, Saudi Arabia and Japan) allow for a person’s will to be altered after death. Forced Heirship essentially involves dividing a persons assets into two portions – an indefeasible and discretionary portion. Assets can be reallocated under law and against the deceased wishes.
By investing in certain offshore options, you can avoid forced heirship under local laws and be satisfied that the divvying up of your estate will be executed according to your wishes.
Getting Started
If you have some money and a diversified and sound investment portfolio is what you are looking for then you should consider offshore savings. Like other financial products, different banks / institutions offer a wide variety of different products which come different benefits. Take some time to have a look what is available in your country and choose the best offshore savings accounts.",1

15-03-17,Why you should consider real estate investing in 2014,"Real estate investments haven’t performed so well over the last couple years, as the bursting of the housing bubble really hurt the market and impacted many lives in a negative way. In fact, some people question whether real estate is the cash cow and successful market that it always promised to be.

 

But if you look at the rates of return on real estate over the past several years, the picture becomes much stronger than just taking the market at face value. In fact, in 2012, 2013, and now looking ahead to 2014, the real estate market from an investor’s point of view may not get much stronger than it is right now.

 

In 2010 and 2011 alone, the FTSE NAREIT Index, which measures real estate investments listed on NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX, returned more than 25 percent for the average investor! Understand, though, that the NAREIT Index primarily covers publicly traded companies which work in commercial properties, malls, office buildings, and more mass real estate and development.

 

For the average investor, public REIT investments allow the little guy to play with the “big boys,” while still retaining liquidity and security. Options like this make commercial real estate investments – and investing in real estate in general – a viable option for many people.

 

More than just public REITs, though, real estate is a decent investment on a small scale for any investor due to the bounce back of the housing market. Housing values are up, and have been consistently up for the last 12-18 months depending on your location across the country, though they still may not reach the double-digit levels of several years ago.

 

Nevertheless, both residential and commercial real estate are starting to bounce back from recession, and builders across the country are beginning to take on new construction projects, while investors have injected millions of dollars of capital back into the market for future investment and business.

 

It’s important to understand the economic backdrop while investing, but for the foreseeable future, the real estate market both residentially and commercially is on the rise. But the bottom line remains; the trend in real estate is your friend! Investors stand to make big money off their investments and assets if they approach it wisely and invest with the smarts and intelligence needed to see the pay-off in the long run.

 

Consider investing in real estate as rates and returns climb. Do not count on 20-plus rates that had become commonplace over the last several years prior to the housing market bubble bursting, but understand that the overall economic backdrop is improving. Rents are increasing, prices are increasing, and home valuations are still below their historic levels.

 

We may not be completely out of the woods yet as we still recover from the housing bubble that burst just a few short years ago, but as long as the economy continues to strengthen on the path it’s been heading, there is money to be made in the real estate market – whether commercial or residential – in 2014 and beyond.",1

Yesterday I had 1300 downloads!! If I can keep that pace up this month, I can earn money doing this podcast and continue to teach financial literacy!!! Thank you so so much

**EDIT3**: I'm going to start responding back mid tomorrow (have to sleep and a couple meetings). If I do not get back to you in two days, shoot me another PM. It means I missed your message :) Not that I'm not interested. Promise. I'm meeting my first redditor tomorrow - so it starts!

EDIT2: I did this to myself haha. Please bear with me if you don't hear from me from some time. Every message I send, I have another waiting.

EDIT: My inbox! I am sending out copy/pasted messages. Please don't take offense...I will read your messages before we meet but for right now I am organizing everything so take my copy/pasted message for now.


I want to give back to a community that has given me so much. Throughout my career trading and being in public markets, many individuals – both students and people trying to make an industry switch, have come to me for advice. I have helped people get jobs. Many Redditors shoot me messages asking for advice and I spend at least an hour on each one. I’ve realized many people would benefit from this help, and it’s something I know that allows me to give back.

So, I am dedicating helping 5 Redditors a week in career counseling to break into something that is public markets facing (trading at a bank, high freq. trading, hedge funds, mutual funds, and so on).  This will take 3-4 hours of my time each week. I don’t have an end date for when I’ll stop providing these services.

SO! Please shoot me a PM that:

1)	Briefly describes your background

2)	What are you trying to do (student breaking into wall st., career change, sellside to buyside, buyside to buyside)

3)	Is this urgent (i.e. do you have an interview coming up in the next month)?: Yes/No


If you are just trying to decide if a career in public markets is for you, that’s fine too. Just send me at least #1. 

After I get that and we decide a date, you can decide our method of communication:

1)	Call

2)	Video chat

3)	Meet me up in person (NYC-based)

I will not communicate over E-mail or Reddit messages unless you have a hearing disability.  

My background was not in finance, and I pretty much self-taught myself and sought out mentors who guided me and helped me land the gigs I wanted.   If I can do it, you can as well. You can hear about my story in my podcast: ""QA.1 How I Hustled My Way onto Wall St: An Elaborate Tale of Overcoming Many Setbacks""

What dream did Reddit help me accomplish?

I’m volunteering these services because over a year ago I left a quant fund to pursue my dreams.  The fund was doing very well, I was the first employee, we saw massive growth, great performance, and discussions were starting about making me partner. But I had to leave. I couldn’t take it anymore.

 I left the industry after working at a bank, fund, working for two different market wizards under different capacities, and finally being on an E-mail chain with me and 7 other traders including my trading idol (Tudor) discussing ideas.  Yes, that E-mail was so impactful for me, I am bringing it up here. I had an amazing time but in my heart I knew I had to pursue something else.
I left unexpectedly and everybody was confused, called me crazy, insane, and so on. Even I thought I was being an idiot. But over time, I decided to pursue a dream I had previously pursued before, but wasn’t successful at in the past.

 My dream: teaching financial literacy and advanced trading/investing concepts to the everyday person. 

But this time I decided to pursue my dream in a different medium.

I created a podcast, shared it with friends and they loved it. I then posted it on Reddit and the feedback I got from you was so amazing.  I didn’t really tell you all that this was my dream, but a few friends told me they could hear the joy in my voice from creating this. Well things took off since then and the podcast has now over 1,000 downloads and is in the front and center of “New &amp; Noteworthy Business” on iTunes. Even if this is the peak of my podcast and it’s downhill from here, I know that I’ve engaged hundreds of people already and I’ve done some good.

I know this sounds silly Reddit – leaving a successful gig and career in markets to pursue a dream teaching financial literacy. But screw it. It’s my dream and my life you all have already helped me on my journey to fulfillment. 

I was thinking of many ways to give back, but since I constantly get PMs from individuals asking me for advice for getting a public markets job; that I think this is the best medium to give back.
And if you all are curious, here are the podcasts.

15-03-17,"Do you think open, community-driven funds would work?","A friend (u/zoziac) and I recently left our jobs in finance to explore some different opportunities. We’ve been thinking about the possibility of open sourced investment funds run by the community and wanted to hear if people think this would be valuable.

Just for some background - we both have worked in financial technology for the last 10 years or so - I built automated trading systems at Bridgewater and Blue Mountain Capital; he built risk control and portfolio management systems. 

In exploring the space for the past couple of months we came up with some thoughts:

* It seems like robo-advisors are doing a good job at lowering barriers for people to start investing their money wisely (particularly the younger generation). They may still be charging a little too much (15-30bps) for what they are doing, are generally not very tailored to individual needs (most use something like 1-10 risk tolerance scale), and are possibly over diversified / more complex than they need to be. Do people share this view?

* Anecdotally, we have a lot of friends that shy away from investing. This is usually because the number of options are daunting or they know enough to know that people are trying to sell them something and that those people may not have their interests at heart. Some of them end up in Wealthfront or similar, some with traditional advisors, some just holding cash/CD’s.

* It seems like good, basic education exists i.e. there is general consensus on r/personalfinance about what financial priorities should be and in places like bogleheads about what a low overhead passive strategy should be. A theme of these sources is that they are transparent, community reviewed and are evolving over time but become more stable as they are refined to the general consensus. However, it’s still difficult for people who don’t know exactly where to look; they have to navigate a lot of jargon, lingo and noise or do enough research into the community to know the advice is well accepted.

The goal should be to give people the knowledge and tools they need to invest easily and with the confidence that they are doing the right thing. We think that a completely open mode of operating along with having the community weigh in, is the only real way to give people this confidence. The amount of value that wikipedia and open source software has added to the world has transformed the landscape in a way no one could have imagined, and we think investment management might benefit from similar forces.

So ... we came up with the idea of open investment funds that are designed and structured by the community. If it made sense for these to be funds that were managed / operated according to the agreed upon structure, maybe we could set that up. If the best option was just for people to use existing accounts, there could be lists of instructions or an open source way to connect to the accounts and execute on their behalf. 

Initially the goal would be to cover more basic, passive portfolios, but the idea would extend to active funds, maybe ones that bring together people with similar interests to focus on a particular source of alpha.

Any thoughts / feedback?",47

15-03-17,Financing options on 10 unit apartment complex,"I am looking into purchasing a 10 unit apartment complex as my first investment property. The property is listed at $215k and brings in around 65k a year at full occupancy. Owner currently pays all expenses (electricity, gas, water, ...etc) which came out to about $20k in 2014. My current bank offered me the following financing options for the property:

Purchase financing up to 80% (unless noted by rate/structure below).
·         No origination fee.
·         No application fee.
·         No appraisal fee.
·         15 year fully amortizing loan with 15 year fixed rate – 6.53% (maximum 75% LTV).
·         10 year note with 25 year amortization – 6.85% (maximum 75% LTV).
·         5 year note with 25 year amortization – 6.27%.

These interest rates look high compared to my current mortgage (3.625%). Do banks generally offer higher interest rates on commercial properties? Should I keep looking around for better financing?

I can afford putting 20% down, but want to make sure I'm not getting the shaft before I sign any paper work. Any advice you could give me would be greatly appreciated.

15-03-17,Effects of rising rates and the anticipation of rising rates on floating rate corporate bonds.,"I've been thinking about starting a position in a floating rate bond fund in anticipation of rising interest rates. I am trying to find a relatively safe place to park some money while I wait for the knee jerk reaction in the market when rates rise (assuming they do). I would then assess the situation and move accordingly.  
  

My thinking is that the fund which keeps 80% of it's investment in floating rate corporate bonds and 20% in varying parts of the corporate debt structure would not be hit by a short term rate rise. However in doing my due diligence I learned that floating rate bonds usually correspond with the LIBOR as opposed to the treasury yield. Even so I feel like they would still be either unaffected or positively affected by a rise in short term rates.  
  
Is this logic sound? Can someone help me think through correlations with the LIBOR and the treasury rate? I don't know very much about the LIBOR. I'm doing my own research but I thought I'd check here as well to see if anyone had any insights.",5

Question is - does company have to provide any of these numbers - current valuation, total number of shares or AMT when I'm exercising my stock options?

Can oil be ""priced in"" so easily? People who actually physically buy oil are less than 3% of buyers according to investopedia so it is not like the price of oil is grounded in much. It could zip up and down like TSLA if it wanted. Also there are stocks that seem to quite closely track the price of oil.

WTI dropped to $45 then went back up to around $50 and hovered there between $47 and $55 through February until about March 12. My general theory is the momentum of the drop since November carried it to $45 then it recovered, but now fears of storage capacity running out have triggered another plunge. However watching storage capacity steadily decrease you think people would have predicted this.

Either it has already been priced in to a reasonable degree and the price has dropped below $43 due to speculators whose actions couldn't be predicted with any accuracy or big investors were unwilling to take the risk and prices of $40 to $55 are in the ""grey area"".

Or the big hedgies could be pricing it in at a gradual pace. When WTI first dropped below $47 in January it might have been considered too low but now storage is closer to full capacity they might have decided to short at prices this low.

It could be that Saudi Arabia may at any moment cut production lending unpredictability to the situation so the big banks aren't willing to commit. Or they could fear ""unknown unknowns"" or some black swan event and are only taking low risk actions.

**AXN** the price will depend if the stock can break out above 2.15 in the morning. If the stock doesn't hold it in the aftermarket I will go short risking off that mark. Expecting it to either stuff into that mark then break down OR the stock gaps up and parabolics to the 2.50 mark and I will go short risking on the peak. (shorting when it shows weakness).



**REPH** had a technical breakout and now it is just ridiculously overextended. I will be using after-market action as a guide to determine  if the stock will be holding under 8.30. If it does hold under 8.30 I will short risking off that mark. If the stock begins to ramp up, I will keep an eye on the 8.60 - 8.80 mark to determine an entry (obviously shorting risking off the high of the day). 



**BDE** I am very tempted to buy this now. It is up on this: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/black-diamond-reports-record-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2014-results-2015-03-16-161952910?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts). Also having a longterm breakout of 9.5. I think it would be insane to try and risk shorting this stock. I would be looking to get long on any dips. (I really am not specific on this stock, I will be very reactive if I trade it).



**ARCO** reallllly ramped up on this: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/arcos-dorados-reports-fourth-quarter-full-year-2014-financial-results-2015-03-17?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts). It also reallly appeared to squeeze (twice). I think one of 2 things will happen, it will not gap that much and parabolic to the .25 - 40 mark in the morning then pullback. I would be looking to short risking off the high of the day. Or it will gap up and parabolic over 5.50, I will be looking to short weakness around whole/half dollar marks if that happens.



**OREX** is a dead cat bounce + a lot of short squeezes. I know from the past that this stock is a very emotionally driven stock. I will be using the aftermarket to determine my risk and will be shorting anticipating a quick washout in the morning (to ideally the 7.10 - 7.20 mark).



**AFMD** is on SSR after a very volatile intraday collapse. To be honest, I am likely not going to trade it unless it washsout quickly in the morning. I will go short risking off of 8.

Additionally, on an interesting side note the company was mentioned in Joel Greenblatt's book, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius, as an investment he made when it spun out in 1995. The company also has basically no debt and is not prone to bankruptcy unlike its other peers with high leverage if another crisis was to hit the auto industry.

I went bullish, and invested all my money into SLTD. I have lost $7000, and haven't made any profit since we started. Our professor just updated the rules, saying we are allowed to reset our account at any time. What stocks should I invest in? And can I use the account reset to my advantage?",2
15-03-17,A few questions before opening a Roth IRA,"I'm 26 and have no retirement savings at the moment. I've been doing a lot of research, and I'm on the verge of opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard, and going with their 2050 Target Retirement Date fund. But as I started to go through the process of actually choosing my funds, my head started to spin at all the options. [124 in total](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/all-vanguard-funds).

My understanding is that the Target Retirement funds simply choose a combination of these Vanguard funds to provide the ""correct"" amount of risk. Is that true? 

Is there any reason that I *wouldn't* want to do that? For example, the 2050 fund is made up of:

Fund | Percent
---|---
Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares | 62.9%
Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares| 27.1%
Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund Investor Shares | 8.0%
Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund Investor Shares | 2.0%

Once I have enough invested, wouldn't I want to move away from the 2050 fund, and invest in each of these individually with Admiral shares in order to lower my expense ratio?

Lastly, this is probably a dumb question, and I probably know the answer but have forgotten during all my research. But why would I open a Roth IRA instead of a standard brokerage account? With a Roth IRA, that money is essentially locked away until retirement. And even though this would be unlikely, I wouldn't have the option of withdrawing the money if something unexpected came up. Plus my annual contributions are capped. So what are the advantages of a Roth IRA since it seems to strip you of a lot of flexibility?",0

15-03-17,Inherited 700k of horribly undiversified stocks,"Hello r/investing,

 

I’m using a throwaway just in case some of my friends have discovered my reddit profile…

 

Long story short, I’ve inherited a large amount of stocks (~700k). These stocks are essentially all US domestic, mainly large cap, and horribly undiversified. There’s ~300k in energy (oil), 200k in technology, roughly 150k in biotech, and the balance in consumer staples and consumer discretionary. No materials, no infotech, no industrials, no financials.

 

Some background on me: I’m 25, make ~75k per year pre-tax, and my yearly expenses are probably ~20k.

I have been trying to diversify by buying Int’l mutual funds in my Roth IRA (5.5k/year), buying precious metals (physical bullion), and trimming the larger holdings to move into deficient sectors. However, these accounts have huge amounts of unrealized capital gains, so I would have a huge tax liability if I were to try to re-diversify over the course of one year or two.

 

I would appreciate any help or guidance in figuring out how to diversify my holdings without incurring too much of a tax liability (if that’s even possible). I realize this is basically the ultimate first world problem, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for your help!",52

15-03-18,"Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index up over 78% in the past year, is it because of cheap oil?","Let me preface this by saying that I'm a beginner in the world of investing and I'm trying to learn and understand how and why markets move.

I looked at the [Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index](https://www.google.com/finance?q=SHA%3A000001) and I was surprised to see it was up a whopping 78.47% in the last 12 months. To put this into context, between Jan 2009 and Oct 2014 it grew by about 20%. According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE_Composite_Index), the SSE Composite Index is a stock market index of all stocks (A shares and B shares) that are traded at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The SSE has a little over 1000 companies [listed](http://english.sse.com.cn/listed/list/).

If I add a Crude Oil Short ETF to the [graph](https://www.google.com/finance?q=SHA%3A000001,SZO), it seems to track with the SSE index.

Is the SSE Index move due solely to cheap oil ? When the oil does go back up, do you think we'll see a similar move with the SSE Index or maybe a slightly smaller crash in the SSE index in relation to the rising oil prices because the companies there would have already profited from the cheap oil ? 

Edit: For those with investments in the SSE (not me), wouldn't it be prudent to get out now or in the near future ?",12

15-03-19,Could someone explain to me how derivative market making works?,"So I have an interview on Saturday at a market making firm in Chicago. They make markets in derivatives - equity, agricultural, index, etc. I have experience buying (speculating on) options, but not writing them, since I don't have enough capital. I know the basics, but I'm confused about a couple things:

- When you write an option, what happens after that? How do you close the position (Can you at all if the underlying moves against you? Or are you stuck with it until the expiration?) I know that if, say, you write a put and it expires with the underlying above the strike, you just keep the premium and that's it.

- One of the questions they're going to ask in the interview (that I read on Glassdoor) is: ""do we hold positions?"" What is the answer to this? They are strictly market makers.

- How does market making work in futures? The same as options?

15-03-18,Bond funds: how is pricing affected by rate changes and speculation?,"I know the basics: when rates go up, bond prices go down, generally equivalent to a percent equal to the duration multiplied by every 100 basis points.  So if the fed raises rates 1%, and my bond has a 5 year duration, I could reasonably expect my bond to decrease in trading value by 5%.  However, I'm not interested in holding actual bonds, but rather bond funds (considering AGG ETF)

My question pertains to how much of this translates to index ETFs that track a huge index of thousands of bonds, how long this takes to happen, and also how the price can be affected by other factors.  For instance, in my example above, if the Fed introduces that 1% hike on a certain day, does my AGG fund lose 5% that same day?  I suspect not...  Does it usually happen over a period of time before the date, after the date?  How long of a period of time does the change typically occur over?

Also, to what degree are bond ETFs affected by supply/demand in addition to the actual rate hike?  Can an ETF even be affected by additional supply/demand issues, if it tracks an index?

Bonds are a bit of a mystery to me, but I'm eager to learn.  I know people hate bonds right now, but I'm asking for my parents, who are holding almost all cash in their 401k.  We want to put the money to work, but it's a tumultuous time for bonds, so I'd like to understand the risks of buying into bonds right now.  Of course, they'll be buying into some stocks as well.

15-03-18,"Our data shows that Teachers' are better investors than pretty much anyone else","Hi, Dave from Openfolio here.

We've been digging through our community data and found an interesting insight. Our latest snapshot shows that teachers outperformed 80% of all investors over the past year.

As of Feb 26th, the average teacher was up 10.2% over the past year compared to an average investor return of just 7.6%. 

Why did teachers outperform other professions? 3 reasons:

1) Teachers trade less, implying a longer-term investment horizon. Teachers traded just 6.1 times a year, compared to an average of 9.1. Economic research has consistently shown patient investors outperform.

2) Teachers are more invested. They hold less of their portfolio in cash.

3) Teachers are more diversified. Their allocation to diversified funds is 12% higher than the average investor.

What’s more? Teachers lucked out on winning themes. Teachers have 2x the average allocation to life sciences (like biotech and pharmaceuticals) and half the average allocation to financial services. This has proved very prescient as biotech outperformed and financials under performed over the past year.

15-03-18,How I pick my trades,"I have received several requests from fellow Redditors wanting me to tell them my ""secrets"" to picking my trades. It's not really a secret. It's just a technique I taught myself after failing many, many times. It's very simple but it is time consuming and it requires discipline and quick thinking.

First of all, if you like to gamble or take risks or if you are a greedy person, this is not for you. Hell, day trading is not for you. My system is not going to magically find a homerun every time. I listed my pick for Monday (STRL) and it WAS a homerun but my picks for Tuesday both had modest gains and a risk of $20,000 netted me about $800 for the day. My daily goal is $1000 and I normally risk between $10,000 and $30,000 per day.

The tools I use are my TD Ameritrade account, the TDA Think or Swim platform, Stock Hacker on the TorS platform, and a subscription service called Street Insider. I also use Google Alerts. 

Everyday towards the end of the trading day after I have closed all of my positions, I open the Stock Hacker tool on the Think or Swim platform. I set my filters for stocks that traded that day from .50 to $4.00 and that have a minimum volume of 100,000. I look at both NYSE and NASDAQ. This gives me about 200 stocks to research. On the list, next to the ticker symbol are several icons. I search each icon until I find stock that have earning reports due out the next morning or after the market closes. That usually gives me about 10 to 40 stocks to research. I then set up alerts on Street Insider and Google alerts for those companies. stock USUALLY go up on positive news. The more positive, the more they go up. I pick 1 to 3 stocks and make a decision to buy based on those news reports.

I normally get in and get out within an hour after the markets open. Then I watch and if there is an opportunity to go back in and buy those same stocks on a bounce, I do it. I have bought and sold a stock 3 or 4 times in a day.

I have several opinions that I would like to share with new traders. First, for the first 3 months, DO NOT TRADE WITH REAL MONEY. TDA will allow you to trade with paper money using the Think or Swim platform, and Stock Hacker. Do this first. Second, I don't care what anybody says, DO NOT TRADE PINK SHEETS OR OTCBB STOCKS. Only a handful of traders win on those stocks and it's not going to be you.

Good Luck!

I know the United States is upping its domestic supply, but are there good international oil companies that are trading low right now but are expected to rise?  If you think investing in oil right now is a good idea, what stocks are you considering?  Your input is greatly appreciated!",2
15-03-18,Using a bond index fund as your savings account,"A little background about me - age 26, salary $63,500 pre tax and my expenses are pretty low. I aim to invest about 40% of my after tax income on a lot of months and then I will have an occasional month where I go on a vacation and save a lot less.

&amp;nbsp;

My investments are index funds which include large, mid and small cap US stocks, a REIT index, a total international stock index, and 2 individual stocks. 

&amp;nbsp;

I don't have a specific plan for a time when I am going to buy a house, but it's definitely something I will consider within the next couple years.  I want to start diverting some money toward a savings account in case I need a down payment.  I could always withdraw from my stock funds, but I'd rather leave those alone and let them grow.  Would putting money into a bond index fund to act as a savings account be a good idea?   That way it's still liquid and I can at least get 3-4% a year instead of the pennies I would get in a Bank of America savings account.  I don't have experience investing in bonds but I don't see much of a downside.  The fund I'm looking at is VBTLX",42

15-03-18,Oil Prices,"Could the recent drops in crude oil prices brought on by supply gluttony be underscored with purpose? As we say goodbye to winter and spring into spring, oil refiners struggle with the switch from winter to summer blends. The small period of spring between the winter and the summer months is an intriguing one for oil suppliers near and far from the ground to the pump.
The summer as we know is a mixed period of consumption with a drop from a lack of school commuters, but a rise from vacationers. The seasonal shore traffic near the coast for instance shows the inner home dwelling cave people fleeing towards the Vitamin D they crave and reserve for the darkest months.
With low oil prices pushing down new supply initiatives, existing extractors hold the competition by the balls. By reducing extraction rates suddenly, those already pumping become the main contenders for the summer months when demand increases, and fare to make a much heftier pay day than they would during these spring months. I expect oil to rise in May as we spring forward into summer.

15-03-19,Business investment question,"I am looking at investing in a small business and have a question about the transaction. What I am looking at doing is buying 20k worth of a company via convertible loans.  Option to sell at 2 years and at 5 you can sell or convert to shares of said company.  

The loan is at a 12% interest rate per year for those first 5 years and will be paid out biannually.the financials look good but the current owners have been using the company as their personal bank account and although they have kept the company stable they haven't reinvested anything in awhile.

So far i have primarily been an etf index investor (yes before you ask.....vanguard!) with a portfolio that is 80% etfs and 20% stocks (growth orientated) and have been very happy as a EU investor having my money in Dollars right now however my tax situation is a bit different from what is ""normal"" given that all my investment income (capital gains+dividends) are pooled together and i pay a rate of 27% (up till around 7000USD thereafter 42% on additional income) therefore i am wondering if some more experienced minds can help me with investment strategy.
The positive side that i see in dividend income is cash flow that i can use for re investing where im only taxed 27% (my income tax rate is 44%... not a high earner, in the middle bracket i suppose, but just to put things in perspective). Fyi i currently have about 20kUSD invested and i will be able to add 1500usd every month and i have a long investment timeframe in mind, i would appreciate hearing about your experiences and your own investment strategies!

15-03-19,The Pros and Cons of Selling Your Annuity,"The annuitization process is lengthy and provides the holder with a lot of security. So it begs the question, “Why would you ever want to sell your annuity?” The reasons are typically complicated and unanticipated. For those who don’t know, annuities are financial products that you save up over time. Monthly payments are put away, drawing interest, while you wait for some time in your life when you’ll need income. Then you stop paying into the annuity, and it starts to empty back into your bank account, acting just like income.

This acts as a measure of security for older people, those who are no longer working, or people who can’t earn enough money through the work they do. Annuities are great and can be set up by individuals themselves, or given as gifts by loved ones or other concerned parties. When a situation comes up that requires money fast, some people are forced to sell this valuable financial product. We’re going to deal with some of the pros and cons of doing this, as well as alternative solutions.

 Pros of Selling Your Annuity:

Convenience. It is much easier to live off of a lump sum than it is to live off of smaller payments issued regularly through an annuity or similar product. There are plenty of companies who want to buy your annuity, so you’ll have no difficulty selling it (providing the sale is legal. You have to have a good reason for selling, one which necessitates the sale or the result of which will benefit you greatly).
Flexibility. Because annuity payments come into your life like income, you can only use the money a little at a time. This cuts out a lot of potential purposes for the money, purposes that you can consider once you have it all in one place at one time. Purposes like this include: buying a house, getting further education, paying down a big loan, etc.
Cons of Selling Your Annuity:

You Lose Money. This is the give and take of the annuity selling process. Of course by gaining the financial convenience and flexibility, as described above, you’ll have to pay. And you pay by giving up some of the value of your annuity to the company that you’re selling it to. You and (hopefully) your financial professional will decide if the benefit of the cash is worth the loss of value that you incur.
The Pros and Cons of Selling Your Annuity – Alternatives:

You may have alternatives! If you own your home, a home equity loan may tithe you over to accomplish your goal without sacrificing your annuity. Short of that, there may be other loans available to you through your bank or even micro-lending institutions. But if there are no good terms available to you, the only option remaining may be the sale of your annuity. While no one wants to sell an annuity, the sale can give you all kinds of options that an annuity doesn’t. Go into the sale with care and consideration, but be confident if you feel that it is the right decision for you. For more advice on selling your annuity, look into your state’s laws about selling one.",1
15-03-18,Is there a delay when trying to sell stocks?,"(I'm fairly new to selling stocks, so please forgive the possible naïveté of my question.)

The stock reaches $1.21 @ 3:15 PM, and I decide to sell.

15-03-19,Buying a house cash: being truly at home,"Last year I visited a friend in the US, and he had just bought a house for his family. ”Congratulations on buying a house!” I said. He pointed out to a small closet and replied “oh, that closet is ours, the rest belongs to the bank”. Like the majority of households those days, they would spend the next 25 years buying back their house from the bank.

 

At this time, I owned two rental properties but was traveling around so I was really homeless, living out of two motorcycle panniers for 6 months. I was starting to feel the need to settle down, and even better, in a paid for home.

 

Could it be that difficult? Well, yes. First, because prices are higher. Two generations ago, buying a house cash after five years or savings was not unusual. A mortgage would be paid of in ten or twelve years at most. Now we are talking about 25 to 30 years to afford a normal house on a normal salary.

I had to sacrifice a few things in order to acquire a house cash. I chose a country with a low cost of living. I could have afforded a house in France but it would be a ruin in the middle of nowhere and I would have spent the next 5 years fixing it up myself. Here, for as annoyed as I am for having an anthill of workers around my house all day, I don’t have to do the work myself, and they should take three months at most.

 

 

Buying a house cash it not always wise.
 

My mortgage in the UK is at 2.29%. Here in Guatemala, I would have obtained a rate around 8 or 9%, even for a mortgage in US dollars. At 2.29%, I am not repaying my mortgage faster. Like I explained in this post, the average weighted interest rate on my debt load is pretty low, and I would rather have debt and invest my cash than live debt free and have nothing to invest. Of course, down the road, I hope to have no debt and a cash surplus to invest, but for now I need the passive income those investments produce.

IMG_2526

I chose to leverage that cash and channel it into several investments instead of using it to pay off debt. As I mentioned, I own some cattle, a coconut farm, a 90 acres piece of land for development, and am considering other unusual investments, but that is for another post. All those things bring me money already, or should start generating an income tomorrow, that is more than the monthly repayment on my debt. If I paid my 2.29% mortgage in full, I would have to borrow the money again to invest, and it would be considered a consumer loan, for which I expect a rate of 7%.

 

If you have some debt other than your mortgage, killing your mortgage first is probably not financially smart. Your mortgage rate should be your lowest interest debt, and if it isn’t you should look into refinancing because rates have never been so low. You could even borrow more against your mortgage to pay off your higher interest debt. Not to buy more stuff.

 

 

 

But the feeling is truly awesome.
 

I could have chosen to keep borrowing when I bought my little house in Guatemala. Although as a self employed, semi-retired foreign girl, I had virtually no chance to get an approval on a loan. It already took me four trips to the bank to open a savings account, with no overdraft, no checkbook, no credit line. Just for the privilege of lending them my cash for a 0% or 0.1% interest rate, I didn’t bother reading the fine print. Imagine a mortgage.

 

But deep down, I wanted to own the roof I live under. That is the first time in my life that I live in a paid for house. I bought my first property at 23 but it was a rental, and I was renting elsewhere for myself. In the UK, I did live in the property I bought, and enjoyed the fact that I had no landlord to tell me how to decorate or abusively keep my deposit at the end of the tenancy, but most of the property belonged to the bank.

 

As I renovate this house, and build an additional bedroom, I know everything is mine. I never have to pay rent or a mortgage again. I can build more at the pace I can afford to. For now, it is just an extra room, and I hope to have a couple more to run a 4-5 rooms guest house.

IMG_2512

That peace of mind is costing me, since I could have invested elsewhere. This is a luxury I deliberately chose to afford. And it is worth every penny.

 

Do you live in a paid for house? Is it one goal of yours or would you rather use your money for something else?",1

15-03-19,Why do I day trade?,"Since subscribing to this subreddit I have been asked why I day trade and do I also invest. I'd like to give a long winded answer to both of these questions in the hopes of helping fellow traders. 

I am not a day trading expert by any stretch of the imagination. I have been sharing my trading strategy with you all here not for profit hoping that this sub gets stronger and bigger so that we can ALL learn more. I am a small businessman and I have been in the same line of work for 27 years. I want to retire when I am 47. I started when I was 18 selling cars and now I have a nice little dealership but I am tired of this and I want something more flexible. That is how I started day trading.

I have Asperger's but I am high functioning. I have a beautiful wife and children and would be considered a successful businessman by any measure. I have an analytical mind and I see things in graphs and charts that others might not see. I am also frugal. I don't gamble and I don't take risks, although what would seem risky to others might not seem risky to me. I am not afraid to fail and lose because I have learned way more from failing and losing than I ever have from succeeding and winning. 

I keep my trading simple. My system is simple and it makes me happy to see other new traders using it to make money. Nothing makes me happier than to see fellow redditors post that they read my posts, made the same trades I made and made money. It's better than finding a dollar on the ground!

I do invest. I have several real estate holdings and I have a Roth IRA and a 401K. I have these because I was always told I had to have these. Then I read a book by Jacob Bernstein called ""The Ultimate Day Trader"". This was a plain language guide to trading that I was always looking for. I absorbed it and learned a lot. Then I read a book by Clifford Pistolese called ""Technical Analysis for the Rest of Us"" and it opened my eyes to the hard part of trading and data. Another book I read really opened my eyes. ""Candlestick Charting Demystified"" by Wayne Corbitt. What I read startled me to the core. 

I had always been told by my broker during times of turmoil in the market to ""sit back and wait. It will recover. It ALWAYS recovers"". That is a way for a broker to make sure you don't pull your money out of his account. Did you know that as of 12/11 the S&amp;P Index was at the same level as it was 12/98? That means it was at a break even level OVER A 14 YEAR PERIOD! I learned that a 20% loss of my portfolio takes a 25% gain to get back to even. A loss of 40% takes a 67% gain to get back to even. We have always been told to ""Buy and Hold"" but as Wayne Corbitt notes, it should be called ""Buy and Hope"". Those that held on and """"Hoped"" from the 2007 high to the 2009 low needed to more than DOUBLE THEIR MONEY JUST TO BREAK EVEN! 

So, that is why I started looking into day trading as a way to feel more comfortable controlling my own money. I pulled a lot of my money back from my broker and all of his fees and BS and I have been using it to make an even better return day trading. Day trading has negative connotations but those are dead wrong. An EDUCATED day trader will be more successful than a stock broker with his own money because he has skin in the game. 

I hope you take from this post that you are in control of your own destiny when you are a trader. My goal is $1000 per day, 5 days a week, 45 weeks a year. Not a shabby living. I have $50,000 in my account but you can easily make this kind of money with just $20-25K in your account. Hell, you need a cool million to buy a Subway franchise and even then, you can't clear $1000 in profit a day. And even if you did, you'd smell like a tunafish sandwich.

I see that in shorting you can typically only invest 50% of your money for required margins. But in reverse funds you can invest 100%. Shorting only allows the spread on the investment, whereas reverse funds allow for the gain. 

So why the difference? Do reverse funds devalue over time? Is there a benefit to shorting that I'm not seeing? It just seems like investing 100% of your money into a reverse fund to allow for double, triple, quadruple gains makes more sense than investing only half of your money into a short where you can only generate wealth on the spread.

I bought ORCL Call options @44.50$ for 0.63$ ea. on Friday the 13th. At the time ORCL was trading at 41.54$

Oracle Corp. released its fiscal third-quarter earnings report on the 17th. The stock went up 1.66% AMC and was ranging between 2.30% and 4.5% on the 18th. I knew this would happen, however, Options were doing the exact opposite.

Check: https://cldup.com/PjdpSnyMkh.png

ORCL Call options @44.50$ went from 0.63$ to 0.35$.. How is that possible? In my mind, when a stock goes up the Options are going up too (it's linear). It's quite surprising since Calls and Puts went down..

15-03-18,"Need to dump my 3yr old Roth IRA and convert the proceeds to EUR to pay for tuition by late August. What's the best timeline to accomplish this?","I'm a year out of college and I started a Roth 3 years ago and have been contributing the max amount each year. I'm going to grad school in France this fall and need to use this chunk of money to pay for tuition. 

I considered holding my stocks and getting a loan but I'm being quoted 9-15% due to this being a foreign school and I'm not a US citizen. The downside is I'm losing a few years of Roth contribution which could mean a chunk of missed tax-free gains by the time I take out the money when I'm retired. But in the end I decided to sell my Roth and use the money  -- not too big of a big loss in terms of opportunity cost in my opinion since once I graduate I can make back my tuition relatively quickly and put that money to work. My rationality isn't 100% airtight but I don't have any other source of funds right now and I don't really want to deal with loans. 

My portfolio has 6 stocks not really diversified by any means. They are all stocks picked with momentum/value in mind and I did 2 or 3 trades after inception to swap out some names. They are equal weighted and I have a heavy tilt in tech/hardware (WDC, SYMC, NCR, GLW, a small holding in LVNTA from LINTA now QVCA's restructuring, which I sold out of). I have one 2x holding in MO as a defensive pick, which ironically did the best the last year. 

I personally foresee a lot of volatility coming in the next couple months and I'm not sure whether it's going to move in a direction that benefits my long portfolio. I had an idea to reduce holdings for a while but now with tuition liabilities I going to commit to selling the max amount I can take out, which is the contributions part. I have about 20-30% gains and I can't take out that chunk right now so I will keep a name that I will hold for the long run. I'm leaning toward NCR since I just brought this one in and I have a thesis I'm comfortable with for this stock. The other ones I'm holding are all hovering around all time highs and I don't have enough time to reevaluate them since I'm going to be traveling.

I want to stock up on EUR once I get funds from selling stocks. I'm starting to do a bit in small increments but I'm not sure what the best time to do it is. I opened up an EverBank account that holds foreign currencies and transferred about a quarter of my tuition with the cash I currently hold outside of my Roth. I was gonna buy some EUR yesterday but my funds weren't settled yet. Now after today's move I'm thinking of holding off for a while. I still am a big believer in EURUSD parity despite today's move so I hope that pans out some time soon. If you have any advice to counter against this I'd be happy to hear you out.

I was pretty naive (still am, frankly) at the time about finances so I pretty much just trusted what he recommended. 

I opened a Roth with Edward Jones and invested in this FTCLX mutual fund. I contributed to the fund for probably around 5 years before I started taking a more active interest in managing my finances. 

Thanks to this subreddit and other online info I learned a lot about FTCLX. I learned that its expense ratio of 1.84% was absurdly high, and that it had a low but frustrating back end load. I decided to move the Roth to an eTrade account and buy an ETF.

I made the change and bought SPY in fall 2012. [SPY has outperformed FTCLX by 21.4% over the past 5 years](http://i.imgur.com/IqqzXTB.png).

For the last four months my friend and I have been heads down building this app.  I love investing, learning about public companies and discovering all things finance related.  However, for whatever reason, I’ve noticed that most brokerage apps -- and finance apps as a whole -- are pretty bad in the App Store.  I got so fed up with using them that I decided to create my own.

The app is completely free, no advertisements and requires no account (and hence no personally identifiable information).  Some neat things we do:

* Calculate your portfolio’s performance every minute so when you open the app you can at a glance see how your portfolio has done throughout the day relative to the markets.
* Push Notifications for intraday price movements (customizable!)
* Send you a push notification after market close telling you how your portfolio did relative to the DOW, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq.
* Send you push notifications about earnings dates (one week reminders) as well as the reports themselves.
* We have after hours charts -- something I haven't found in many apps.  

I'm looking for advice and feedback.  I'd love to know what you all think!

Not sure if this site is really conductive to this kind of thing, but here goes.  Seems I can't put images into the post, which hurts.  But I'm gonna try with the links and see how it goes over.

BRK.B looks pretty nice and healthy. Always good to see something consolidating calmly in the context of a steady uptrend, particularly if the rising 200 MA is coming to possibly act as support and give it a further nudge higher.

[$BRK.B daily chart analysis](http://i.imgur.com/DqnbHPv.png)

[$BRK.B Weekly chart analysis](http://i.imgur.com/cg5wusS.png)

BRK is basically a big fund.  Lots of different companies under one roof.  A decent proxy for the economy or broad market.  I’m a bit surprised to see it seemingly underperforming the SPX (S&amp;P500).  At least on this view.  

[$BRK.B/$SPX price comparison](http://i.imgur.com/3Yvw81E.png)

The following is a percentage comparison chart starting in the beginning of 2012 shortly after the market and BRK found a bottom and started a new rally.  I would say this points toward a possible consolidation period as it has outpaced the market pretty significantly over the last year.  
[$BRK.B/$SPX price comparison](http://i.imgur.com/3Yvw81E.png)

As always, and particularly with a big conglomerate like Berkshire, we have to look at everything in the context of what the market on whole is doing.  Taking just a big picture look using weekly candles and a 5 year chart, it’s clear the market has been in a pretty nice bull market for a long time now.  But the steady climb seems to be waning a bit.  It’s still in an uptrend with higher highs and higher lows, but just barely making those defining moments.  (Uptrend = higher highs and higher lows, downtrend = lower highs and lower lows.  This is an objective way to analyze trend on any time frame.)  Notice how over the last 4-5 months, it has been bouncing around in a fairly tight range, trying and sort squeezing higher, but mostly peeking it’s head higher and then barely following through if it all.  Not the biggest weekly volume spike from mid December when there was a big range and it tried to burst higher.  Peeked above, but didn’t make it.  Since then it’s been mostly grinding sideways.  Got a touch above that resistance level and then didn’t quite keep it.  Now testing that same resistance level.  
[$SPY weekly chart](http://i.imgur.com/vT1bg38.png)

Also noteworthy on that SPY chart is the “bearish divergence” seen between the equal or higher highs and lows in price, while the momentum indicators below are showing lower peaks.  That shows waning momentum under the hood.  

Nasdaq looks stronger on whole, but I would argue the momentum in the big picture is also waning.  
[$QQQ weekly chart](http://i.imgur.com/Qtt58Pp.png)

I always like to see the Russell 2000 trying to lead the big boys.  But it’s been such a wild card.  The last year was a big wide sideways range while the big indexes were marching higher.  And then it broke down below that range before rallying though it.  This latest surge since November or so just seems a bit imbalanced.  And we can see a bearish divergence between the surge in price and trickle off in volume on the IWM.  Of course, it’s not the true volume of the actual index, but this heavily traded ETF is a pretty good proxy, I’d say.  
[$IWM weekly chart](http://i.imgur.com/VW41ijq.png)

My take away, big picture?  If the crowd is buying, go with the flow.  But be nimble and proceed with caution.  Someday soon, I think, something will come to frighten the crowd.  Once they get truly spooked, it will then happen easier and perhaps more often.  If that happens, the resulting sideways range will then eventually break down.  That’s how tops are formed and broken.
Yesterday the market rallied big on the news of the FOMC shifting to perhaps a later date and less aggressive plan for raising rates.  (Or something like that.)  Big movement higher and big volume.  Today there was no follow through.  We’ll see if the coming days shine a better light on that reaction.

If some unforeseen circumstances caused a great drop in price with no hope of coming back in the coming weeks or months (but almost assuredly over the course of years) and I then switched from a short-term strategy to a long-term investment in that particular stock, what would this be called?

For example, I buy 100 shares of AAPL and whenever it goes up by a few dollars I sell and make a few hundred bucks.  BUT, in the very rare case that there's some bad news or major economic event and Apple's stock drops 30 or 40 bucks, I just hold it as a long-term investment, knowing that it will likely produce returns over the long-haul (as it has historically).

Would having a large bankroll and only picking stocks I would be comfortable holding as long-term investments insulate me from risk in day-trading?  Since the worst-case scenarios would just shift my goal from short-term profits to long-term investments?  Is there a name for this style of trading?",4
15-03-20,Noob question: What caused the share price of Apple (AAPL) to drop really sharply during the final 11 minutes of trading today?,"I apologize if this is a dumb question.

Apple was trading relatively normal/flat today until around 3:49 it spiked in volume and went sharply down (especially in the last 2 minutes of trading) from around $127.75 to $125.90.
[http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL)

Was there some breaking news I'm missing that caused this (I couldn't find anything)?

Does it have something to do with today being options expiration day, and some kind of market manipulation going on?  Like institutional or algorithm trading with really deep pockets selling off massive shares to suddenly push it down to hit a target strike price at expiration?",6

15-03-20,Fed report suggests US stock market is overvalued by two sigma. (link to report),"Abstract:
One of the missions of the Office of Financial Research is to analyze asset market valuations
and if there are excesses, explore the potential financial stability ramifications of a sharp
correction. The author argues that U.S. stock prices today appear high by historical standards.
Although he notes that the financial stability implications of a market correction could be
moderate due to limited liquidity transformation in equity markets, he addresses other
financial stability issues that may be more relevant, such as leverage, compressed pricing of
risk, interconnectedness, and complexity.

I am trying to succeed in business and online stock, and learn investing. I am telling and asking this because I became interested in business and investing from watching documentaries of business people getting wealthy by simply playing a game of risks and rewards. To me I feel like I don't need college to get a high paying job and be wealthy.College is getting expensive and in the long term could hurt me financially so I have to be smart and improvise to find another way to be wealthy.


As a beginner in the business world what books should I buy from Barnes and nobles that will help me start off and learn the basics to where I get an understanding a lot more(does not matter will read them all the books that you guys suggest!) ? Which authors should I follow and which investors/businessmen will relate to me? How does business and investing work in the beginning and what should I look out for? How can I be strategic in the stock game and earn lots of money?

I have an app that tells me what going on in the business world called marketwatch. I use yahoo to read stocks. I will be writing down on paper and pen every info that will help me succeed and be wealthy. I am determined and confident with this. I also would like some help and info on getting an internship in business/investing companies. I also would have put some personal things like age and wage of my work so the kind redditors can get an understanding at where I am at but reddit does not allow us to put personal things.

Bank of Nova Scotia 13% - Solid dividend and I love how they have positioned themselves with cineplex and the nhl for the younger crowd.

Bank of montreal 13% - solid dividend, gives some diversity to my finance picks, have positioned themselves in mls soccer which appears to be growing rapidly in canada.

Bell 13% - best dividends, solid company for ages, are rapidly expanding there infrastructure using fiber optics which is the forseeable future, has a duopoly in canada with rogers

Telus 13% - my favourite of the big 3 telecom companies in canada

Huskey 13% - great dividend payments solid company to weather the oil crisis, i want some exposure to oil since i personally believe $40 is the low and if it drops lower wont be for long. With the us running out of storage capacity production will have to be cut which should drive the price up.

Spartan energy 13% - a trusted friend told me it was a good solid company to invest in for exposure to oil. Financials look good

West jet 13% - strong company low pe, looks like they have a good strategy for expansion and future growth.

15-03-20,"ETF's that don't pay dividends","
No matter how much I’ve searched, I’ve been unable to find this answer anywhere. 

I’m trying to figure out one thing, 2 parts

How do ETF’s get their actual value? 
- Is it based on what people are willing to pay for it OR
- Is it based on adding up all the shares the ETF owns, and then dividing that total value by the # of shares that are out there?

If I have an ETF that holds 50 companies of varying weight, and the ETF is $10 today, how is that # determined? 



The 2nd part is regarding dividends. If I have ETF’s that don’t pay out dividends, but does hold at least one asset that does, how are the dividends paid to the ETF reinvested, and how does that affect the calculation above? 

I’m trying to wrap my head around this. My thinking is there should be an ever growing gap between the market price for the underlying stocks in an ETF, and the ETF itself that reinvests dividends. This is because the underlying assets are paying out dividends, which impact the ROI, but drain on the stock price itself. The ETF however is taking the dividend ROI and adding it to the stock price movement as well.

15-03-20,"Strattec Securities, an underpriced small cap growth stock? STRT","Strattec securities (STRT) sells locks and other mechanical components for cars.  In October the stock jumped on earnings because of a surprise one-time large sale to GM, resulting in record sales.  However, in early December, STRT announced that Chysler would be halting an assembly in Canada, cutting sales to Chrysler by 15-17million.  The stock plummeted 40% to ~60.  The chart shows a strong long-term resistence at 60, and did not fall further.  Since then, it has recovered ~13% to ~70.

The market cap is only ~250million, but they control a pretty niche market.  Despite their size, STRT has a dividend of 0.69% and a payout ratio of 6.73%.  The small payout ratio leaves room for a dividend raise is profits continue to rise.

I believe that STRT has much more room to recover.  The Chrysler shut down is temporary, and sales will return.  Additionally, according to (what I think to be) low FY15 Q1 and Q2 estimates, STRT's revenues will be up almost 15% Y/Y, and EPS will be up 43% Y/Y.  

The valuation is low, all the ratios show undervaluation except for P/B, which is 1.81.  The P/E is 10.3, historically low for the company.  P/S is 0.62.  Current ratio is 2.12. D/E is 0.03. 

The balance sheet is also strong, the MRQ showing almost 20 million cash and only 3.5 million in debt.  The majority of liabilities are current, and there is enough current assets to pay double the current liabilities.

Despite all that, I see a few potential problems or red flags.  
Inventories have been climbing for the past four quarters, despite increasing sales.  Also, the net change in cash for FY15 Q2 was a negative ~2.5 million, mostly due to increased capex. Without the large sale from GM again, and with the loss from Chrysler, next quarter's sales will probably be lower, which could hurt the stock price.  Lastly, auto purchases have fallen 2.97% since November 2014. 

Overall I like the company, especially the growth and its niche market.  Before I decide to buy or not, I will do more research on why estimates are so low for the next two quarters.  So, read the article on Seeking alpha (which introduced me to this), and give post any thoughts.

When the stock broke 1 (and might i add it lasted for 3 days over 1 then it fell back), he made it his job to reply to me and say: 

&gt;Sup dude,
Just wanted to update you on DSKX. Since you told me it is not a gem (""as much as ECRY is"" were your words), it is up 50%. Just saying

I pretty much replied it was gambling from this point on and it has a 50-50 shot of going up or down. He replied with this:

&gt;Not a gamble. This thing has legitimate legs. If you had a few extra years of experience you'd realize that it's worth some legitimate analysis

15-03-23,"For the purpose of achieving FI, would you use your tax return to buy stock that is sure to grow but has a 1.5% dividend (Apple), or recently stagnant stock with about 7% dividend (AT&amp;T)?(x-post)","My understanding is that capital gains are cool, but they basically only give you the opportunity to grow your cash, sell the asset, and that leaves you with stagnant cash...to spend, or reinvest. For someone seeking financial independence, capital gains seems like a means to an end (investing the cash again), and not the end itself.

So therefore my understanding is that 'dividends are better' re: financial independence. AT&amp;T has powerful dividends that have consistently grown, but AT&amp;T's share worth has been stagnating. Apple's share worth is growing and will probably grow more with the Apple watch (and car?) coming out, but their dividends are a little on the low side. Both are $1.88/year. AT&amp;T's stock is about $33/share, Apple $150/share.

I realize this sounds like something for /r/stocks but my particular end is financial independence and not just a big payout when I decide to stop working.

My $738 return would allow me to have 5 Apple shares ($9.40/yr dividends) or 22 shares of AT&amp;T ($41.36/yr).

Details: I'm 24, an actor, into investing, use a platform that lets me trade for free. I make less than $1k a month after taxes and my rent is half that; net worth still relatively growing. Seriously considering the real estate agent path and looking at firms with good cuts for agents.

Then i have sold some land which gave me a solid 50K capital ,gave all of it as a private loan and got around 70K 2 years later.
I have invested this capital and now i practice day trading /spot trading earning 5-10 pips min. per trade,my biggest loss was around 40 pips.I do use a high risk strategy,i do use expert advisors and some available brokers here and there.
Predicted the euro ""fall"" nearly one year before that happened and invested usually in the eur/usd, chf/eur and the russian rbl.My profit was about 30K within 6 months( i do use a levereage from 1:50-1:100),my ultimate goal is to become a millionaire as soon as i can , and started investing in some tech ,and in loans.

My understanding is that, structure wise, I'd be an equity partner in a new LLC which would be doing business under basically the same name as the other location. The founder/""active manager"" would hold a 30% share with equity investors splitting the other 70%. I'd probably end up owning 2.5-5%, depending on what I end up investing. They estimate that the principal + modest interest would be paid back to the investors in the first six years (""accelerated disbursements"") after which point the active manager would start taking his cut as well. Projected revenue after year six is about a quarter of the total equity being raised.

15-03-23,Kairos and the Art of Timing in Investment.,"Kairos and the Art of Timing in Investment

Time is the key to investing success. Time imbues value but more importantly it shapes markets. markets move to the dance of time. So investing is about building up a sense of time. Equally, it is about developing a sense of timing.

Kairos (καιρός) is the ancient Greek word meaning the right or opportune moment (the supreme moment). The ancient Greeks had two words for time, chronos and kairos. While the former refers to chronological or sequential time, the latter signifies a time lapse, a moment of indeterminate time in which everything happens. Kairos is the investors art. The moment when everything happens.

Using kairos to inform investment decisions is, in one dimension, about moments when markets move up or down. There is of course another dimension: waiting for the opportune moment to seize an opportunity. Mostly such opportune moments are about judgement and instinct, but some moments in time are easy to predict. For example, anniversaries. Timing investment or divestment to coincide with a particular anniversary is a relative simple plan to make, as long as you keep your eyes open.

This year for example marks the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo. A great opportunity for military collectibles of that era.

Bonhams is holding an auction to mark the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, entitled 'Wellington, Waterloo and the Napoleonic Wars', on 1 April.

A highlight among the 160 items offered in the auction is a sword used at Waterloo by Lieutenant General Cook, which is estimated at £15,000-20,000. The men under Cook's command were involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the day and the Lt. Gen. himself lost an arm. Equipment used at Waterloo is now very scarce and this is a particularly fine example. Another highlight will be the huge panoramic painting of the end of the battle depicting the moment when the victorious Generals, Wellington and Blücher, met outside Napoleon's headquarters. This is a version of the famous painting which now hangs in the House of Lords and is estimated at £10,000-15,000.

An eye witness letter written by Captain Charles Best shortly after the end of the battle, which provides a dramatic account of the fighting and of Wellington's coolness under fire at the Battle of Quatre Bras, will be offered with an estimate of £2,000-4,000. It reads: 'Our brave Duke was everywhere and I had an opportunity of seeing how little he was concerned for his Safety, he was sitting ... writing an Order with a pencil on his knee, when a Cannon ball struck the ground close by him, and covered him with earth, he looked very cooly to where the ball had struck, shook of[f] the earth, and continued to write his order.'

An 18 carat gold box belonging to the Earl of Uxbridge, who fought alongside Wellington at Waterloo, is estimated at £50,000-70,000. On losing his leg to a cannon shot, the Earl is alleged to have said, 'By God, Sir, I've lost my leg!' to which Wellington replied, 'By God Sir so you have!' Another important item is a very rare presentation sword from the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, at which Napoleon was decisively defeated by forces under the command of the Russian Tsar Alexander I. The defeat resulted in Napoleon's abdication the following year and his exile to Elba. The sword carries an estimate of £35,000–45,000.

All the items in the sale will be on display at Bonhams from 23 March until the day of the auction.

Writing in the latest edition of Bonhams Magazine, Jane Wellesley, a direct descendent of the Duke of Wellington, gave a vivid description of her ancestor at the battle: 'On the day, his presence on the battleground was electrifying, as he galloped from one scene of action to another, giving orders, rallying and reassuring his men. In life, as on the battlefield, he rarely let go of the reins. Today Wellington might be described as a control freak.'

Jon Baddeley, Managing Director of Bonhams Knightsbridge, said: 'The Battle of Waterloo is one of the most significant military encounters of the 19th century and the outcome had a profound effect on the future of Europe. There will be huge public interest in the 200th anniversary of the battle next June and the sale at Bonhams will provide a focal point for the many collectors fascinated by this important and absorbing period of history.'

So the 200th anniversary of Waterloo is upon us. This year also marks 600th anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt. Neither went that well for the French and both remind us that success in life, battles and investment comes down to kairos!",0

About 5 or 6 years ago when Gold was selling around $1600 + an ounce I made a rash of bad investments in buying gold coins and further compounded it by investing in seveal Gold/Precious Materials Mutual Funds and ETF's such as SLV, GLD, IAU etc. The long and short of it is I have something like $75K invested in this area. I think the present value of this investment is soemthing like $40K if not less. 

I would like your advice on how I should go about dumping all these investments. I think I will hold on to the gold coins for a little while but sell of all the mutual funds (about $20K worth) and take the losses - else I will end up paying yearly fund expenses which is like sending good money after bad. And then dispose of ETF's...may be sell of the coins after abour a year or so. What are your suggestions. I am not a good investor and typically I have lost money in stocks but never this badly in Gold/related because I was thinking like Midas :( and pumped in a lot of money when I saw the prices of Gold climbing steadily seveal years ago. Please treat me like the fool I am and give me any and all advice - no matter how basic it is. Thanks for your time.

15-03-24,Question about a company buying a non-stock company,"Hey guys,

I work for a company (company A) that was bought out last year by a very large medical company (company B). They are both medical, but different fields. Company A still runs under its own name; you wouldn't even know they were related. (Like McDonalds buying Kroger or something).Company A does not have stock, but company B does. I believe in company A and they have plans to grow double in size across the US by the end of this year and increase in size in each year going forward until they aren't able to anymore. I believe my company will be worth a lot more in years to come.

Here's my question...since company A is now owned by company B, these profits in the long run will essentially raise company B's stock right?

I'm sorry if this is confusing, I don't know if I'm allowed to say names or not, I don't believe it's insider information, but I'm still iffy on some of the stock laws.

Edit: If it helps, Company B is Fresenius Medical Care (FMS)",1
15-03-23,"Parents started accounts for me when I was younger, and now it is time for me to take an active role over them. Would appreciate advice and help.","So I am in the very fortunate position that my position that my parents started putting away investments for me when I was young. There are 3 accounts:Roth IRA with Schwab, a simple IRA with Transamerica, and a mutual fund with Hartford funds.

Now that I am out of college I figured it was time to meet with the guy who set up and advised my parents what to invest in. My appointment is tomorrow.

Besides finding out if he is a fee bases or commission based advisor, I am not sure which questions to ask him. I just started acquainting myself with finance a couple of months ago.

I probably won't be able to contribute to these accounts for awhile, building my emergency fund at the moment (which stands around $7000), and also my job doesn't pay that well (hopefully I find more lucrative employment in the upcoming years). I am debt free besides the statement balance on my credit cards that I pay off every month.

Here is the breakdown of my accounts

Schwab: 
GFAFX: American Funds The Growth Fund of America® Class F-1
CAMOX: Cambiar Opportunity Fund Class Investor
DODGX:Dodge &amp; Cox Stock Fund

TransAmerica:
Transamerica Asset Allocation Growth Portfolio Class A

HartfordFunds: 
ITBAX: The Hartford Total Return Bond Fund Class A

So any advice on the how these accounts are set up are appreciated. I have heard bond funds are not the greatest so I am worried about the money in HartfordFunds. I have talked to a representative from TransAmerica and they said an option for me was to roll that in a Roth IRA. Should I do this?

I didn't. Give out values of each account, but I can if that helps. The value of all 3 accounts is over $80,000, and so I am being very cautious before I do anything so as not to screw this up.

Thanks for your help.

15-03-24,SONIC Earnings,"Earnings is tomorrow AMC.

Recently it's had a run up because of several analyst upgrades during the first few days of March. A week later, there was a ton of insider selling. 

Analysts estimate EPS of 0.12 with revenues of 124 million. 30 days ago before the upgrades estimates averaged 0.11, and 60 days ago they averaged 0.10. 

Sonic beat earnings last quarter. All of these factors have produced a pretty lofty stock price. The valuation is relatively high as well. The stock has been on an uptrend since even before last fall's shenanigans.

Since the stock has had such a massive run up, the downside is likely limited. Sentiment is also high from analyst upgrades. Several directors sold a week prior to earnings and a week after the upgrades. If they do beat earnings I doubt that they would beat by much. If they miss earnings, the repercussions would probably be more drastic.

Of course, this is all blatant speculation, but I am actually considering buying some puts. After all, this is the YOLO subreddit.

I'm in agreement since Net Income (main component of EPS) can be somewhat more easily manipulated and doesn't really show how *efficiently* a company is at generating returns. Simply having an increase in EPS doesn't tell me much, as that money can be earning 2% in a savings account somewhere when it could be better invested (or returned).

However, the part in the book that tripped me up was Hagstrom seemed to indicate that EPS also includes Retained Earnings, which doesn't seem true to me? I could have misread something, but I was a bit confused because I thought EPS was just NI/# of shares and had no inclusion of Retained Earnings.

I am not asking for investment advice.  I am just wondering how investors trust people they might select as a shepherd of their funds.  I ask this question because I recently started watching a show called ""American Greed,"" since I've started I have not seen one repeat (meaning there are so many shows, the shows never run out).

Show after show of investment fund managers, and others, who trick others into investing and ultimately the investor gets fooled out of his money in the millions.

The schemes seem to go on for years, in some cases.  Some of the managers were touted in the major investment magazines and on TV shows.  The program has altered my view of investing.  One show you saw people like Diane Sawyer, and many other recognizable names as victims.

15-03-23,Need help choosing a new Broker,"So for the longest Ive had Zecco as my broker which at the time was great because it was like $7 per trade and no hidden fees. Now they have transitioned to Tradeking and they have made it completely unavailable to trade the stock that I work with: ""NTLK"". Currently the stock sits at $0.015 and I cannot sell or buy anymore with them and I would like to move them elsewhere. I am currently looking for a Broker that doesn't hassle with inactivity fees or per/share fees because I don't trade so much and it would be a pain to pay per share. I looked into OptionXpress and it seemed like a good option because they are able to trade that share however they were unable to accept the transfer of stocks between Tradeking and them so I would have the 5000 shares I have stuck with Tradeking. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

15-03-23,"CMV: Day Trading is a Horrible, Horrible way of making Money","Tl;DR, I believe that day trading is a terrible thing for investors due to the risk of loss.  I would like to hear an interesting counter-point that says that day trading is good. Long read below

Whereas speculation usually can lead to short-term loss over a period of months for the uninformed investor, day trading can accelerate said loss.  Akin to investing into a casino, day trading can allow one to earn double their value within minutes.  However, losing can cause one to become bankrupt without the ability to earn rewards points and sleep in a deluxe hotel, eating away at a comfortable buffet. 
Below is an equation that shows how day trading works

Day +/-$= $A(R)+$B(R)+$C(R)…………

The amount of money that an individual makes per day in day trading (Day +/- $) is the result of adding up all of the trades that the individual has made per day (A,B,C….), with the percentage of return from pulling out (R).  For example, with the first trade of the day (A(R)), an individual invested $10,000.  

When pulling out, said individual broke even, meaning that the resulting equation is ($10,000(1)).  In another example, when investing that same $10,000 into a second stock, the individual gained $1,000; and therefore, the individual would have ($10,000(1.1)) for his second investment.  In the third investment, the individual lost $1,000; and therefore, the individual would have ($10,000(0.9)) for his third investment. 

To consider the profit or loss one can have as a day trader, an example story can be used.  The example day trader (named Norm in the example) sets a goal to earn an average of $500 per trading day; and from the 260 trading days per year (in a non leap-year), Norm expects to make a pre-tax-and-expenses income of $130,000 per year. Through a set of twenty trades (at an average profit of $25 per trade), Norm aims to make his $500. 

For each trades Norm makes, the day trade brokerage charges a commission fee of $10, meaning that Norm must make a profit of $700 per day to earn his $500.  Per trade, Norm must average $35 in profit; and since the trading day on the New York Stock Exchange runs for a period of 6.5 hours, Norm must make one-trade every twenty minutes.  Per trade, Norm invests 3,500 shares into a company with the expectation that an increase of one cent per share will lead to his goal of $35-profit-per-trade.

On November 28, 2014, Facebook opened at 9:30 a.m. at $77.69.  Norm invested 3,500 shares, $271,915 in economic value, into the company. At 9:55, the stock dropped to $77.30, meaning that had Norm pulled out, he would have lost $1,375, with $1,365 from the initial loss of Facebook’s stock, along with the $10 in commission for trading with the online day-trader.   Moving on from his first loss of the day, Norm must now make $2,075 over the next nineteen trades to reach his goal, averaging $109.21 per trade. Next, at 10:00 a.m., Norm invests 3,500 shares into Pioneer Natural Resources at $177.65 per share, $621,775 in economic value. At 10:30 a.m., Pioneer Natural Resources share price is at $176.82; and if Norm pulls out, Norm loses $2,915.  Here, to make up for the losses he has so far incurred, Norm must now average $200.28 over the next eighteen trades. 

Finally, Norm at 10:30 a.m. puts 3,500 shares into Boeing, whose share price is $135.14 per share, with a market value of $472,990. At 11:00 a.m., Norm pulls his Boeing stock out at $135.02 per share, meaning that Norm lost $430 in thirty minutes by investing into a purported blue-chip company such as Boeing.  Here, Norm quits for the day, having lost $4,720 in ninety minutes. In this example, Norm invested his money into stocks regardless if the stock was speculative, resourceful, or of blue-chip criteria. In the short-term, any stock can lose money, regardless of their fundamentals, popularity, or external factors. 

The risk of day trading for the average individual can be seen through the dot-com bubble.  Through a combination of innovative technology with speculative stocks, a new generation of day traders was created. Many of these day-traders were entrepreneurial at heart, looking to leave their jobs in search of making money without having an employer guiding them. Many of these day traders, they were of an older America, ones in their forties-through-sixties. 

While some of these individuals grew up in the Great Depression, few of these entrepreneurs believed that effects similar to the Stock Market Crash of 1929 would never happen to them. To these entrepreneurial day-traders, the development of the computer was the revolutionary technology that leveled out the playing field for the average individual. 

However, what separates the average individual from Goldman Sachs, as an example, is both experience and technology. The average American that quit their jobs to become a day trader during the dot-com era rarely had any experience in the investment field, only becoming aware of investment when said investment had rapidly entered the television and internet market. 

These aspiring trades had little – if any – knowledge on basic concepts, such as a balance sheet, income statement, or the ability to understand the company itself that they were investing into. Many of these amateur day traders learned their business knowledge from CNBC, CNNfn, and Bloomberg.  In these cases, nearly every analysts, interviewee, and expert in the field of business and investment had been overly optimistic about the market when interviewed by financial news networks, echoing many others that believed that the growth was infinite. 

By being heavily influenced by the men and women of media, the average day trader would buy stocks on the words of others.  Consequently, these stocks that were purchased often were speculative and emerging, such as Amazon and eBay. Because these stocks were considered popular, networks such as CNBC would encourage individuals to buy stocks into these companies; and thus a cycle was created where the unenlightened individual would invest into speculation.  

This is comparable to the knowledge and experience that companies, such as Morgan Stanley, possess. With these large firms, hundreds of employees are hired for the sole purpose of researching stocks.  Whether these stocks involve old-fashioned long-and-short, futures, and/or derivatives, individuals are paid to research specifics.  With hundreds of employees employing research for the company, large firms have an advantage that day traders do not:  the numbers-and-knowledge game. 

Even if a day trader had decades of knowledge in the business market behind them, unless the day trader possesses technology that possesses the capability of trading almost-instantaneously, said day trader will have a tough time competing with today’s firms.  Through the development of fiber optic cables from Spread Networks, many firms, such as Goldman Sachs, have been able to trade at a faster rate, meaning that within milliseconds of a trade, said firm can possess shares at a better price. 

This millisecond-trade is comparable to the average day trader, who usually views stock quotes up to a fifteen minute delay, along with purchasing stocks that that seconds of processing; for while the Internet is comparatively faster today than it was in 1999,  the process of hitting the “Submit” button, transmitting the information to the online brokerage firm, and then submitting the order, takes seconds. Thus, while an individual day trader may have been able to purchase a stock at $74.50, the large firm at the same time could have purchased stock at $74.45 per share. 

 Even before-and-during the dot-com bubble, the technological advantage still remained with large firms.  By limiting access of viewing real-time quotes before the mid-1990’s, firms could earn extra commission by waiting until the price of a share rose slightly (usually by a couple of pennies) before transacting the deal. After investigations from both the Department of Justice and SEC put a kibosh to these schemes, day trading grew, thanks in large part to day trading firms introducing real-time quotes for their customers, thereby giving the impression of fair game.  

However, by taking advantage of the technology of the internet, day trading firms could handle the traders of the late-1990’s who often trades dozens of times per day, thereby giving these firms a large amount of commission from the same individual.  Regardless of time period, the large firm possesses a technological advantage due to possessing the money needed to produce said resources.

With the amalgamation of these two factors, an individual who attempted to day trade in the 1990’s usually lost money.  In Chicago, for example, a waiter was given a $200,000 inheritance.  With no experience in the investment market, the waiter entered the day trading business, losing the entire inheritance.  In California, reflective of the spirit of prospective day traders, a bank employee quit, having borrowed $40,000 on credit cards.  In short time, said former banker lost his borrowed money, in addition to his job.  In Boston, an elderly man lost $250,000 of his wife’s savings in a few hours through day trading. The stress of losing money in day trading led to Mark Orrin Barton killing thirteen (including himself, his wife, and two children) individuals, mostly at two Atlanta, Georgia day trading firms .  

The tragedy of these case studies, apart from the even more tragic-and-unnecessary loss of life in the Barton example, is that each of these individuals were of the middle-class variety, having saved their life savings through years of hard work.  While it may have been possible that each individual realized the risk of day trading, these hard-working citizens probably did not realize the possibility that within hours, their entire investment could be wiped out through both commissions and fluctuation of the market. More so is the fact that the day trader’s reliance on analysts in the media market would cost a fortune in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble bursting. 
	 
Looking at the analysis of day trading, speculation only benefits the elite, with the term “elite” used to describe the largest investment firms in the world.  These firms have the fiscal resources to obtain both the physical and technology needed to succeeed in the highly speculative world of day trading.  The employment of hundreds of physical individuals for the sole purpose of research specific stocks is an indicator of the firms willingness to limit risk.  With the ability to purchase cables that will speed up the purchasing of stock, these firms possess an advantage that the average day trader does not.

15-03-23,Leverage Car Equity to Invest? (X-Post from /r/PersonalFinance),"Wife and I each have paid off cars and I was doing the math of what would happen if we refinance cash-out with DCU.org to get a 1.49% rate. Compare this to investing in a Roth IRA/401k which has historically given a 7-9% return over the long term.

In total we could probably get $15k equity out of the two cars over maybe a 3 year term.

In the first year with $15k the interest at 1.49% would cost $224 and the gains at 7% would be $1200 giving a net $977. Then over year 2 and 3 with a smaller balance we'd get about another $700 for $1700 profit over the course of the loans. Cash flow is not a problem at all, we save about a third of our paychecks.

7% return from investing is just a long term figure and it is in retirement funds so I am not worried about a short term market dip just trying to maximize efficiency over the long term. Sounds like a good plan?",4

15-03-23,Tax Loss Harvesting and Wash Sales,"I've been playing around with wealthfront and I have a few questions about the process.

First off, I'm a bit confused about the maximums of tax loss harvesting. It seems that you can deduct an unlimited amount of losses against your year's capital gains, and up to $3000 against ordinary income. Does that mean that if you made money investing, you can deduct as much losses as you have against those games, and if your losses &gt; gains, you can deduct up to 3k against your ordinary income?

Also, I'm thinking of switching from wealthfront to betterment. If I liquidate my wealthfront account, then put it all in betterment, which uses the same ETFs, will that trigger wash sales? And if so, is it a big deal? I understand I won't be able to deduct those losses, but are there any penalties aside from adjusting the cost basis? Is there a better way to switch from wealthfront to betterment (with TLH enabled)?

15-03-24,How to measure investment in businesses,"I'm trying to create some metrics for measuring multiple investments in multiple small businesses.  In essence, I'd like to create a dashboard if you will that combines all the investments into a single portfolio, however I'm not sure how to go about doing this.  A reasonable equation I found was for Return on Invested Capital:
((1-tax rate)(EBIT))/((Assets-cash)-(non-interest bearing current liabilities)

My only issue is that I don't feel comfortable that this is capturing the pro rata share of each investment and I'm not positive how you'd combine these to show the performance of a portfolio as a whole.  Would I multiply each ROIC by the equity percentage?  Would that also act to weigh the results on more invested projects than others?",28

I'm pretty young and really in the process of getting my feet wet in the market. I have taken a few classes on the stock market and investing in the past but most of my research has been on my own.

Recently I have been trying to read up on various sites (and sometimes on here) and just can not seem to find any sources that I like and seem trustworthy or wise. For every piece of analysis or advice there is another voice contradicting them. Most information that I find just feels like a used car salesman trying to either justify their own portfolio or try to sell me something.

Of course there is no definitive source for knowledge because if there was we would all be rich. All I am looking for is a site or forum with unbiased fact based analysis of the market.

For now I have literally just been ignoring 90% of what I am finding online when normally the internet is a wealth of free knowledge for almost every topic. I have just been trying to use my own logic and what I have learned from school along with the news to try to look at macro trends.  Problem is anytime I think I am making a solid investment I can find a hundred people that will tell me I'm wrong (and vice versa).

Daytrade specific.
-
I short intraday. It is (in my opinion) the most fun style of trading. If i were you i would stay away from pennystocks until you have a good understanding of stockpromotion and short squeezes. If you want to do well in daytrading you should record each trade and write down where you want to get out of a stock (pretty much a mental stoploss).
Shorting intraday is not easy, you have to adapt and be ready to understand when to get into and out of a stock. Here is trade I made a few weeks back: http://i.imgur.com/aMU43pI.png?1 As you can see, I had gotten in with a set idea when I wanted to get out. I shorted because I felt the momentum has shifted and I looked for a opportunity to get in. This is in my opinion the most important aspect in a daytrader (or someone that shorts in general)

Also i use suretrader which bypasses the pattern daytrade rule. I think they have a good short list too (except for gene, rip)

And the scan i use (the basic version): http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=311&amp;f=sh_curvol_o50,sh_price_u15,ta_highlow20d_nh,ta_perf2_d5o&amp;ta=0&amp;o=-volume , your choice to use it or not. Lots of traders would say ""ew those stocks suck"", i get the ones with the best setup to short. 

When you start out, do not go in and immediatly trade. Paper trade first and record your trades, (don't lie about ur trades either, record the truth). Obvious learn all you can by reading books. Once you feel like you have a good understanding of daytrading (shorting) then go ahead and try it with real money. Each trade you should get in with an idea where to cut losses and collect gains

Try to avoid doing the following:
-

You have no trading plan

**You are blindly following others because they are experts** 

No clue how to set a proper r/r

""Hope"" is part of your ""strategy""

You average down on losers 

You jump from one hot trading method to another hoping for ""the answer""

Ask for stock picks

15-03-25,Discussion on NPS Pharmaceuticals - Speculative and peaking? Or room for Growth,"Tl;DR:  In my opinion, NPS is speculative. With Shire announcing the purchase and acquisition back in January, Shire now risks suffering from the problems that NPS had.  However, what else do you guys think? 

According to their website, through a combination of the values of integrity, respect, excellence, personal ownership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, and fun,  NPS seeks to create “innovative therapies that transform the lives of patients with rare diseases worldwide .” 

Politically, the development of drug treatments would benefit the United States.  By being the nation that supplied the cures for rare diseases, the United States would be considered a shining beacon of healthcare.  A similar proposition has been historically seen in the 1950’s, when, in the aftermath of Jonas Salk discovering the cure for Polio, the United States had been praised for their advancements in the healthcare field.  Economically, the potential for treatments created by the company is trickled down to the Government in the form of taxes. Not only that, but through healthcare suppliers supplying the product, the healthcare industry in the United States will economically grow.  

NPS entered the investment market in 1994, with the stock primarily increasing-or-decreasing on the basis of speculation.  In fact, the entire company is speculation.  Because NPS lives-and-dies by unproven drugs that could potentially help save lives, the survival of the company and its’ finances oftentimes is the result of the company being able to successfully apply their drug treatments to the FDA.  If the drug is passed, the resulting expected revenue for the company will lead to the growth of the company. 

The speculation of NPS Pharmaceuticals during 2014 revolved around the experimental drug, Natpara. The purpose of Natpara is to treat hyperparathyroidism, a disease that causes decreased functions in the parathyroid gland, thereby causing low calcium levels in the blood.  

In fact, this probable cause has been aided by the voice of speculation, CNBC and TheStreet’s Jim Cramer. On January 7, 2013, Cramer told viewers on CNBC’s Mad Money that while the company is speculative, “given their [NPS] main drug has been approved and the stock’s barely budged , I think we could have a real opportunity here .”  Convinced that Cramer’s belief’s may have been correct, numerous speculators put their money into NPS.  By September 2013, the stock ($8.84 in January 2013 vs. $28.78 in September 2013) surged up by 325.57 percent from the previous nine-months, causing Jim Cramer to gloat on Mad Money  

From August 2013 through October 2014, the stock rapidly fluctuated as debate over the drug created uncertainty.  Investors that put their money into the security at the time did so under the belief that if the drug had been passed by the FDA, the stock of NPS Pharmaceuticals would increase, due to the potential economic windfall for the company.  Likewise, those that pulled their money out of NPS Pharmaceuticals, or those that shorted the stock, did so under the belief that the FDA would deny the drug, thereby preventing NPS from gaining tremendous profit for their investors. 

On September 12, 2014, by a vote of eight-to-five, the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee recommended the therapy solution, Natpara.  The result of the passing should have resulted in the stock increasing by a tremendous amount, based on the financial windfall expected for both NPS and their investors.  However, the short-term market is certainly a funny business for both the speculator and value investor.  After Natpara was approved by the FDA, the stock plunged by seventeen percent.  To the investor and businessman, the collapse of share price did not make sense.  The approval of a drug that treats a rare disease is one that should ordinarily increase.  However,  because the vote (eight-to-five) was not as lopsided as predicted by investors, and since the labeling requirements for the stock are stricter than average, made investors less-than-enthused on the decision.  
Eventually, the stock recovered, although as of this writing, the stock is once again involved in a rapid fluctuation cycle.  The problem with the fluctuation of the stock market involves uncertainty for the value investor. 

Over a five-year period, NPS has increased their sales/revenue ($84.15 million in 2009 vs. $155.59 million in 2013) by 184.90 percent.  Coupled with the fact that their gross revenue during that same five-year period ($83.17 million in 2009 vs. $152 million in 2013) has increased by 182.76 percent has given investors probable cause into investing in NPS.  However, over the previous five years, NPS has not gained one cent on the market, having lost $117.81 over the period. 

The only solace that investors of NPS can obtain from looking at the balance sheet involves the rising of assets corresponding with the decrease of liabilities. During the five-year period, the current assets ($145.25 million in 2009 vs. $258.75 million), and total assets ($159.59 million in 2009 vs. $292.22 million in 2013) increased by 178.14 percent and 183.31 percent, respectively. Over this same period, the long-term debt of NPS stock ($290.19 million in 2009 vs. $123.64 million in 2013), coupled with the total liabilities ($382.39 million in 2009 vs. $187.33 million in 2013), decreased by 234.71 and 204.13 percent, respectively. 

Looking at the other fundamentals of the company, however, and one can see that the stock of NPS is not advisable for today’s value investor.  Since the share price of NPS (as of December 12, 2014) stood in at $31.28 with an EPS of one cent, the P/E ratio of the company was 3,128.00, meaning that the stock was over 125 times the recommended highest P/E ratio (25) for the company.  With a book value per share of $1.23, the P/B ratio of NPS is a staggering 26.34.

I'm wondering what people's general strategies are for managing their ROTH IRA/TFSA and if it's any different from their usual investing. 

Do you act a little riskier/short term because you don't get taxed on gains? 

Do you play long term to avoid losing money (since once you've maxed your contributions for the year you can't add more to compensate) in the account? 

Or do you just play it standard and balance everything out?

Holding cash seems unproductive. I can't take out of my ISA e.g mortgage due to loss of 0% tax benefits.

15-03-25,Changing the Future of Investing,"A couple of months back, a company calledrPlan got in touch with me. I am usually very skeptical about almost most emails/inquiries that I receive through SavvyScot if I’m honest… from dodgy freelancers who want to write a post in exchange for 100 high quality link backs, to people wanting to buy the blog outright; most authors will have experienced similar requests. I decided to check it out anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The concept behind rPlan is to make investing easier – the company’s aim is to create an online environment that allows investors to make informed decisions.
First Impressions
Upon visiting their homepage, instantly one fact cried out to me:
49% of investors in the UK don’t know how their portfolios performed in the last year
WHAT?! I mean seriously… come on guys. Tracking wealth is one of the basic rules of personal finance. Over the next couple of days, this statistic got me thinking about why this could be.
Did people simply have so much money that they didn’t care?
Did people forget about their investments?
Perhaps they didn’t fully understand what the investment was?
Maybe they found it too difficult to understand how to measure performance?
In reality, I think the reason is a combinations of the second two points. Investment tracking is definitely not easy and my guess is that people would rather forget about it and hope for the best. This simply isn’t good enough!
rPlan aims to change this. rPlan aims to make investing easy and give people easy access to key information. In addition to this, there are a number of financial incentives, including a rebate in commission that they receive and capped charges.
Wow this sounds good right? Almost too good to be true! Behold, I have reviewed the product for you! Furthermore, if they deem it to be the best review out of a small series (from other PF bloggers), I could win an iPhone 5… Given that I am highly competitive individual and frequently perform User Acceptance Testing in my career, I have given this some serious research and thought. That said, this review is totally impartial and my honest opinion. To those of you who think this is a boring review and might stop reading… I urge you to continue. There are some great features that I want to discuss!
I’ll start by talking about the overall structure of the site. The site is split into four main areas: Analyze, Invest, Plan and Share.  The rPlan website and portal interface has an overall simplistic and minimalistic feel to it – definitely a good start when it comes to investing! While the site is divided into the four distinct areas, the review will focus mainly on the Analytics side – essentially the most important area for an investor.
Analyse
Overview
Being able to easily track and analyse your portfolio is key to maintaining it’s health. If you are a visual person like myself, the screenshot below gives you an overview of how the portal looks and feels. There are three main summary boxes:
 Dashboard
Cost – This figure represents the total cost that your portfolio carries (usually through Investment fund fees) annually. This is a very important figure and I would highly recommend the team include a feature that calculates the actual cost of your portfolio, instead of just the percentage. This would further simplify making investment decisions. The question marks that you can make out below (next to ‘cost’) expand to give an explanation of the term and an additional link to further explanation.
Risk – This currently represents the overall risk of your portfolio on a scale of 1 to 6. I love this feature, however think that a simple modification would make a greater impact – changing the colour of the number as the risk gets higher. For example a low risk level (1) could be Green, a medium risk yellow and a high risk dark red. This would highlight the associated risk better – which is essentially the most important factor of investment. Perhaps a scale of 1-10 would also be easier to understand.
Performance 12 Months – This statistic shows the average performance of your portfolio over the last 12 months. While I think this is a useful feature, I would prefer it to show the percentage gain/loss since initial investment. I feel that this would be a more relevant figure, given that 12 months might not mean much for new investments.
A minor detail, but I think the descriptions could be made bigger. I would also like to see a change in style of the relevant heading you are currently viewing in the text in the top right hand side of the page. For example, I am currently in ‘Analyse’ so would like to see it a different colour / bold / highlighted in some way. This will help overall navigation and understanding of the portal hierarchy / structure.
Charts &amp; Graphs
This is where rPlan get’s interesting. As I just mentioned, I am a very visual person and would much rather look at a chart / diagram / picture than read a paragraph of text. The Charts &amp; Graphs section shows 4 main charts: Past Performance, Allocation, Risk, Geography. These charts are simple, yet highly effective.
Past Performance – This shows the past success of your investment over a variable time scale. (3m, 6m, 1y, 2y, 3y, 5y) I think rPlan have done really well to keep this simple, yet give enough variety of presets for changing the time period. Some other finance analytical websites have very complicated sliders and check boxes to change the timescale (which often doesn’t work well).
Allocation – This pie chart shows assets by type and category. The labels clearly indicate which countries I have investments in and also the asset type (equity, fixed income etc.) Simple, yet effective
 
Risk – As before, this shows the calculated level of risk of the portfolio. I feel this chart could be developed further to show dimensional risk – i.e. where the different levels of risk actually come from and to show the overall combined risk.
  Geography - This is quite probably my favourite overall feature of rPlan. A simple world map shows the percentage of your portfolio that is invested in each country. By hovering over a country, the percentage is shown – as demonstrated below with Thailand. I think this feature is absolutely fantastic and a great way to track how investments fund managers change their strategies! I feel this could be further improved by using a better colour scale and to label countries with high proportions of your overall investment.
 
In summary, the analytics are fantastically simple, yet clear and detailed. The data could easily be extracted into a mobile app to enable you to check performance on the move. Great work guys!
Share
I love this section of the website. Essentially the sharing section is a forum – a platform to discuss investing options and strategies between members. Obviously as I review the product, the forum is very much in BETA testing mode so it is hard to comment on specifics. Furthermore, there is the option to create private groups and restrict access to your boards. Hopefully the team behind rplan have measures in place to monitor insider / illegal trading.
Given that you have to sign up to invest to access the forum, it should prevent trolls / spamming. I am excited to see how the various threads develop.
 Screenshot from the Forum
Any Advice… anyone???
 
Closing thoughts
Overall, I love how rPlan has made it easy to obtain a high-level overview of your portfolio – a snapshot of performance. For those of us who are a little obsessed with investments and like to track them multiple times per day (I know I’m not the only one) – this is a very nifty feature! The portal is clean and friendly. Unlike a lot of other financial tools, it is not cluttered and full of uninteresting information. The virtual portfolio provides an excellent way to ‘practice’ investing before you take the plunge. rPlan has a wealth of experience in the start-up team and I am excited to see what the future holds. Good job guys!

15-03-25,Ford Motor Company: Analysis after reading Peter Lynch book,"I bought F on March 16th at 16.48. 

My basis of purchasing this stock without having read Peter Lynch's book ""One Up on Wall Street"" was the following:

* I personally love Ford vehicles. I own a F-150 and personally wanted to have ownership in the stock.
* Ford Ranger being brought back into the international market. New re-designed F-150 with aluminum built has me excited.
* Pays dividends.

After reading PL's book I realize the following:

* Bought the shares at a decent price point. Recent news gives hope that earnings will pick back up and drive price up.
* Annual balance sheet shows long term debt is being paid down. 
* Pays dividends, but knows this stock is a stalwart / cyclical and during a down-turn will not pay dividends.

I know this analysis is weak, by professional standards, however, I'm currently learning more and more about the value of stocks. I will probably re-read the book because there are some things I missed that I still don't grasp.

What is your opinion on Ford ?

15-03-25,"Today's Top 10 Most Collectible Cars","Outrageousli loves cars. Lives for cars even: classic, stylish, fast cars. So we are keen to help out with the perennial problem: what is the best car to buy today that will become collectible in the future and thus is likely to become a valuable investment?

Well where better to start in answering that question than world famous class car valuers Hagerty, the collector car experts. Hagerty have recently released their annual list of vehicles that stand out as likely being collectible within the next 25 years.

In order to be considered for the “Hagerty Hot List,” the vehicle has to produced within the 2015 model year with an MSRP of less than $100,000. Hagerty gives special consideration to newly launched versions not appearing on previous Hot Lists.

The 2015 Hagerty Hot List (along with base price):

Alfa Romeo 4C Launch Edition ($69,685) – Alfa Romeo returns to America after a twenty year absence with a junior supercar that boasts an impressive 0-60 time of 4.1 seconds, and a carbon fiber chassis. It's the apotheosis of Italianness, in every single carbon fiber making it perhaps the hottest car on a very hot Hot List. 

BMW M4 Convertible ($73,450) – The M3 and M5 have been the go-to cars for BMW Motorsports junkies since the late 1980s. The M4 offers those fans the silky torque of a twin turbo, inline-six engine but perhaps, more importantly, it’s the only M-car, other than the pricey M6, that can be had as a convertible.

Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 ($75,000) – The ultimate road course ready Camaro. Boasting a weight loss of 300 pounds and the LS7 V8 with 505 horsepower and 481 pound feet of torque, Chevrolet let the engineers out to play and they created a monster. Anyone who isn’t aware that we’re living in a new golden age of automotive performance has been clogging up the left lane for too long.

Chevrolet Corvette Z06 ($78,995) – Bang for your buck is an understatement for the supercharged Z06, which may well be the all-time performance for the dollar champion. The Corvette has now entered supercar territory at a fraction of the price of the competition from Germany and Italy.

Dodge Challenger Hellcat ($58,295) – It feels like the 1960s again. The Cold War is back and so are the muscle car horsepower wars and Dodge just exercised the nuclear option with this beast. Limited production and 707 horsepower means that the Hellcat earns its moniker. Clearly the Challenger Hellcat is here to turn fuel into noise and rubber into dust and little else.

Ford Mustang GT Performance Package ($37,125) – Although the 50th anniversary edition will be produced in far less numbers, we at Hagerty think the GT performance package is the true driver’s car. Ford had a tough job following up the 2005-14 Mustang but they’ve done it very well (better perhaps than in 1967 when the Mustang was re-designed for the first time). Here’s to another 50 years.

Mazda MX-5 Miata 25th Anniversary Edition ($33,000) – The popularity of Japanese collector cars is on the rise and the Miata has established itself as the quintessential modern roadster. With this special edition also the last of its generation, it is already sealed as a collectible with only 100 models making the trip to North America.

MINI John Cooper Works Hardtop ($24,950) – New for 2015, the 2 door hardtop John Cooper Works MINI is the most powerful MINI ever produced. The performance specs are impressive, but what will have collectors drooling in the future is the attention paid to the MINI’s design concept.

Subaru WRX STI Launch Edition ($38,190) – With a stiffer body, advanced suspension and a turbocharged Boxer four cylinder the STI is quite literally a factory built rally car that you can drive off the showroom floor.

My question is...does everyone trade in US currencies? I mean if the stock is traded in US currency you trade it in that. But does everyone have an US income? I find it difficult to follow a lot of the penny stocks on this sub because every time I want to buy something I realized I get pretty screwed on the currency exchange. Not to mention the ECN fees on questrade on top of that..    

I have looked at Canadian ones however, perhaps it's due to the fact I don't know a community that is dedicated to talking about penny stocks on TSX, I am hesitant. If someone could give me feedback on trading US penny stocks as a Canadian, that would be very much appreciated! Thank you.

15-03-26,I got crushed by Yemen,"I don't see enough posts here of people posting up their losses, so here is my story:

I had puts for OAS which were getting close to the money, I could have sold for a nice profit but instead I held convinced that this issue in Yemen wasn't to be taken that seriously and the supply glut would cause oil to continue its fall, but the price of oil spiking up on the speculation of Yemen rebels taking the oil ports has destroyed all of my gains and now I'm in the red. 

I am debating whether to just eat the loss and move into something else like shorting a biotech etf.

Options expire on April 17. I don't think see the price of oil falling enough in the meantime and theta decay will just eat me... This has turned into a speculation disaster, and I'm at a loss both literally and figuratively. 

I have my order set to sell tomorrow, hoping to see it filled because at this point things are only going to get worse for people shorting oil before they get any better in the short term. 

What do you guys think? Is this issue overblown or is there a real chance that the chokepoint in Yemen leading to the SUMED pipeline could actually fall to the rebels? I didn't think so but the president fucking ditched his country so I take that as pretty fucking serious. 

I'm not too upset because I made the gamble knowing I could lose everything, but I did not anticipate it would be due to crazy Yemen rebels....",8

15-03-25,How to properly account for geopolitical risks.,"My question is how do you factor in geopolitical risk to a stocks' value when making an investment?

For example:
You determine that the oil market is oversupplied by 1-1.5 million barrels of oil per day.
You see the potential for oil supply disruptions in countries like: Nigeria, Venezuela, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Saudi Arabia, etc., but you have difficulty determining the likelihood of those events.

Is it better to assume all else is equal and ignore the unknown factors? 

Provide an expected value based on the perceived likelihood that certain events do occur and the resulting impacts of those events?

Avoid the industry entirely?

If you do invest do you try to create an investment strategy that allows for multiple eventualities. For example: X profit if oil trades between $45-55$ and X profit if oil trades above $70 but loss if otherwise?

How do you factor in secondary factors like a collapse in Venezuela leading to higher emerging market debt and subsequently slower global growth?

Interested in hearing other peoples thoughts on calculating geopolitical/catalyst events.",1

I understand that you declare losses or gains for capital gains at the end of the tax year by January the following year, you pay tax for gains and bank the losses to be used in future.

However what happens if you remain invested? E.g. neutral. As I understand I can remove the amount invested at a later point and not pay any tax for the amount I put in due to it already being taxed when I Earned it. Do I need to declare this as it's invested in this tax year and will be withdrawn in another, or do I just submit receipts showing the investment on the capital gains form in the year I withdraw..

I hope this makes sense...

15-03-25,Choosing a Benchmark: ACWI vs. VT,"As the title suggests I'm looking to choose a benchmark for my portfolio. I have already determined that I want to track a world index, thus my two listed choices.

I'm having some trouble distinguishing between the two. The holdings are very similar, and since I will not be directly investing in these, I'm paying no attention to their expense ratios.

Essentially, what I am asking is for a discussion of how to go about choosing between the two without throwing darts at a board (choosing randomly). I'm looking for some logical decision making.

Thoughts?

**EDIT:**/u/cn1ght raised a significant point. You all have no idea of the required criteria or why I chose these benchmarks, let alone anything about my situation.

I am a 22 year old recent college grad who is currently paying down student debt. While paying this debt down, I am socking away cash into an investment portfolio which right now, is in the four digit area. 

I chose these benchmarks because over the next 10-20 years I anticipate both emerging and developed markets will continue growing (barring any temporary bear markets or pullbacks). Because of this anticipation, I want my portfolio to consist of both domestic and international stocks. I currently have no desire to overweight/underweight any particular sector. After I choose my benchmark I will conduct a top-down analysis where I will choose sector/region allocation. Right now, I just want to choose my benchmark in a way that makes sense.

My portfolio will be all stocks with some cash left to take advantage of market opportunity, and I am seeking to construct a portfolio of mostly mid/large cap assets with small cap blended in advantageous sectors such as retail.

If there are any other questions regarding my position/thinking please do not hesitate to ask. 

Much appreciated. This sub always brings some interesting points to light.

Thanks,",4

Yahoo Finance has an open API that is JSON based. You can query an asset in this format:

https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20yahoo.finance.quotes%20where%20symbol%20in%20(""*ticker*"")&amp;format=json&amp;diagnostics=true&amp;env=store%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltableswithkeys&amp;callback=

This may look like gibberish but it is NOT. It's organized chaos called JSON, and you can reference any part of it by appending each object key.

For instance, I reference the ask price by typing in:

`data.query.results.quote.Ask`

It isolates the ask price (as specified in their object). So now that you have the current ask price, you can send it off to a database to store it. 

Using an AJAX call and setInterval, we can ping the server once every x seconds for a new price, grab the price, send it to a PHP, and input it into a database. For this example I'll just use a text-file.

Here's the full code though:

#main.html
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    	&lt;html&gt;
    	&lt;head&gt;
    		&lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;
    		&lt;title&gt;title&lt;/title&gt;
    	&lt;/head&gt;
    		&lt;body&gt;
    			&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  
    			&lt;script src=""//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    		&lt;/body&gt;
    	&lt;/html&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
    counter = 0;
    setInterval(function () {
    	$.get(""https://query.yahooapis.com/v1/public/yql?q=select%20*%20from%20yahoo.finance.quotes%20where%20symbol%20in%20(%27^GSPC%27)&amp;format=json&amp;diagnostics=true&amp;env=store%3A%2F%2Fdatatables.org%2Falltableswithkeys&amp;callback="", function( data ) {
    		dataString = 'price=' + data.query.results.quote.Ask;
    			$.ajax({
    				type: ""POST"",
    				url: ""action.php"",
    				data: dataString,
    				success: function() {
    					counter++;
    					$(""span"").html(""success!"" + counter);
    				}
    			});
    	});
    }, 2000);
    &lt;/script&gt;

#action.php
    &lt;?php
    $price = $_POST['price'];
    // $price = floatval($_POST['price']; /* if you want to get the decimal form of the string */
    
    $contents = json_decode(file_get_contents('database.txt'));
    array_push($contents, $price);
    
    $handle = fopen('database.txt', 'w');
    fwrite($handle, json_encode($contents));
    
    ?&gt;

#database.txt

    []

So put all files in the same server (won't work straight on your laptop/PC if you don't have PHP installed), and open up the HTML. You should get a very basic screen that just says ""success"" and then a number. That's the number of trials. If you want to make it fancy, it's yours to do so with.

To access all the data, go to the database.txt file and you will find something that looks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/0jQ7cWK.png). 

You can do this with as many different attributes as you want (eg. volume, etc.), and with lots of tickers too. You just have the format the dataString in HTML format. If anyone has any questions on how to do that, I'll answer below!

----

A few notes about my setup:

1. I'm using a text-file because it is way simpler than explaining SQL to non-programmers. Don't use one if security is an issue or if other users have access to the HTML. Otherwise, secure that shit using htmlspecialchars, intval, etc.

2. 100% of the code is above. If anyone wants it in a little package, comment below.

3. Not sure with all browsers if you need the window to be constantly open. You will need the window with this setup to be open, but you can likely still use other tabs (definitely can with Chrome).

7:30 am ET March 26, 2015 (Globe Newswire) Print


BG Medicine, Inc. (Nasdaq:BGMD) announced today the publication of a landmark study, in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, reporting clinical outcome results of the BioImage Study.[1] The BioImage Study, sponsored by BG Medicine in collaboration with pharmaceutical and healthcare companies Abbott, AbbVie, AstraZeneca, Merck, Philips, and Takeda, is a large, prospective study of cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic men and women in the United States. The BioImage Study recruited 7,687 men and women above the age of 55 and monitored them for approximately 3 years for the occurrence of major cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, and death due to cardiovascular causes. 

The recent publication appeared in the March 24, 2015 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, the flagship journal of the American College of Cardiology. The lead authors, from the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, reported the occurrence of 216 first major adverse cardiovascular events in BioImage Study participants during the follow-up period. Of these, the authors found that 184 events, or over 85% of all events, occurred in individuals who were believed at the outset of the study to be at low or intermediate cardiovascular risk, as determined by conventional, office-based Framingham Heart Study risk assessment. 

The authors report that a significant proportion of men and women, nearly 60%, showed evidence of accumulated plaque in the major arteries that supply blood to the heart and to the brain, indicating potential undetected vascular disease. Participants in the BioImage Study underwent extensive medical imaging to detect such plaques, including experimental ultrasound measurement of the arteries in the neck, and advanced X-ray-based computed tomography scans of the heart. 

""We welcome this landmark publication on the BioImage Study cohort,"" said Paul R. Sohmer, M.D., President and CEO of BG Medicine, Inc. ""We are proud to have served as the sponsor of this major study, and we extend our sincere appreciation to the thousands of men and women across the United States who participated in this important study. Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, and we in the community of clinical science continue to strive to improve the accuracy with which we can identify individuals at truly high risk. We look forward to further exploring the extensive data collected through the BioImage Study to those ends,"" stated Dr. Sohmer.

15-03-26,What Fundamentals Affect Commodity Prices,"Good morning! Today Troy continues with the investing for beginners series. You can check the previous posts about What are stocks and how to value them, How does Currency Trading Work, How are Currencies Traded, Investing in Commodities

In the previous post I explained the basics of commodity investing. In this post, I’m going to explain exactly what fundamental factors affect commodity prices.

A Precursor
Commodity prices tend to rise and fall together, much like how stock prices rise and fall together. As the saying goes, “a rising tide lifts all boats”. If the entire U.S. economy is doing well, generally all stocks will go up. The fundamentals below impact all commodity prices.

Inflation
Inflation is a huge factor that can impact commodity prices. Thanks to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, all commodities are officially listed in U.S. dollars. Here are two important terms that you need to know

Nominal value
Real value
The nominal value of a commodity is the “official price”. If gold per ounce is at $1300 right now, then the nominal value is $1300. If inflation is 100% (a hypothetical scenario), then the nominal value of gold will also increase by 100%, doubling to $2600 per ounce.

The real value of a commodity takes into account for inflation. Let’s assume that gold is at $1300 an ounce. If inflation increases by 100%, the nominal value will increase, but the real value is exactly the same. There’s just more U.S. dollars chasing after the same amount of gold in this world!

As investors, we only care about the nominal value. Thus, when inflation picks up, commodity prices soar across the board! This is what happened in Germany with hyperinflation in the 1930’s – a loaf of bread cost a bajillion Marks (Germany’s currency at the time) to buy. The real value didn’t change (a loaf of bread is still a loaf of bread), but the nominal value exploded.

This is what happened in the U.S. during the 1970s (although it wasn’t as severe as it was in Germany). U.S. inflation skyrocked (14% per year), and commodity price spiked in the 1970s. Gold went from $30 an ounce to $600 an ounce.

Right now, we are seeing the early phases of inflation where inflation will pick up but has not started yet. Ben Bernake (Chairman of the Federal Reserve) has a genius solution to America’s economic woes – print money! That’s essentially the name of the game for his consecutive rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE). Sooner or later, this money printing is going to catch up to him (or us American taxpayers, actually) with huge inflation. And what happens when inflation hits? Commodity prices skyrocket.

Increased Demand, Decreased Supply
There is a fixed amount of supply in this world – it’s not like we can manufacture gold (alchemy!) or copper. On the other hand, demand is increasing exponentially. Can you imagine if every person in the world lived the way us Americans did! Considering the amount of stuff we waste each year (that’s how my relatives from Europe put it), the world’s resources would be depleted in a heart beat.

With developing nations increasing their standards of living, the world’s demand for raw materials such as oil and copper is outstripping supply. The Chinese are a huge buying force in the world – they are rebuilding their country after:

1800s: Britain literally robs China of all its gold and silver by drugging the entire nation with Opium (prior to the 1800s, drugs didn’t exist in China). It’s called The Century of Humiliation. China went from #1 in the world (literally, the “Middle Kingdom”) to dead last.
Early 1900s: Chinese Civil War
1950 – 1978: the Communist fiasco (Chairman Mao ruined China).
So really, China’s literally been rebuilding its entire country over the past 30 years. And because China is so big (both geographically and population wise), China consumes a ton of resources.

This trend in increasing demand and shrinking supply is only going to continue, thereby pushing up commodity prices. Factor in some more inflation thanks to King Bernake from the Federal Reserve, and you have the perfect set up for a long term bull market in commodities.

Thanks for reading! As I side note, I have something for y’all bloggers out there (and no, this is not an ad or a promotional gimmick). I’m trying out a new blogging software called Ghost for my site TradingSlugger.com. I like Ghost so much that I built a blog all about Ghost for beginners.

15-03-27,TIL Half Of The People That Sent Me Stock Questions Via PM Were Bots From 1 User,"-
It was such a strange thing to see a email back from reddit saying my account was targeted by bots. 

**Just a quick background on what happened a while back:** I complained that I was consistently being targeted by a bot and no matter what was posted was downvoted. I always got the response ""no actually you are stupid no one is targeting you"". I assumed they were correct. I thought: ""It is strange how the downvote spam stopped a few days after I sent the email.""

I sent reddit an email a few weeks ago, and shockingly I got one back finally today saying that my account was infact targeted by bots. They also said the person controlling the bots was only one person. And then they proceeded to say that the bots were taken care of. I went through my message history to see what the bots were, surely enough half of the messages were from ""banned/deleted users"". I just think it is funny how the person with all the fake accounts asked a lot of questions, then proceeded to downvote all my posts.

All of the accounts were deleted/banned for vote manipulation (said in the email), I guess I was onto something a few weeks back afterall.

Anyway since this is a post/thread, what do you guys think of get rich quick schemes, specifically ones involving the stock market? This is originally what I think pissed off the botter when I said:

15-03-27,How to Identify the Short Term Market Peak,"For short term investors and traders, it’s crucial to recognize the short term market peak when it happens.  I’ve already discussed the characteristics of long term, multi-year bull market peaks. This time we’re looking at short term peaks (that are not new all time highs) and their characteristics to help you maximize returns on your private investments.

 

Define a Short Term Market Peak

Before we identify the common characteristics of a short term market peak, we must first define this term. Here’s an example – GDX, the gold miner’s ETF:

 Multiple Resistance
Multiple Resistance
No New All Time High

As you can see from the chart above, this type of short term market peak is not near an all-time high. Rather, the market has fallen for a while, and this is the short term market peak during one of the waves in a subsequent uptrend.

Time Frame

The “wave” lasts just a few months – anything longer than 4 months, and this is not considered to be a “short term” market peak.

The Above Example

As you can see the chart for GDX (gold miners ETF) above, GDX has fallen for almost a year now (which coincides with the decline in gold and silver). Only recently has GDX moved off of its lows. This fits in perfectly with the “short term” market peak concept. GDX is nowhere near an all time high (in fact, it GDX just hit bottom), and this recent wave has only lasted over a month.

Identify the Peak

When you make short term investment decisions, you absolutely have to use technical analysis. However, the problem is that there are many technical indicators. In the event that these indicators are sending mixed signals, which one should you use? Which one is more important and can override the others? I honestly don’t know.

HOWEVER, I do know that when all the technical indicators align and point towards one direction, the probably of that happening greatly increases. If all my technical indicators send out a clear SELL signal, then the odds of the market falling is very likely.

Regarding short term market peaks, 4 things will send a clear SELL signal when they all happen at the same time:

Major resistance.
Heavy volume.
Intraday bloodbath.
Connections between markets.
Major Resistance

Markets will often peak at a price that was a massive historical resistance point. If you look at the GDX chart below, you’d notice that GDX failed to break through this resistance barrier multiple times in the past 6 months. Thus, the fact that GDX is right below this resistance level today means that it will likely fail to break this resistance (again). This sends a major warning sign that the short term peak is in.

 Multiple resistances, + the recent massive red bar
Multiple resistances, + the recent massive red bar
Heavy Volume

A lot of traders like to look at volume – I don’t really know why. They believe that volume sends a lot of clear signs – personally, I can’t seem to make volume work to my advantage.

However, volume is really useful when the market faces a major resistance and promptly falls. Such a decline in market price combined with heavy selling means that the market is very weak. Thus, a clear warning sign that the market might peak is sent.

Massive Red Intraday Bar

If the market falls really hard one day without any meaningful support, it will create a massive red intraday bar. This means that the market is really, really weak because there is virtually no support. Coupled with heavy volume, this sends a clear sign that the bears vastly overpower the bulls.

Connections Between Markets

I don’t just look at one market – I look at 8 markets. I look at multiple U.S. stock indexes (Russell, S&amp;P500, NASDAQ), multiple commodity markets (gold, silver, copper, oil), and currencies (primarily the EURO/USD pair). Why?

Because markets are highly correlated nowadays, what happens in one market will affect other markets. For example, I recently believe that the short term peak for stocks is in. Thus, stock prices will fall. When stock prices will fall, it will likely drag down gold and GDX (gold miners) prices with them.

Summary

When the following three things happen at the same time, it is very, very likely that the short term market peak is in:

A massive red intraday bar.
Heavy volume – this is the only time when volume is useful.
A massive resistance line that has stopped the market on multiple occasions.
Other markets are falling, dragging down this market with it.",1

15-03-27,How do I proceed with investing my HSA? Please look at my scenario.,"I have had an HSA account for 3 years now.  I received a call from my HSA bank asking me to put my HSA funds into their 3 month or 21 month CDs with yields between 0.75% - 1.25%.  I said no... asked if they had other investment opportunities with the HSA money, they said no.  Asked if that will change in the future and they said no plans at the moment to change.

I looked at my account and my balance is at a safe/adequate amount that I feel I should be investing it in stocks or bonds, etc...  I have a situation that complicates things a bit. The institution I work for will only direct deposit to this one bank. My company will give me $2500/year, direct deposited to this bank. I also allow them to take $1500/year out of my check and put it into the same account.  If I want to put my $1500 elsewhere, they will cut me a check each pay-period so that I can deposit it elsewhere. They will not cut me a check for the $2500/year, it has to be direct deposited into the bank they work with.

I tracked down some answers as to how I should proceed and it seems that I need to create a Wells Fargo Brokerage HSA account.  The next part is where i'm confused/not sure about. Let me know if this scenario works:

1. My company will continue to direct deposit $4000/year (2500-given, 1500-my contribution) into HSA account at the bank they work with
2. Create a brokerage hsa account at Wells Fargo
3. Direct transfer, if the current hsa bank allows me to, and if not, manually withdraw money from the bank and deposit the funds to Wells Fargo brokerage hsa account every 6 months.
4. Keep enough for out of pocket expenses at my company's bank to use for medical/dental/vision purposes.
5. Grow tax-free money with Wells Fargo HSA brokerage account.

I think doing this will not have any impact with taxes unless I do not deposit it into Wells Fargo Brokerage account within 60 days after withdrawing money from my hsa account.

Could someone shed some light as to if this will work and are there any other tax-liabilities or unforeseen problems I may run into?

15-03-27,Next few steps?,"I've done a little research on my own, but it seems like everyone's situations are so different that it's better to just ask you all myself.

I'm a 28 year old male living south of Boston. No wife, no girlfriend, no kids. I have no debt, 33k between a checking and savings account, and 8k in cash. I make around 65-70k a year as a truck driver, and maybe a little side income playing poker. I've saved everything that I have now over the last 2 years. I feel incredibly accomplished being able to save a little over 20k a year for the past 2 years, but I've recently got confused on where to go next. My original plan was to keep saving for another couple years, and eventually put a nice down payment on a multi-family home. The plan would be to live there, and also rent out as much of the property as possible. Pound the mortgage, and try to have it paid off in 10 yrs or so. I recently opened a ROTH IRA with Scottrade last week, but am yet to fund it.

My problem stems from my recent research. I've found that, nobody really gets wealthy off of long-term investments and general saving. It seems to result from owning/operating/investing in businesses. But first, don't you need to have some great business idea? I feel like that only happens to witty and lucky people. I have drive, but let's be honest....I'm only a truck driver lol my question to all of you is - should I follow through with my original plan of putting down almost everything I've saved on a house? Or am I better off saving my capital for some type of risky business venture in the future? I'm young and single, so I guess I  can afford to be risky and afford to ""fail"" once or twice, but I'd really like not to lol

2) does anyone have list of great brokers they use that are cheap (low $ per trade) and that have decent stop loss order placement? i was able to find this (http://finviz.com/store/how-to-choose-a-broker.ashx), but wondering if anyone can vouch or offer alternatives.

15-03-26,Patient Capital Outperformance: The Investment Skill of High Active Share Managers Who Trade Infrequently,"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2498743


September 19, 2014

Abstract:      
This paper documents that among high Active Share portfolios – whose holdings differ substantially from the holdings of their benchmark – only those with patient investment strategies (i.e., with long stock holding durations of at least 2 years) outperform their benchmarks on average. Funds trading frequently generally underperform, regardless of Active Share. Among funds that infrequently trade, it is crucial to separate closet index funds – whose holdings largely overlap with the benchmark – from truly active funds. The average outperformance of the most patient and distinct portfolios equals 2.30% per year – net of costs – for retail mutual funds. Stocks held by patient and active institutions in general outperform by 2.22% per year and by hedge funds in particular by 3.64% per year, both gross of costs.",8

15-03-26,"I think that ARLP is one of the most attractive investments in the market right now. Here's my reasoning (OC research):","**Background:**

Alliance Natural Resource Partners (ARLP, currently trading at around $33 a share) is a U.S. based thermal coal (the kind used for electricity, as opposed to mettalurgic coal which is used for steel). It is the 8th largest producer of coal in the country, and has consistently grown capacity by double digits per year for more than a decade.

ARLP produces only thermal coal, and does not export. It is therefore not directly affected by either international coal demand or by steel demand.

**Answer to immediate objections:**

1: ""Coal is a dying fuel, we won't be using it at all in the near future!""

* Actually every single major energy organization expects coal to generate a significant amount of our power all the way through 2040. Even the EPA, who hate coal and would love to see it gotten rid of, model coal to maintain a stable share of the power generation market (25-30% of total power) through 2040.

2: ""Solar/Nuclear/Wind/Fusion are going to take all the share and coal will stop being used!""

* No, see above. No one in the energy industry actually thinks this.

3: ""China is so polluted, they're not going to use anymore coal, that's the death knell for the industry!""

* Emerging markets matter a lot to some of the biggest players, but ARLP does not export coal. They sell exclusively into the U.S.

**Basic valuation**

ARLP is currently trading at 7.0x TTM P/E, and 8.0x forward. Even if there is no growth at all in earnings, the stock is still attractive at less than half the average multiple of the S&amp;P. 

To put some numbers on it, a basic DCF shows the following (growth expressed as 5 years annualized, 12% discount rate, 12x exit multiple):

* Value assuming no growth: ~$60, almost 100% upside
* Value assuming 10% unit growth: ~$100, 3x upside
* Value assuming -10% units &amp;-15% pricing: ~$32, no change

**Thesis**

The company is a good trade even without unit growth or improved coal pricing, but there are two factors that make me believe we'll see both:

1: The competition is in the shitter right now.

* 4 of the top 5 U.S. coal producers are losing (a lot) of money every quarter, and none of them are expected to turn a profit next year. They are highly levered, and some are getting dangerously close to tripping the covenants on their debt.

* Newly passed regulations favor the type of coal that ARLP produces (due to its position in the Illinois Basin) at the direct expense of the certain competitors. In fact, I've been told that as many as 50% of the mines in certain regions of Appalachia are currently not profitable, and are only continuing to be operated because it would cost more to shut them down that to keep them running. This is unsustainable, and ARLP is well poised to pick up the slack, having just purchased a large new swath of reserves contiguous to their current operations. 

2: Coals most serious competition is natural gas, but rig counts are falling and there's a good chance that a lot of supply will be coming offline as quickly depleting shale wells aren't renewed given current abysmal O&amp;G pricing.

**Evidence and additional assurances**

With that highly condensed version of the thesis, let's move on to a bit of evidence, and some other key bits of information that provide some comfort:

Exhibit 1: ARLP has already made an agreement to acquire equipment and potentially contracts from Patriot Coal, who is drastically curtailing operations to try and stave off bankruptcy. Patriot is a spinoff of the largest U.S. coal producer, Peabody, that contains their unionized mines and the pension liabilities that go with them (which is currently the subject of a lawsuit). This shows that the beginnings of failure are already happening.

Exhibit 2: There have been a number of announcements related to supply cuts by major producers, and ARLP as taken market share. 

Exhibit 3: According to EIA data, ARLP has a far better contracting position, with a majority of their supply being contracted for between 1 and 3 years out. Their main competitors are heavily weighted towards contracts that expire much sooner. 

Comfort 1: ARLP has a stellar long term track record (especially compared to other coal companies), and a widely lauded management team that's been in place for decades. 

Comfort 2: As stated, the majority of ARLP's supply is already under mid to long term contracts.

Comfort 3: ARLP has far less debt than the competition, and has room to add more if needed.

Comfort 4: Due to its location, ARLP has great access to all three major types of transportation: rail, barge, and truck. Others do not share their level of access and flexibility on transportation.

***

I would encourage anyone that's interested to dig into the EIA data. There's so much there that you can work with to prove out the points I've laid out above. I've done a lot of work with it, as well as EPA forecasts, transportation costs, mine and plant level models, and talking to management, that's all lead to my conviction on the investment. I hope this encourages a few of you guys to take a look beyond the headlines, or at least that it was an interesting read.

15-03-27,Sanity check: about to invest 10% of my net worth in an early stage startup,"An assumption I'd like you to make is that this is a very promising startup, one very smart VC's and angels would invest in (many are). I know you don't know that and many people will naturally be skeptical of my methods in determining that -- I would do the same. But for the purposes of answering my question, please try hard to assume I'm right.

It's a very early stage startup. They have revenue, growth, a great team, a great product, an amazing market, other strong positive signals and they could become a multi-billion dollar company. But it's very early stage. So the most likely outcome of course is that they will fail and I won't see a dime. 

If I had the funds to make equivalent bets 10,000 separate times, I'm certain I would crush the S&amp;P500 over the long run.

15-03-28,Dividend capture using protective puts offset by calls.,"I am considering a dividend capture strategy by buying an ITM front month put, and offsetting the cost of the puts by selling deep OTM naked calls in the intervening months, as well as front month in combination with portfolio. Super juicing this by using portfolio margin.

1. The Put give downside protection, and to help cover the ex-dividend drop. 
2. The calls helps to defray the cost of the puts, but obviously have to be managed so they aren't in danger of a. being called for someone else to capture the dividend, and b. that they don't drift into being ITM.
3. Portfolio margin leverages the dividends. 

What do folks think - what dangers lurking I am not thinking of???

15-03-28,Employee Shareholder Proposal - Is this a good deal?,"I have just been offered an Employee Shareholder Proposal. I have no experience with any of this. I will most likely seek third party advice.

The small corp I work for has 2800 shares. They are offering me non realized shares. Shares are currently valued at about $3,000. 

The proposal:

Employee Share Accumulation is for 7 years x 7 shares per year for a total of 49.

Vesting:
2015: 0 (if contract executed will backdate to Jan 1st)
2016: 0
2017: 0
2018: 0
2019: 21
2020: 28
2021: 35
2022: 42
2023: 49

All shares must be held for minimum of 3 years to be vested.

As is apparent by the structure the goal is long term retention.

Projections of share value in 2023 show a value of $5,000. Looking at the numbers I would say this is easily attainable.

Looking at the projected value balance for 2021 ($245,000) I would say that this would be equivalent to my complete reimbursement package for that year (Side not - in the terms of the contract there is a one year no compete clause in my home state, so in theory if I left &amp; I didn't want to move I couldn't work for a year). I have yet to look at inflation and the time value money.

I am 32 years old. I have other options such as working elsewhere or starting my own company. I also see huge potential in my current company with massive growth opportunities. My current company is a small construction company with gross reciepts of $33mil last year. There will be 5 other shareholders along with the original owners who will always be maintaining a 51% share.

Any input or guidance would be great. The only condition they said was non neg was the 4 years 0 vesting.

15-03-28,Intel in talks to buy Altera. Good time to buy INTC?,"By Dana Mattioli and Dana Cimilluca in New York and Don Clark in San Francisco

Intel Corp. is in advanced talks to buy chip partner Altera Corp., according to people familiar with the matter, a move that would represent the semiconductor giant's biggest-ever acquisition.

It wasn't immediately clear how much Intel would pay for a deal. Altera had a market capitalization of about $10.4 billion before The Wall Street Journal first reported on the talks and ended Friday valued at $13.4 billion. It would be a big bite for Intel, which has historically stuck to smaller-size acquisitions.

The Santa Clara, Calif., company is a giant in the semiconductor business and had a market value of $151.6 billion. It is the largest maker by far of chips that supply calculating engines in PCs and server systems.

Altera, based in San Jose, Calif., is one of the two largest makers of field-programmable gate arrays, or FPGAs, which can be configured by customers for various tasks after they are manufactured. FPGAs are widely used in phone networks, computer-networking equipment, cars and other products.

Altera and longtime rival Xilinx Inc. have pushed FPGAs into new areas where customers once designed chips from scratch. These chips can be programmed to carry out specialized tasks like data encryption and work much faster than standard microprocessors like Intel's Xeon.

Intel and Altera have worked together in the past. Intel, which has tried to build a new business out of manufacturing chips for other companies, in 2013 reached an agreement to offer its most advanced production process to Altera.

Buying Altera would further solidify their manufacturing partnership, and help Intel keep its factories full. Still, a tie-up with Altera may not help Intel place more of its chips in smartphones, now a major gap in its portfolio as more computing activities take place in pocket-size products. A deal indirectly could help Intel in the mobile market; Altera chips are widely used in the wireless base stations that connect cellphone users.

A combination would add a fast-growing business to Intel; Altera's revenue is climbing faster than Intel's--up 12% to $1.93 billion last year while Intel's rose 6.1% to $55.9 billion.

""I think FPGAs are hot and having [Altera] in-house is a big win for Intel,"" said Roger Kay, an analyst at researcher Endpoint Technologies Associates.

Intel investors cheered the possible deal. The company's shares, which had risen 18% in the past year, shot up 6.4% to $32 after the Journal reported talks were under way. Altera stock, which had been down 2.5% in the past 12 months, jumped 28% to $44.39.

Altera, a so-called fabless chip designer that owns no factories of its own, mainly has relied on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to build its earlier generations of products. Past industry mergers suggest Altera would continue to use TSMC to make those chips, even if it becomes part of Intel, because of the difficulties of moving production.

Intel, which built a huge franchise in the PC market in the 1990s, began suffering several years ago as consumer spending shifted from laptop computers to tablets and smartphones. Despite efforts to crack the smartphone market, the semiconductor pioneer largely has failed to match the success of rivals like Qualcomm Inc.

Though the PC business has rebounded somewhat, Intel's results have remained under pressure. The company this month cut its revenue outlook for the first quarter by nearly $1 billion to roughly $12.8 billion.

Under Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, who took over in 2013, Intel has continued trying to break into mobile devices and focused on newer opportunities such as wearable computing devices. Those efforts have so far failed to boost Intel's revenues by much, however.

The semiconductor industry, meanwhile, is facing a consolidation wave as mature companies like Intel find it harder to expand their existing businesses on their own. Another factor is the increase in costs to design new chips that pack more features on each square of silicon, which is driving some smaller players into the arms of larger rivals.

Just this month, NXP Semiconductors NV agreed to buy Freescale Semiconductor Ltd. for $11.8 billion.

""About six months ago I said in five-to-10 years, half of the companies we know today won't exist anymore,"" Scott McGregor, CEO of chip maker Broadcom Corp., said in an interview soon after that deal was disclosed. ""And it's pretty solid on that track.""

So far this year, there have been more than $21 billion in announced semiconductor deals globally, not including any Intel and Altera tie-up, according to Dealogic. That is a 122% increase over the same period last year, and the largest year-to-date total since the data provider started keeping records in 1995. In all of 2014, there were only $ 39.1 billion of chip deals announced, according to Dealogic.

Intel's last significant acquisition was its $7.7 billion deal to buy security-software company McAfee Inc. in 2011. Around the same time, Intel purchased Infineon Technologies AG's wireless-chip business for $1.4 billion.",1

I am thinking about putting 20% down - 30K and taking a loan for 120K. With a 3.2% interest rate at 10 years I am looking at $1,210 per month in mortgage payments.  

1600x11-1210x12 = $3080 in income per year. 
3080 - property-tax = 1080 per year. 

I feel like this is a great way to make passive income. And the numbers don't lie. But what is the catch ? What am I missing ? What else do I have to consider? Please educate this child. 

Thanks r/investing.

15-03-27,State of Moderation in r/WSB,"Hello WSBers, it's been a while since I've made my last post here and for that I apologize.  Over the past eight months or so I have made some large life changes, including career and the country of residence.  I want you all to know that I have not abandoned the sub and do not  plan to anytime soon.

Since my absence about 8 months ago, many things have been brought to my attention regarding the leadership of this sub.  I hope to have an open and frank conversation regarding this in efforts to continue nurturing it and harnessing the great power that this community has and brings to the table.

1. First, I'll point out that there has been some growth in subscribers and views.  This graph will show you the uptick of about double the traffic in the past few months http://i.imgur.com/z7kgVAZ.png .  With this growth, comes inevitable change in dynamics to the participants.  More trolls, nonsense, jokers, spam etc... It is with this in mind that we should all work together to combat the [Eternal September](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) effect and maintain the quality and good spirit of the sub.

2.  Second, due to my inability to participate as actively as I once could, I anticipated the need for new mods.  I added several new mods (they have come and gone over the past few months) in hopes of finding the right fit.  And trust me, there is a lot of modding to do!  **The reddit spam filter is extremely aggressive** and can be confused for censorship.  Here is an example if things are left unmoderated **http://i.imgur.com/IiHEE9s.jpg** -- this is a list of posts that never saw the light of day.  Perfectly legitimate posts that were caught in the spam filter and should have been approved.  Sometimes the submitters message the mods and the post gets unflagged, but as you can see there is a large quantity of posts that unfortunately just disappear due to lack of proper moderation.  If you submit a post and it does not show up, please be sure to message the mods.  We will be taking actions to mitigate this issue but we need your help as well.  

3.  Fourth, Some of you have voiced concern about the new moderator's style.  With this in mind, adding even more mods will run the risk of more chaos so I am hesitant to do so at this time.  This is addressed below.

4.  Fifth,  user /u/CoolRunner has been particularly helpful with his critiques of /r/WSB moderation recently [in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2zvh17/why_the_sudden_influx_of_mods_a_month_ago_and_how/cppuoud) and we have taken it to heart.  /u/CoolRunner, I want you to know that I do appreciate your constructive criticism even if it is harsh at times.  I hope all of you can also give him thanks for his ideas.  He was given the opportunity to mod for a short period of time before he began to abuse his rights (according to another mod) and was quickly stripped of his power.  However his suggestions are very much welcomed.  In fact I welcome everyone's feedback and I guarantee that I do not take any of it personally.   Please continue to voice your opinions.

5.  Sixth, thanks to said /u/CoolRunner 's suggestion to implement an autobot moderator.  This is /u/WSB-AutoMod2012.  It is built on an open source program that can be found on github https://github.com/Deimos/AutoModerator - and has been modified to follow rediquette rules as well as WSB rules on the sidebar.  Rather than outright banning posts or people, it simply posts a warning message.  It has temporarily been stripped of additional powers while we iron out the kinks (the bot is still in Beta stage).  Anyone who wishes to contribute please message the mods or /u/CoolRunner (as I'm sure he'll pass the message along).  Please be patient while we work this out, I believe it is better than having so many posts auto-burried by reddit dragnet.

6.  Seventh and final -- /u/JPoor_The2nd.  This is going to sound like a joke but it's 100% true, so bear with me.  This mod is controversial, I know it.  He is childish and doesn't seem to realize that he can write comments without the need to distinguish them, no matter how immature they are.  Please be patient with him, or ignore him if he bothers you.  Without getting too personal, JP is a friend of a relative who asked me the massive favor to make him a mod here.  Believe it or not, JP is a full grown adult in his mid twenties.  But he suffers from certain social impairments and mental disorders that I won't discuss here.  He will remain mod with comment distinguishing abilities, albeit without any additional powers.  I ask all of you to please help him and me out and treat him with respect.  If he gets out of hand please let me know.

And with that I'd like to open up the discussion to all of you guys.  Please let me know what your thoughts are, good or bad.  I welcome suggestions and observations with no hard feelings.   If you can think of additional ways to solve these problems.  I will have some time this weekend to take it all in and hope to give this place the tune up it deserves.  ",12
15-03-28,"I cannot invest anywhere, would using Metlife be an ok option in this case?","In my country, to invest you need to haves lots of money, nothing for small amounts, they just don't accept you.

I sell stock at at $15. I incur $.50 in commission fees.

So I have some money to invest but I'm having difficulties determining how much money to put where. I am 21 years old and these are investment for long term i.e 10 years+.

30% in cash, more specifically the Santander 123 current account which would generate 2.4% return (after tax) and would also act as an emergency fund/easy access cash.

30% in equity funds, I have a few in mind at the moment.

30% in Index funds. Not sure which ones to go with, probably something that tracks the FTSE100 or the FTSE All Share.

10% remaining to play around with and invest in individual shares and riskier funds etc.

15-03-28,Vanc Pharmaceuticals,"I'm a long time lurker here at r/investing. I have had a lot of success over the last few years investing in small caps that I deemed to be undervalued or ready to fill a market need.

Lately I have been looking at Vanc Pharmaceuticals (NPH on the TSV). I found this company after reading about the Concordia Healthcare purchase of Covis Pharmaceuticals for $1.2B recently. Covis is a generic drug company, with 18 branded and generic drugs in its portfolio. 

I did some reseach on similar companies in Canada and came across NPH. The current version of the company is in its infancy, and with only a $30M market cap it is very small. However, after doing my research I believe there is a HUGE amount of potential. 

A few factors play into my view of this company:

1. NPH has a portfolio of close to 40 generic molecules, most of which have been approved by Health Canada and the BC Ministry of Health.

2. NPH has signed a LOI with multi-chain Western Canadian pharmacy.

3. NPH's current management is very strong with numerous success with other companies. Specifically, the CEO Arun Nayyar with over 30 years in the generic pharm and OTC markets.

4. NPH has hired a sales team and is expecting to start earning revenue in Q2 of this year. 

5. The generic and OTC market is growing as a number of patents for name brand drugs expire. 

This is just a quick snapshot of the company. Obviously, there are huge risks when investing in such small companies. Therefore, always do your own DD!! ",6
15-03-29,"Let's talk about BBRY.","Blackberry (BBRY) posted a surprising profit ($0.04 EPS) and larger than expected deterioration in revenues ($660mm) on Friday. Analysts expected cash burn, instead about +200mm free cash flow.

The Numbers:

- Market Cap is now ~5bn

- Cash is now 3.27bn (highest in company history) with 1.5bn in convertible debt

- Net Cash suggests core BBRY worth ~3.2bn

- Guidance for Software is 600mm through inorganic and organic growth from approx. 250mm last year

- Software revenue growth rate compared to other software companies with similar margins could value the business from $1.5-2.5bn (Conservative to Most Aggresive)

- Company will be acquisitive in software moving forward

- Company positioned well with BBM, BES12, QNX operating system and their initiatives in the IoT

- Service business continues to deteriorate, but hardware business seems promising and stabilizing

- Guidance for Hardware ASP implies increase. 90% of hardware sold was new generations. Bad inventory is gone

- AT&amp;T and Verizon stores did not contribute to full quarter of hardware sales (more like 1/3). ATM Classic sell 2 per 1 Passport

- So, market implies hardware, services, patents, and property valued ~ 0.7-1.7bn which seems very low with rising ASP and higher gross margins moving forward

- FCF guidance is positive. If company generates 500mm cash this year (conservative given past two Q), the company trades at net cash 6x forward FCF which again seems very low


Things to consider:

- Lots of cash generated this Q was through investments

- Not much details on EZ-Pass conversions to BES12. Cause for concern.

- Company may have to drop hardware business at some point and only focus on software

- Street can remain bearish, sentiment is pretty low now. Analysts argue easier to cut costs and get EPS than stabilize revenues (agreed to an extent)

tl;dr BBRY could be a great speculative buy, and it's starting to generate lots of cash with better gross margins and (hopefully) revenue stabilization and growth. Nonetheless, do your own DD.

Is it possible to be perfect in the stock market? Before you say no, let me also ask you this, can almost every game be played perfectly? It doesn't need to be a human playing, it could be a set number of super advanced algorithms to detect the perfect move everytime.

-

Think about it, is there any algorithm achievable that literally ""solves"" the stock market? I think of it like this, every game has a way of being played perfectly (chess is the best example) shouldn't it be true in the stock market? I mean, you just predict if stocks go up or down. Well there is a issue you have to think about, and it is all the factors that come into play. Example: a war breaks out, some bad news comes out, etc. Well most people would say ""yeah because of that it is impossible"". But what if a bot could see that coming, predict how the market reacts with perfect accuracy? If anything it just isn't achievable by humans.

15-03-29,"Should I average down in MSFT, and other comments about my portfolio","I am a college student beginning investor with around 10k to invest. Right now I hold 24 shares of AAPL ($2,969.09) and 35 shares of MSFT ($1,433.95), which leaves around $6k in cash (I know I am not well diversified).

I bought MSFT around 5 days ago and since then it has dropped 5%. I am thinking about buy more (maybe $500-$1000) to take advantage of what I think is a low price. If it drops further (and not as a result of poor earnings or something like that, for just no apparent reason), I'll continue to buy more. Is this a bad idea? I feel like this strategy makes me the kind of person who sticks with their losers and sells their winners.

Some of you may advice me to dump stocks and get into an index fund like VTI. The reason I don't like doing this is I like picking my own stocks, even if that means I'm at some disadvantage (its more fun!). I figure since I'm in college, the more years of experience I can get, the better off I will be. Also, VTI hold stocks that I don't like (such as GOOG, FB, T) which are trading at higher PE ratios than I'd like (but this might be a weak analysis.) 

I am also in an automatic DRIP program, so when my stocks pay dividends they are automatically reinvested.

Any advice?

15-03-29,"What are some ways I can practice ""paying myself first?""","I just graduated college this year and got a job with a decent salary/benefits. What some ways I can pay myself first? Things I am already doing: 

1) Maximizing my 401k contributions. 

2) Set up an invested HSA account through my employer.

3) Set up a Roth IRA. 

4) I've had a personal account for individual stock choices for a while now. 


Big question: How do I utilize all of these tools to pay myself first and maximize my earnings potential? Should I set up some dollar cost averaging strategies where I can put my a portion or all of my paycheck into stocks/bonds immediately after being paid? How/where would I set this up?

**GBSN** has Float: 2.16M. (NOTE: THIS STOCK IS A PUMP!: http://stockpromoters.com/View-Stock-Promotions-By-Symbol.aspx?symbol=gbsn&amp;ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolderyy%24Footer1%24Image2.x=12&amp;ctl00%24ContentPlaceHolderyy%24Footer1%24Image2.y=20)It is extremely volatile and it could really run up a lot. Ideally in the morning it parabolics to the 3 mark and begins to hold up, where I will get short risking off of 3. If the stock begins to gap up above 3, I will be expecting a parabolic to the 3.50 mark and will be going short risking off the high of the day.



**HQCL** is just running up so much lately. HOWEVER the stock is beginning to show serious weakness around the 2.15 - 2.20 mark. If the stock does not break the 2.15 - 2.20 mark right off the bat then I will go short risking off the high of the day. Ideally it just washes out and I will get in almost immediately.



**CCIH** is up on good earnings. I am expecting a parabolic to at most the 10.30 to 10.50 mark and I will get short risking off the high of the day. If the stock fails to break over 10.30 right off the bat then I will get short risking off the previous days close (10.30). A lot of people are likely to be taking profits so it wouldn't be surprising if the stock washes out below 10.




**CNIT** is a chinese company, I will be shorting this stock on its first red day (as long as it doesn't pop SSR and it has a weak close).


Idk what it is about this subreddit but there is no reason you should be buying ECIG right now. If the stock fails to break .8 it could just washout again. I think buying this stock would be extremely reckless and foolish.

15-03-28,Timing Stock Purchases (US),"Hi. I have a generic question. When ever I have say a couple of thousand dollars saved up, I look for the overall market to go down and spend that money on a stock purchase. Is this a good enough ""buy low"" principle? Also, if there are couple of stocks that have priced down when the market is down, I try to pick the stock whose price is closer to the 52 Week Low mark. Is this a good idea? Of course, I have pre-screened most of my stock picks and I have a short list of stocks that I would like to own. 

Would appreciate any changes to the above method and any other approach that you may suggest - just trying to follow the ""Buy Low Sell High"" type of thing. However, I must confess that I am not good in the Sell High part since I seem to hold on to the stocks on a long term basis. When I say Long Terms I mean something like 5 years or so. 

Thanks for your time

15-03-28,SIMPLE VS SEP IRA for my small business.,"Somehow the more I read the more confused I get about my particular situation.

I co-own a company, 50/50. We have two part time employees.

I'm ready to start throwing a good portion of my money into an IRA and would like to set it up through my business. My partner, on the other hand, doesn't want to make regular contributions like I do. Neither of our employees will likely contribute either, as they're working for fun money and make about a grand after taxes.

With a SEP-IRA, can the business contribute to employee (owner) IRAs unequally? For example, I'd like to sock away 15% of my income, but she doesn't want to contribute at all. Or am I limited to the $5500 in my individual unless she wants an employee contribution as well?

I started working in a small, local, brokerage house. We offer local products. Mostly bonds, preferred stocks, CDs, some common stocks (these are rare), and besides these, we are the only brokerage house that offers a mutual fund service in fixed income securities in the country.
We do what any other brokerage house does: advice, manage portfolios, and ""sell."" But I think we could do a whole lot more. The only problem is that I don't know what the ""whole lot more"" is.

So I told him I am most likely pursuing either Business Management or Business Administration with a minor in finance. I told him I have had a interest in the stock market and investing for almost 2 years now, and he mentions that his son has his own hedge fund. I almost choked on my food. He insisted that I go meet his son at his office to talk about the field of investing and learn more about it. I was stunned. I know a good amount about investing, Ive been trading using paper money for some time and have recently opened my own account to trade under. I know what hedge funds do, how they work, and how they make money. He said his son personally knows the CEO of Coca Cola and Mellon bank, and he responsible for the start up accelerator and providing seed funding to the university downtown. In all honesty I am gonna ask if I could be a unpaid intern at his office over the summer to immerse myself in the environment. The fact that it would be a 45 minute drive doesn't even phase me, because an opportunity like this is something I have dreamed about.

15-03-28,What are your methods of closing your trades? Winners and losers.,"So last week I made a few trades that left my account stale pretty much. I bought INTC at 30.07 and it went down into the 20's shortly after. Now it's at 32.00 and I'm up like almost 7%. I'm unsure of when to close this trade. The news of Intel acquiring altera clearly helped me reverse the losses that I would have had on this trade otherwise so it's a blessing. I feel like I should take it and focus on other stuff.

Also, a few weeks ago I bought TSLA, at $196.40. I saw it drop to $188 and rise to $203, so I held it for a bit with plans to sell for profit still but... I fucked it up and never did. So it's sitting at $185 and I'm down about the same amount as I am up in INTC. I love TSLA and believe they'll recover but I don't want to see it fall to some ridiculous level and sit there. It's a weird stock to hold, as we've seen since its been around.

So what then? Do I cut them both and be glad that my year to date return is still the same? 

I have a few methods that I go about to make these decisions but I would like to hear your guys ideas.

15-03-30,Passive Income Series – Forex Trading – A New Investment Option,"Diversify your portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. How many times have you heard these statements? While these statements can apply to more to just finances, the chances are that you understand that it is a bad idea to invest all your cash in one stock, or put all your money into the same property - but have you really thought about a long term strategy?
Current bank interest rates can only be described as shocking. I read an article at work today that discussed how an Aberdeen Assets fund manager has stated that the safest place for savers to put their money is in shares. While this might seem like an outrageous statement to most, he makes a good point; investing money in a savings account is a pretty bad idea. Given the current rates of inflation versus the interest rates… you are guaranteed to lose money.

What is Forex Trading?
Forex Trading is something we have all probably heard about at some point – perhaps through an advert in the Financial Times or a money magazine of some sort; but do you actually know what it means? Forex trading is the trading of foreign currency (hence the name foreign exchange). Essentially, you buy one currency with another – the idea being using the fluctuating currency conversion rates to your advantage.
 Screen Shot 2013-03-26 at 22.06.01
Success Story – The Accidental Pay Day
I have a great personal example of how you can make some serious money on the Forex markets. My uncle and his family live in the US after he emigrated over 20 years ago. After leaving the UK, he sold his property and left a large sum of money in a UK bank account. He owns a project management type business and a few years back had to transfer a large sum of money as collateral for an insurance bond – essentially he had to use the nest egg as a guarantee against the insurance policy for a job. He transferred the money from GBP (British Pounds Sterling) to USD (US Dollar) at a rate of approximately $2 for every £1. £80,000 of savings became equivalent to $160,000.
Now he kept this money in the bond to guarantee the insurance for about nine months and transferred the cash back to his UK account shortly after. He thought nothing of this for about a year, until he received his annual interest statement for the UK bank account. Can you imagine the shock (and delight) upon finding out that £80,000 was now over £100,000!? Now I can assure you that the bank didn’t decide to pay him 25% interest, but instead the foreign exchange markets had changed significantly: £1 to $2 had become £1 to $1.50. A case of trading the money at the right time – Had it been the other way around, he would have made a significant loss!
 
Who is Forex Trading For?
The simple answer is everyone! Anyone is able to trade in foreign exchange, but those who have interests and investments in multiple countries had a slight advantage as they can trade between bank accounts. For example, if I have investments in the US (or at least in dollars) and in the UK, I could benefit from having assets in both currencies and move funds when the markets are advantageous to your positions, but there can be significant fees associated with this technique. Others will use Forex trading platforms to convert money between different currencies with the intent purely to make money – i.e. there is no practical reason (like to invest in a property) for converting from one currency to the other.
 
Like anything else, Forex Trading has a level of risk associated with it. There are many resources online where you can learn about the principles of Forex and trading within the market. I highly recommend that you do some reading and research before jumping in – You can lose money as well as gain through trading currencies. That said, if you are totally risk adverse, maybe the low-interest savings accounts are a better option. You have to be prepared to lose some (if not all) of your investment or play. Similar to the stocks and shares, some currencies are more stable than others – politically unstable currencies are far more likely to fluctuate than the US dollar.

* Average quality assets, okayish-levels of debt

* Outstanding management team.

* HUGE recovery potential and again, the current yield is supported by earnings. Low decline assets. Not at immediate risk of bankruptcy.

I think Zargon Gas has pretty much bottom out after its long, long, LONG downfall. I think it might be worth a shot at this super low price, if only for the dividend.

Next, just bunch of stupid plays where I identified support lines for XOM and FB which didn't work out. Also BMRN, if I would've held I'd be a rich man as of last Friday.

15-03-30,Euro area is gaining momentum,"Recent euro-area data releases have consistently surprised to the upside, adding to evidence that the region's recovery is gaining momentum, according to Standard Chartered research notes.

Consumption and net exports are likely to be driving growth in Q1, when GDP growth could reach as high as 0.5% q/q, and the conditions are in place for a sustained investment improvement after a prolonged downturn. 

The euro-area PMI composite has risen to 54.1 in March, the highest since May 2011. France and Italy remain the weakest major economies, but there are bright spots in both countries, with GDP growth likely to pick up from a dismal Q4-2014 in both cases. Meanwhile, Germany is off to a strong start and is likely to pull along some of its smaller neighbours. German companies are benefitting from a more competitive euro, and across the euro area growth of new orders for goods exports has hit an eight-month high, according to Markit. 

Consumption is also strengthening. Euro-area retail sales were up 3.7% y/y in January, the strongest annual increase since 2005. Consumer confidence is at the highest level since 2007 on the back of higher real disposable incomes, due to stronger earnings growth, the lower oil price and generally low inflation. Meanwhile Germany's labour market is strong, and immigration and a higher minimum wage should boost consumer spending. Across the euro area unemployment is falling, albeit from high levels in some countries. 

Bank lending data also point to a more supportive growth environment. The downtrend of loans to non-financial corporations (adjusted for sales and securitisation) eased further, reaching -0.4% y/y in February. Standard Chartered research forecasts that ""this trend will continue and we will very soon see positive y/y growth in loans to corporations. Loans to households, which usually recover earlier than loans to corporations, were up 1% y/y in February, continuing the uptrend that begun around the middle of 2014. Moreover, the third targeted long-term refinancing operation (TLTRO) take-up was strong at EUR 97bn, a signal that banks expect demand for loans to pick up. TLTRO loans are particularly helpful for banks in the periphery."" 

Greece, which was one of the best performers in 2014, has deteriorated very fast due to political uncertainty. The key risk for the euro area's recovery remains a sentiment deterioration, either over Greece or eastern Ukraine. Ongoing reform discussions with Greece are reaching a critical stage, with Athens due to run out of money over the next month unless bailout funds are released. In Ukraine, tensions have deescalated since the truce, but the situation remains sensitive.

15-03-30,"Being a landlord, the good, the bad, the ugly","Yesterday, I received an email from my tenant, asking if she could buy a new vacuum cleaner. This is the third one that would be bought for that property, in four years. I don’t know how long your vacuums last at home, but I think my mum has had the same one for over 10 years. Sure, there are four people living in the property and any item will get heavier wear and tear than if I just rented to a single person, but replacing something when you don’t even live on the same continent is a bit of a pain. And I was informed that the bath tub had some mold, a window didn’t close properly, and a few other news a landlord always dreads to listen. So to put things into perspective, here is a list of good and not so good things about rental properties.

 

The good
 

Money!! That is why you are in in the first place, so yes, it is really nice to see the money come into your account every month. Especially if you managed to get a good rental yield, and if your tenants, like mine, pay by wire transfer, you know the money will come, and it will cover the bills and then some.

 

Almost passive investment. Owning a rental is almost a passive investment. You can make it fully passive by hiring a property manager for a small fee. Except in my town that fee was above 20%, and when you take off the taxes on top, well, that’s a lot. So far I have managed to oversee everything from abroad, mainly thanks to perfect tenants.

 

Building equity. Not only are you receiving a little bit of money every month, you are also paying off a mortgage, or more exactly, your tenants are paying for it. In 20 years, you will be the owner of a property someone else paid for. I guess even your parents didn’t give you such a nice gift.

 

 

The bad
 

Wear and tear. So far this year we have had a broken heater, a broken washing machine that was first fixed then replaced, a broken vacuum and a few minor items. Total was over $1,000, which is a good chunk of profit, although it is tax deductible. You should account for wear and tear when you crunch your numbers before buying a rental.

 

Not so passive investment. Being a landlord is mostly passive, until it is not. What I dread most are vacancies. I need to put ads online, pre-screen potential tenants, then ask the current ones to meet with them for interviews and let me know the one they liked best, as they will be roommates, I have learned from being one myself at some point that it is better to put in someone the others will get along with or you are bound for disasters. When something breaks, you have to go on site, or pay an arm and a leg for someone to do it for you (my solutions, when tenants can’t DIY), eating up your rental profits.

 

Taxes. Although you can offset part of the wear and tear, and depending on where you live, the interests of your loan from the mortgage, rental income is usually taxed pretty high. Get together with an advisor to see if it is more profitable to operate your rentals under a limited company or any other setup that will help you lower your tax burden.

 

 

The ugly
 

Catastrophes. It happened to me as a tenant, my place got flooded, the roof started leaking all over my stuff and there was so much water the neighbor below also got flooded. It was a national disaster and insurance companies were overwhelmed, so my landlord didn’t get back much, just enough to fix the roof, but was still out of pocket to replace the carpet and paint the walls. Double, triple check how well insured you are, because when something happens, it can cost you thousands.

 

Bad tenants. They are the worst part of it all. When my tenant died in Paris, he had been paying his rent on and off for 9 years, but I always had landlord insurance like CIA insurance, and they paid in his place then dealt with him to get the money. When his widow stopped paying for 18 months and her eviction took that long, they paid too. They covered a cleaning of the place and took out all the trash they had hoarded for 10+ years. But the place was still a mess, in dire need of repairs after 10 years of bad treatments. I may moan about my UK tenants being needy but at least they help me keep the place in good shape, whereas the other ones didn’t let me in or make contact for years. Bad tenants are more than people who do not pay. Imagine they set your property on fire, or break all windows just because they fancy! It will take more than their deposit to cover your losses.

15-03-31,Calls and Puts,"Hey guys, I have been trading for a while, but I have never touched Options trading.  I am not sure if it is something i should be doing, but I definitely would like to become educated in options trading.

So far, this is what I understand (these are made up numbers):

~~Say there is a stock currently trading at $100.  I think this stock will hit $110 in 7 days.  So I buy a call which means I pay a premium of say $50 with a strike price of $105 that expires in 7 days.  So if the stock hits $110 on or before the 7th day, it would be smart to exercise the option because that means I would get the 100 shares at $105 a piece right?  If this is correct, would I not lose possible profit before of the premium I paid?

If I held this option to buy the stock when the stock hits 110, would I be able to sell the option to buy the stock?  Does that even make sense?  Thanks ahead~~

EDIT:  Erm, I think I figured it out, but I still have a few questions.  

I'm going to use Apple as an example.  Say I buy 1 contract at $125.00 share price that expires on the 17th of April which costs $2.76.  That means I am going to pay $276 to reserve the right to buy this stock at a price of $125.00 anytime from now until the 17th of April.  Say April 14th this stock hits $130.00.  How do I make profit at this point?  Would I need to exercise the option to buy it and then sell everything I just bought at $130.00 to make money?  Or would I just sell the option that I acquired?",12

-
Is it possible to be perfect in the stock market? Before you say no, let me also ask you this, can every game be played perfectly? It doesn't need to be a human playing, it could be a set number of super advanced algorithms to detect the perfect move everytime.

-

Think about it, is there any algorithm achievable that literally ""solves"" the stock market? I think of it like this, every game has a way of being played perfectly (chess is the best example) shouldn't it be true in the stock market? I mean, you just predict if stocks go up or down. If anything it just isn't achievable by humans. It is only achievable by robots/extremely advanced algorithms. When do you guys think this actually happens? Where a bot is able to predict where a stock is going to move with nearly 100% accuracy.


-

My opinion: I would be very shocked if within the next 100 years we create a way to figure out where the market is absolutely going to head. The amount of factors the system would have to take literally use over 1000 terabytes of info. I think it is possible just not for a while",0
15-03-31,Views on Short Float Interest in GPRO (33.72% currently),"I was curious what everyone's views were on where GPRO stands currently with a short float interest of nearly 33.72%. Even companies such as TSLA (25.66%) and NFLX (9.03%) (both extremely volatile companies) have much lower short float interest then GPRO.

I was reading up on contrarian investing and they seem to make the case that such high short float interest means GPRO has hit a bottom. The rationale is that if everyone is selling, then the stock is already at its low and can only move up. Thus, contrarians feel that a high short float interest is bullish - because eventually there will be significant upward pressure on the stock's price as short sellers cover their short positions (i.e. buy back the stocks they borrowed to return to the lender). 


Anyways, curious to see what everyone thinks.",30

15-03-30,How to Deal With a Large Decline in Stocks,"We are now 6 years into this bull market in U.S. stocks. There have been historical bull markets that lasted even 8-10 years, but these cases are rare. In other words, the current bull market is aging, which increases the probability of a bear market. In addition, it’s been a while since the last large correction (almost 4 years), which increases the possibility of a large correction.
Although I do not think that the U.S. stock market will enter into a bear market this year, there is a big chance of a large decline. I mentioned my reasons in a post titled Why the U.S. Stock Market is Making a Big Top. The main reasons are as follows:

The U.S. stock market is failing to make decisive new all time highs and volatility in the markets is massive.
The U.S. economy is starting to contract.
Corporate earnings are negative as a whole.
So while you probably don’t want to dump all your stocks because we are still in the midst of a bull market, you probably do want to shift your exposure to protect yourself from the coming decline in equities. Here’s how you can do that.

Switch to large cap stocks that pay high dividends
Large cap stocks are stocks of the big companies like Wal-Mart, AT&amp;T, Exxon Mobil, etc. As a group, large cap stocks are less volatile than small cap stocks, which are smaller companies. For example, large cap stock prices like Walmart fluctuate less than small cap stocks like Lululemon. This makes logical sense. To better understand this idea, think of the analogy of a big ship vs a small ship. Big ships are heavy and clumsy, so they move slowly. On the other hand, small ships are light and fast, so they move quickly.

During large market declines it’s best to invest in large cap stocks whose stock prices fall less. The good news is that a lot of large cap stocks pay hefty dividends. There is a reason for this correlation: large cap stocks tend to be companies that are no longer experiencing strong growth, which means that these companies don’t need to retain most of their earnings for massive expansion. That’s why large cap companies like AT&amp;T pay out larger dividends compared to the average growth company. As long as the company continues to pay high dividends, the dividends will offset some of your capital gains losses during the market crash.

As a side note, you should beware of small cap stocks that pay high dividends. No matter how “large” these dividends are, they will not equal to 20% of the stock price. The capital gains losses will vastly exceed your dividends during a large market drawdown because small cap stock prices rise fast but also tank fast.

Shift to U.S. Dollar denominated holdings
Let’s first clear up a common misconception: gold is not a safety haven. Precious metals crashed just like every other asset during the 2008 financial crisis. The only true safety haven (market that rises in a financial crisis) is the U.S. dollar. Even though some people say that the dollar is going straight to hell because of currency depreciation, it still is relatively safer compared to other currencies like the Euro and the Yen.

A lot of investors own assets that are denominated in foreign currencies. During a big correction, the U.S. dollar soars and other currencies tank. Thus, switching to U.S. denominated holdings will protect the portion of your portfolio that was previously exposed to this foreign exchange risk.

Diversify
I’m not a big believer in diversification when the market is rallying and the going is good. Steve Jobs was a huge believer in focus: you can only achieve greatness if you focus on a few things. By concentrating his portfolio on the hottest tech stocks during the late 1990s, famed trader Dan Zanger (check out his Wikipedia page) turned $10,000 into $18 million. And no, that was not a typo.

However, there is a time for diversification, and that is when the overall market turns south. If you have all your money in 2 companies and one of them goes bankrupt, you’ve just lost a huge chunk of your portfolio. Warren Buffett said that the first rule of investing is “do not lose money” and the second rule is “follow rule #1″. It take a 100% gain to make up for a 50% loss. Focus on capital preservation during large market declines.",1

*""AOT delivers viscosity reduction by coagulating particulate matter found in crude oil into nanoscale particle clusters. By aggregating these particles their total surface area is minimized, lessening their friction drag against the rest of the bulk fluid.""* (note, this is a simplified explanation of the mechanics.)

The scientist who developed the technology has publicly said that it led to the reduction in pump power by 75% in a recent test on TransCanada's Keystone II line. If what he says is true, then in due course it is likely that it will be proven out commercially. The company that has the rights in perpetuity to commercially exploit those patents is STWA.

EXCERPT FROM REPORT

*""This past summer Tao and his colleagues also successfully tested the AOT device on a section of the Keystone pipeline near Wichita, Kansas.*

*""People were amazed at the energy savings when we first tested this device. They didn't initially understand the physics,"" said Tao. ""A second test with an independent company was arranged and found the same thing."" Tests on a section of the Keystone pipeline found that the same flow rate could be achieved with a 75 percent reduction of pump power from 2.8 megawatts to 0.7 megawatts, thanks to the AOT device. The device itself uses 720 watts.*

*Once aligned, the oil retained its low viscosity and turbulence for more than 11 hours before returning to its original viscosity. But the process is repeatable and Tao and his colleagues envision AOT stations spaced along a pipeline, significantly reducing the energy necessary to transport oil. ""*

----

TECHNICAL STUFF

For the technical aspects of how the field actually works to reduce viscosity, you should consult Tao's scientific papers. The science is settled, basically, and he gave a presentation at the recent American Physical Society conference about the experiments on Keystone and elsewhere. The details of that are here:
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150227112751.htm?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+sciencedaily%2Ftop_news+%28ScienceDaily%3A+Top+News%29
reference: R. Tao, G. Q. Gu. Suppressing turbulence and enhancing liquid suspension flow in pipelines with electrorheology. Physical Review E, 2015; 91 (1) DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.91.012304
Here is that paper: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByxwXcZlX2dXTFFJWDhabUJQNlk/view

Basically the electric field creates a polarised charge in the oil, and the molecular particles of stuff inside crude -- like paraffin, asphaltene, etc. -- instead of crashing around, clump together. Those molecules become electrically charged, and so they attract, and form the shape of prolate spheroids. They align parallel to the direction of flow. This has two consequences: it reduces the viscosity of the material traveling in the direction it is flowing, and it increases its viscosity perpendicular to the direction it is flowing. One of the big problems for transporting crude through pipes at high speeds is that the flow starts to get turbulent once it reaches certain velocities. Turbulent flow means that there are eddys and currents inside the crude crashing around, going up and down. Then, there are all the tiny particles crashing around. That creates a huge amount of drag and reduces the speed it can be moved at, and costs a lot more energy to move it all. Like, millions of dollars in electricity costs per year for one pump station. This the technology both reduces the surface area of the particulate matter in the crude oil, making it so more of the volume is liquid rather than particulate -- that is obvious -- and also turns a turbulent flow regime into a linear flow regime. That is what leads to a reduction in pump power of 75%, presumably.

The above is a very simplistic explanation. All this material is out there. Again, this appears to be real, and it's a big deal.

QUALIFICATIONS

This is a high risk, potential high return company. It's a penny stock that has burned through tens of millions in shareholder capital trying to 'hit it big'. It had dodgy management about a decade ago. Take all that for what it's worth. At the moment they appear to have strong management, and a viable technology that is being tested by the majors — i.e. TransCanada already, and Kinder Morgan now — and as I see it, quite high chances of success.

**GMAN** appears to up on, what else?: (http://finance.yahoo.com/news/freds-posts-line-q4-earnings-135001428.html) It really squeezed up a lot after that news came out. Expecting 1 of 2 things. 1: The stock will parabolic in the morning up to 8 and will begin to pullback. I will go short risking off the peak. 2: the stock gaps up over 8 and begins to parabolic over 8. Expecting it to begin pulling back at around 8 - 8.30. In an odd case where the stock begins to washout, I will go short risking off the high of the day.

**GENE** is a dead cat bounce. It really began to ramp after holding support really well. This stock can really ramp up so I would be seriously careful about shorting. The Float is 3.89M so as usual be careful of serious floatroation and ""crowded trades"". I will only be shorting this stock if the stock begins to really parabolic and begins to hold up around a whole/half dollar mark. DO NOT TOUCH IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR!


**REFR** I am not exactly sure why this stock is up so much. I am not going to jump to any conclusions just yet. It will depend highly if the stock can break over 6.6 in the morning, if it can't I will go short risking of it. If the stock gaps up and begins to parabolic, I will look to short if the stock shows weakness around whole/half dollar marks. 



**RADA** realllllly squeezed around 2:30 today. I will only short this stock if it: Over extends with another big parabolic toward 2.8, or the stock begins to washout. Ideally the stock washes out and holds under 2.6, then I will go short risking off it.

Hey guys, recently there was a guy that posted that he was holding onto the ticker THCZ. He appeared to be completely unaware that this stock was a pump and dump. The post could be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/30uttl/march_30_2015_tomorrows_daily_rpennystocks/cpw3abf
 He said:

&gt;I've been in on THCZ since it was .09, it's still climbing. **An article today said it's gone parabolic**. I bought with the intention of making a quick turnaround but I'm probably going to hold this even if it dips soon, and maybe** buy more**. I have no idea where this will start to turn around. 

Luckily I gave this guy advice already, I hope he takes it into consideration and actually listens. Probably the scariest thing you could do is to add add add into a pump and dump (on the long side obviously). 


-

I am not sure how many of you realize this, but like 99% of OTC stocks that run up are pump and dumps. 
-

If you don't already know , it can be extremely dangerous to hold a pump and dump. Personally I love to short pump and dumps because there are usually a lot of ""longs"" that are suckers for this kind of stuff. 

So what can you do to know if the stock you are getting into is getting pumped? Simple, there is a website called: stockpromoters.com (I am not advertising them, they were just the only one that I found that could find newsletter pumps). If you go to this website, make an account and type in the ticker in the search bar. You will be able to find out if your stock currently is being promoted (check the dates of course!). 

So please, do not BUY into pump and dumps unless you are willing to lose a LOT. Hoped you learned something :D

Good luck! Any questions feel free to ask below",11

15-03-31,die my pretties,"[Short SPY through earnings](http://imgur.com/Ewr4wlR)

I just don't see optimism.  No energy company can post a good quarter, for every positive from one tech company there's another tech giant that's struggling (like GOOG, INTC, MSFT, etc), the only positive numbers have been out of health care and retail but the sector ETFs tracking those are already trading at multiples approaching historical correction territory (XLV at 22 and XLY/XRT right near 20), banks probably have upside but not until we get closer to the first rate hike.

In summary, I don't think health care and retail can carry this market anymore, and I think retail earnings misses because of the weather in the past quarter can trigger the selloff.  There were bad retail sales surprises last week and the market largely ignored them, buying the dip and sending XLY, for example, right back up within ~0.5% of 52 week highs as of today.

My only long ATM is AAPL with a basis of 123 and change, and have a call sold on it close for this Friday.  I can't find any other obvious winners, I'm predicting the correction.  Will be digging into paper on individual companies trying to find more losers over the rest of the week, might short some individual names as well.",22

* **GBSN** has Float: 2.16M.

A lot of people are being squeezed and people are buying into the hype. That only makes the movement that much more volatile. The stock price will depend heavily on how it reacts around 4.15 and 4.50. If the stock is unable to break one of those points, I will go short risking off the peak. There are a lot of potential profit takers so if the stock doesn't break out immediately it could just washout (not likely but it is possible). Only shorting parabolic moves / failing to break whole/half dollar marks. 



* **GMAN** will depend a lot on how it reacts toward that 8.25 mark. If it is unable to hold right away I will be expecting a washout and will go short. If the stock somehow begins to parabolic, I will wait until it it starts to show weakness and failing to break to new high of days. I will be shorting the ""back side of the move"" on this one.




* **RADA** really didn't do a great job breaking and holding 3. If the stock is unable to break 3 right off the bat, I will go short risking off that mark. If the stock begins to washout, I will go short risking off 2.90 (previous days close). 




* **PED** I am watching just in case.


Any questions ask below! Just to clarify, if I say I set a risk, I mean I am pretty much setting a ""mental stoploss"". IT DOES NOT MEAN I WILL BE OUT AT THAT MARK, I will be out if the stock cannot hold under my set risk.
