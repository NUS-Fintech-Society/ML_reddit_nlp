15-04-01,Canadian economy enters 2015 on soft footing,"The Canadian economy contracted by 0.1% in January, beating market expectations for a 0.2% drop.  This marks the second decline in the last three months. Weakness in services industries (-0.3%) was to blame, although it was partially offset by increased production in the goods-producing sector (+0.3%).

""Despite the stronger-than-expected headline figure, it was still a weak reading and the underlying details of the report suggest further weakness may be in store.  As such, the impact from the plunge in oil prices is likely to become much more apparent going forward.  We continue to expect growth to be relatively flat in Q1."" TD Economics said in a report on Tuesday

Going forward, ongoing strength in the U.S. economy and a weak loonie should help to bolster demand for Canadian-made goods, which certainly bodes well for Canada's export sector.  Moreover, as oil prices begin to recover towards the end of this year and into 2016, business and consumer sentiment should follow suit, helping to buoy the overall economy.  

""We expect Canada's economic activity to bounce back above 2% (annualized) in the second half of this year, following a subdued pace of growth in H1.  This should allow the Bank of Canada to keep the overnight rate as is through 2015 and into 2016.  We continue to expect rates to remain on hold until the final quarter of 2016."" added TD Economics

""The Fed’s actions determine the money supply and thus short-term interest rates; it has no choice but to set the short-term interest rate somewhere. So where should that be? The best strategy for the Fed I can think of is to set rates at a level consistent with the healthy operation of the economy over the medium term, that is, at the (today, low) equilibrium rate.""",5

15-04-01,"Tomorrow is my 18th birthday and I think I'm *almost* ready!","Sorry for the shit tittle first off.

Well as the *shitty* title says tomorrow I am finally legal to trade stocks and I couldn't be more excited. I've been following stocks, reading up on stuff about them, and I think I got the basis.

I've been following $ECIG, $THCZ, and $HZNP for awhile now.

My grandparents have set aside money for me since I was still crawling, and they've agreed to give it to me tomorrow. I'll be receiving about $2k-$3k for stocks, rest for college.

The question in the matter however is what is your opinions on how I should go about these trades?

For starters: Which online broker would you best recommend? I have my eyes on TradeKing and Robbinhood for some smaller trades. (Already have both apps installed waiting to sign up when I turn 18.)

Second, I understand (Especially from this subreddit since it's asked quite often asked) that $2,000-$3,000 is definitely not a lot of money for stocks. However I know it's a slow start. I'm pretty sure these are the three stocks I'd like to put some money in, what percentage should I split them up about?

70% $HZNP, 25% $THCZ, 5% $ECIG?? Does this sound like a safe bet? I get 25% into a penny stock and then 5% in the other is REALLY risky but it would help increase my portfolio worth faster than anything. 

Do these three stocks sound appealing for a first buy or would anyone recommend anything else? Maybe some bonds? Or Dividend stocks? I'm just looking for some open discussion! 

Thanks in advance!

15-04-01,How to diversify $35K and invest for 5 years,"I have around $35k to invest for about 5 years until I am ready to purchase a home. I currently have a mortgage, a vehicle loan, and no other investments other than my husband's TSP which we contribute to each month. Since we already have a mortgage, we are hoping to invest and forget about the money until we need a bigger home, hence the five year timeline. I am considering investing in mutual funds which I will try to manage myself (again, the plan being to buy and ""forget about"" if possible).  How do I diversify my portfolio? What is the appropriate amount of risk? I am comfortable with a moderate amount I think, but I don't want to wake up one day and have $10K gone either. Are mutual funds my best bet? Where should I buy them, and which ones should I research? What else am I missing, forgetting, or needing to research further? ",6
15-04-01,TIFU by dropping a cheerio and blinding myself with a juice box straw,"Obligatory this didn't happen two days ago, it happened a few hours ago.

Today is my day off from work, and as such I was surfing reddit eating my cheerios in peace at my desk. I should mention that I recently saw a post about cheap healthy snacks on reddit and now keep a box of honey nut O's at my desk at all times.

So the fuck up came when a lone cheerio fell from grace as it miraculously avoided ingestion and maneuvered its way onto the floor beside my chair. As I reached down to grab the cheerio I forgot about the juice box that lay waiting on my desk like a trap door spider awaiting its prey. I scootched my chair back and proceeded to lean forward to pick up the fallen comrade, when out of no where I felt a sharp jabbing pain in my eyeball. I threw my head back in a fit of agony and to my surprise my juice box came flying at me like it was some kind of ninja grabbing on for dear life. I had embedded the juice box into part of my eye to then have it detach and fall into my lap. At this point there is a searing pain in my eye, my vision has gone hazy, and there is a complete circular halo in my field of vision that is moving around as I try to sort out what happened.

Fast forward to the ER visit... No one has ever heard of a juice box straw doing this much damage to someones cornea. I have a specialist appointment with some super optometrist to determine if my vision is correctable or salvageable tomorrow, but there is very little they could do for me other than give me medication for the pain and clean the eye of particulates until I go in to see the specialist tomorrow.

TL;DR I played Jokers famous disappearing trick on myself with a juice box straw and found out he was not fucking around.

15-04-01,Suffering in silence and pitty,"One of the hardest things about going through this process is that your emotions are all over the place. People either don't know what you are going through because its such a personal problem that even the next of kin aren't told or they do know that you are ""trying"" and think every time you're quiet or having a moment of reflection that you must be dying on the inside.
For example, I go with my sister, nephew and father to lunch. My dad says something along the lines of ""You should just take him home with you"" regarding my nephew. My thoughts jump to ""what does he mean by that? take my nephew because its something I love to do even though my sister hasn't asked me to, or as a joke to go raise my nephew"" as everyone knows I would if it came down to that. Both scenarios are entirely possible the way my dad meant it, and it was out of the blue - not like my sister asked me to watch him. So when he says that, I'm confused, and then he follows up with ""You ok? you seem awfully quiet today."" I felt like saying ""Well no, you're saying odd things to me that make wonder what your intention is. No one wants to take my nephew (for the weekend or otherwise) and my earning for a child doesn't make me want to kidnap my nephew, in case that's what you meant.""
I also had a work situation where I was traveling, my period was seven days late and although I suspected I wasn't pregnant I was still devastated while surrounded by my coworkers. I acted in a way that wasn't indicative of the person I am - but of course, I couldn't explain my personal problems in my defense.
I'm just sick of the judgement, the silent suffering, the gossip I know is happening in the family. I'm just over this whole situation. I just want to know what my life will be.
On the upside, I was blabbering all this to my 40 year old friend who is unmarried and who moves around and changes jobs a fair amount and she said - ""No one knows what their life is going to be 3 years down the road."" I guess she's right.

15-04-01,"I was a part of Queen's Guard in England - One of the rare jobs where you aren't allowed to move, no matter what stands in front of you.","This happened to my brother-in-law two years ago. I am telling the story exactly the way he told me it. He appeared very genuine when telling it, and, you know what, after all that's happened to me, I have no reason not believe him. And as for you, well, you be the judge.

I was in the English army, you know? Two tours in Iraq, one in Afghanistan. My mom absolutely hated the life I chose, and I can’t really blame her. But you know what? The fucked up part is that the biggest horror I’ve ever experienced wasn’t in one of those shitty eastern places, no, it was in the very center of European “civilization”, London.

After I finished my third tour, I was awarded by the army. Apparently, surviving fighting Taliban in the mountains is reason enough to be honored. They offered me a spot in Queen’s Guard. I’m not sure how much you know about that, but in England, it’s a pretty big deal. And I hated it. I was permanently stationed at home, and as a reward for my “bravery” I was now standing in front of buildings motionless while annoying Chinese tourists tried to make me laugh. I wanted out, but the honor of the position, combined with my mother’s happiness that the biggest danger I could ever face would be an Asian tourist, I had no choice but to do it. Only if I knew I’d be safer in some cave in Kabul…

So I was stationed to work at the Tower of London few shifts a week. Shifts were usually 2-3 hours long, depending on how many people worked that day. Gotta tell you, that job gets old quickly. Drunk people who try to mess with you along with annoying tourists who think they’re the first ones ever to try to make you laugh, you just want out of your own skin. But it was a job, and it paid, so I shut the fuck up and did it.

Now, this one day, this one day in 2012 started boring as any other day. I had a few French guys trying to mess with me (god they’re the worst, and you can’t do shit unless they threaten you), then I had a group of drunk Russian chicks which wasn’t so bad. The heat was just starting to melt that fucking hat into my skull when a huge group of tourists showed up. Some sort of a guided tour, I assumed. They all did their standard spiel, pictures, “funny” faces, jokes, etc. They all had their cameras out, and they all wore same t-shirts, some Big Ben tour bullshit. All but one. I noticed her standing in the back, just staring at me. She was a good looking woman, probably early forties, really dark long hair and somewhat pale, which made me think she was English. She did seem to be the part of the tour as she stood with all of the others.

After the group finally took enough pictures and realized I wasn’t gonna laugh, they started moving on. Except the pale woman who stayed and kept watching me. Now, I’ve seen my fair share of people doing all kinds of stupid stuff to get a reaction out of me, but this was a new one. Not only that, this lady was committed. Two hours and hundreds of tourists later, she still stood in the very same spot, just staring at me. The day got pretty hot and there was no way she was comfortable, but I shit you not, she was calmer than I was. She wasn’t smiling which was strange because I assumed she was trying to make me react. About thirty minutes later, when the crowd around me slowly died out, she took a slow step towards me. Then another one. “Here we go, joke incoming” I thought as she took her sweet time walking up closer.

She stopped about two feet away from me. She was looking straight into my eyes. Tilted her head to the left, then to the right, which I assumed was her attempt at making me laugh. Then I realized this woman wasn’t here to joke around. Still standing at two feet away, she started leaning towards me. There was something just so fucked up about her mannerisms that made me extremely uneasy. She never lost an eye contact with me. She kept leaning towards me while her feet never moved. Her face stopped just short of touching mine and her position seemed unnatural at that point. Her head started slowly shaking, like when you get out of the pool or a shower and are freezing, you know?

And then, then she scared the fucking shit out of me. I had people screaming in my face, I even had a moron trying to fight me, but what she did was by far the worst. She opened her mouth as if she were about to let the loudest scream at me, but nothing came out. Nothing. She just stood there, leaned at an unnatural angle, inches from my face, letting a fucking silent scream or whatever that was out of her wide open mouth. And the speed of her shaking increased. Now, I’m not gonna lie, even though it was really hot that day, I started feeling cold and goosebumps ran under my uniform. I finally got myself together and started marching away from her – we are allowed to do a 10-step march occasionally.

When I got to the end of one way, I stopped and closed my eyes. I just wanted her to be gone when I turned around. As I made a 180 degree turn, I instantly froze. She was right in front of me; leaned all the way to my face, mouth open even wider, head now shaking uncontrollably. I was so taken aback, I was unable to react. Noise, screaming, and other stuff I can deal with, but this silent creepy fucking behavior was honestly intimidating me.

“Make way for the Queens Guard!” I yelled. We are allowed to say that when someone is in our way. She didn’t react, but she did lean farther to about an inch from my face.

“MAKE WAY FOR THE QUEEN’S GUARD” I yelled even louder, hoping my voice wouldn’t break.

She had absolutely zero regard for my orders. Unwilling to deal with the bullshit any longer, I stepped back and pointed my bayonet at her. That was our last resort for annoying tourists.

She immediately closed her mouth and leaned back into a normal human position. I wasn’t going to wait for her to do whatever she was about to do, so I started marching around her. When I got back to my post, I turned around and stood still. I couldn’t see her in the corner of my eye which gave me a huge relief. “Jesus, this fucking job” I thought to myself “I’m gonna have to look into…”

“10, 9, 8” someone whispered in my right ear. It must be her. She was behind me.

“10, 9, 8” whispers came from my left side. Goosebumps were at an all-time erect now. Hilarious, isn’t it? Combat vet, killed more people than he’d ever want to admit, is now scared to hell of some batshit tourist lady.

“10, 9, 8, 10, 9, 8, 10, 9, 8” she sped up her whispering. Then walked in front of me. “10, 9, 8, 10, 9, 8” she was now whispering incredibly fast. Actually, whispering doesn’t describe it properly. It was like yelling, but in a whisper tone, if that makes any sense. It was surreal. She leaned towards my face again, whispering those fucking numbers franticly.

I was about to break my orders. I couldn’t take it anymore. There was something fucked up about this woman, and I couldn’t deal with it.

“Ma’m,” I spoke in a voice of the biggest scared pussy, “Ma’m will you please step…”

And then, a huge group of loud tourist ran up to us. The crazy woman leaned back, still looking at me. She whispered “10, 9, 8” one more time while never losing an eye contact. Then she walked away, as slowly as she moved around me. It was so strange watching her slowly disappear into the crowd. All that was left was a strange feeling of something unnatural. That, and a group of life-saving Asian tourists. Never thought I’d be so happy to see a Nikon-snapping Chinese guy.

After my shift was done, I went into our base and told the story to a couple of guys. They all had some experience with creepy people, but never on this level. When our shift commander came, guys jokingly told him how I was “abused” on duty. He wanted some laughs, so he asked for the full story. But when I started telling what happened, he quickly lost his smile.

“Stop, stop,” he said. “Did you talk to her?”

“Sir?” I asked intrigued.

“Son, did you or did you not speak to this woman?”

I wasn’t gonna lose my weekly pay over breaking that stupid no-talking rule, so I lied. “Of course not, sir.”

He seemed to calm down. “Good. And if she ever comes back, never talk back, understood? And that goes for all of you.”

Joking atmosphere quickly died out in the break room. I was puzzled, but I was even more tired, so I decided to go home and sleep instead of worrying about crazy fucking tourists.

Next few shifts went by as boring as they were supposed to be. Woman was nowhere to be seen, and since my girlfriend was about to visit me all the way from Netherlands, I forgot about the incident.

Tuesday night around 3am, I was awoken by loud banging at the door. For some strange reason, the first thought that crossed my mind was that fucked up woman from a week ago.

“Babe, would you mind peeping through the hole to see who it is?” I lazily mumbled as I gently pushed my girlfriend. She was dead asleep; I swear nothing could wake her up. Semi-conscious, I stumbled through the hallway and to the door. “Who is it?” I muttered while peeking through the hole, but it was too dark outside. That sobered me up. “Who is it?” I asked again, but the only answer I got was louder banging.

“Fuck it” I thought as I took a deep breath and opened the door.

There are about million things I’d rather see standing in front of me at that moment. And there was only one person I did not expect to be at the door.

My girlfriend.

I was supposed to pick her up tonight.

I nearly lost all control of my legs. Thousand things raced through my mind which was having trouble comprehending what in the fuck was happening.

“Thanks for picking me up at the Heathrow, asshole,” my girlfriend said as she slammed the carryon on my chest. I was still speechless.

“So, I travel all the way from Amsterdam to see you, and you forget? Really?”

I wasn’t hearing it. I knew I was half asleep when I got up, but there WAS someone in my bed. I wasn’t dreaming for fuck’s sake.

“Stay here” I mumbled as I handed her the bag back.

“What’s wrong?”

“Just stay here.”

Not knowing where I got the courage to walk to the bedroom, I slowly made my way.

I know what you’re thinking – in movies and books, guy walks into the room and boom, its empty, right? I fucking wish.

I walked into my room and it was completely dark. But I could hear breathing. Heavy breathing. My pulse was so high I was sure I was gonna pass out, but I flipped the switch.

“7, 6, 5, 7, 6, 5” whispers came from the corner of the room where she stood. That same fucking woman. She stood almost glued to the corner of the room, her back to the wall. She was looking straight at me. And though I was sure I lost the power of speech, I managed to squeeze out a “What the fuck”.

“7, 6, 5” she said as she took the first slow step towards me. Her mouth was always wide open, as if she were letting out that damn soundless scream. Every step she’d make, she’d close her mouth enough to say “7, 6, 5”.

I couldn’t move. Nothing in this world existed besides this woman slowly walking towards me. What a creepy and unsettling feeling. Like, I wasn’t physically afraid of her, right? I could take her down – and was ready to. But this kind of fear was something foreign to me. Seemed like I was afraid for my, shit, I don’t know, soul? You know what I mean? I knew she couldn’t hurt me physically, but I was stills scared. Not to mention I fucking somehow slept in the same bed with this whatever the fuck she is.

She came incredibly close to me. The familiar lean. An inch from my face. My breathing was so irregular and loud, it was the only noise in the room.

“7, 6, 5.”

Suddenly, something about this had a strangely familiar feeling.

“WHAT THE FUCK?!” scream came from behind me.

My girlfriend.

I snapped into reality, turned around and grabbed my girl. “Run!” I yelled as we escaped the room. We ran to the kitchen where I grabbed one of those “As seen on TV” steel-cutting knives. My girlfriend was just silently weeping at my side, unable to even ask questions.

I could hear footsteps. First, I saw her shadow, then I saw her calmly walking through the hallway. Her mouth was now so unnaturally wide open, and she wasn’t looking at me anymore. She was looking at the ceiling as she slowly made her way to the door. Her head was shaking very fast. It was abso-fucking-lutely surreal, I’m telling you. I mean, just imagine, this woman, who creeped you out a week ago, is now walking through your place at 3 in the morning, staring at the ceiling with mouth impossibly wide open. Not to mention you slept next to her for who knows how long.

When she finally walked out, I ran to the door and slammed it. Girlfriend was still unable to speak. When we got ourselves together, I was afraid she’d think I cheated on her with this woman, but she didn’t. She saw that horror walk through out hallway and she knew something was wrong.

I was terrified, but I didn’t let it show. The scariest part of everything was that I had a job that required me to stand still and not react to my surroundings. I told my girlfriend about my experience with this fucked up woman, but I didn’t mention her “10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5” whispers. I didn’t want to scare her any further.

Because , what could those whispers be if not a countdown?

15-04-01,Getting Married in Heaven,"On their way to get married, a young Catholic couple is involved in a fatal car accident. The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him.

St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.

The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.

'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'

'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'

St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.

'OH, COME ON!', St. Peter shouted, 'It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer ?

It’s already 2015 but the ARMy of 64-bit server processors have yet to make any serious design wins from major data center operators.

15-04-01,"Micron (MU) - Earnings Report today, does it rise or fall tomorrow?? Here's my reasoning and why I believe it will be a drop.","I have a sense that MU is going to make a big move in one direction tomorrow. I've decided to stay out of this one because of the following reasons:  

**Reasons to Buy**  
    - Announced a partnership with Intel to deliver 3D SSD, which will be an amazing technology.  
    - 3D SSD (unlike Samsung's alternative) will use the same components as SSD. Ie lower manufacturing transition costs.  
    - Traded a shrinking part of their business to one of their suppliers for reduced component costs, ideally making MU more profitable.  
    - Expectations seem very low for earnings, by many measures (PE, Price-Sales) the stock seems cheap

**Reasons to sell**  
    - 3D SSD will be require more components than SSD. Will they be able to maintain their margins? (ie will it be as profitable?)  
    - Why were margins such a concern that they gave away part of their business? Will they be able to maintain the same profitability on 3d SSD as  they did on SSD?  
    - Lots of insider sells. In the last 3 months, [1 buy to 10 sells](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/mu/insider-trades).  
    - Manufacturing transition, however small, will hurt margins. Moreover, they're going to have inventory management challenges.  
    - SanDisk (SNDK), a director competitor recently took a 16% drop on their ER.  
    - Apple, who accounts for a not-so-small percentage of sales recently announced they will be diversifying into some Samsung memory. It seems the Apple-Samsung feud is over, this might not be a good thing for MU.  

Any thoughts?? Anyone want to predict a rise/drop??  
My money's on a drop, but I'm there's a good chance I wake up tomorrow with lots of regret. ",7

15-04-01,MEn are not happy.,"About once every month or two, there’s a post somewhere on Reddit, by a woman, saying something like, “My boyfriend suddenly started doing Red Pill stuff and now I want out,” followed by 4-6 paragraphs explaining how her boyfriend is now a controlling, abusive asshole who works out and wants sex (because these traits are, of course, very, very unique to The Red Pill, and any guy who exhibits them obviously went online, found us, and we ruined him). These threads get seized upon by our detractors, who eagerly point out: “See? See!? The Red Pill doesn’t ‘work’ ! It just ends relationships and turns guys into assholes!”

Independent of what is and is not actually “Red Pill behavior,” situations like these are based a bad assumption. Simply put, in examples like this, the lamenting woman has presupposed that prior to her man’s “changes”, their relationship was actually good, and he was actually happy. Then he ruined everything by reading some bullshit online that told him how his relationship ought to be, then trying to implement it.

This begs the question: If the relationship was fine before the boyfriend went all Red Pill on his woman, why is he trying to change things? Why did he go on the internet and seek out the manosphere? If he’s happy with his relationship the way it is, why is he trying to find ways to improve his sex life and become more assertive? (All of this, of course, assumes that a) the stories presented on Reddit are true; and b) the man actually sought out The Red Pill and didn’t just stop kissing his girlfriend’s ass for any number of other reasons.)

The Red Pill is here because men aren’t happy. They don’t want to be sweet and sensitive and do things for women all day long and be the “perfect boyfriend,” while having subpar sex once every six weeks, paying out the ass for expensive dates and gifts, sacrificing personal time, and getting bitched at and threatened with a break-up if any of this perfect behavior ever dips slightly. They don’t want to give backrubs and footrubs, stay at home one weekend a month while their women have a night out with the girls, get disrespected and talked about behind their backs, get cheated on (but just harmless, meaningless mistakes that don’t really count!), and get berated when they push back against any of this. They don’t want to let women move in, rent-free, and get pressured to buy a ring for a four-digit number of dollars and tie their finances to someone who makes less than half as much money, just because they’ve been “dating awhile” and “it’s time” and they’re “supposed to.”

Sure, everything’s hunky-dory for these girlfriends, but for the men, everything is NOT happy. Everything is NOT going well. And men are sick of it.

When a 28-year-old man with an entitled bitch of a girlfriend of 5 years stumbles across the Red Pill, he reads stories about men not so much older than he is who don’t have or want girlfriends. They don’t need a girlfriend because they have four or five women fucking their brains out on a regular basis outside of a relationship. They barely spend a cent on dates or activities. They barely lift a finger to impress women. But girls can’t seem to get enough of them.

And what these men do seems so simple. Work out, focus on your career, practice your social skills and get confident, develop useful skills and interesting hobbies – essentially, quit wasting time. Read non-fiction instead of fiction, watch less TV, play less video games, quit jerking off to porn, spend that time doing something that makes you physically, mentally, or socially better. The Red Pill tells men that their time is valuable, and to use it well. Hand in hand with that, The Red Pill tells men that since their time is their most valuable resource, quit wasting it on women when you’re not getting something of equal value in return. If your girlfriend is ugly, sexually ungenerous, lazy, or just an entitled bitch that expects you to do all kinds of crap for her just to maintain the pleasure of having a girlfriend, is it really worth all of the time and energy you expend? When you could be doing something that actually improves your life?

The Red Pill exists because many men aren’t happy. Because these relationships that are allegedly “just fine” are very much NOT just fine. Because men are giving so much to their women and getting so little, with the assumption that merely existing – merely being a presence in the man’s life – is all a woman needs to do to become his highest priority. That men should be falling over themselves getting in line for the right to say “I have a girlfriend,” and nothing more. Men are sick of this.

Guys in the “my man went Red Pill and ruined our relationship” Reddit posts probably aren’t actually going to internet sites to get an instruction manual for how to piss off their girlfriends. They’re just normal guys who know in the pit of their stomach that something is wrong – that they’re wasting their lives, and that they’re not happy. It’s not their girlfriends’ fault, it’s theirs. And they decide one day, for whatever reason, to try to take control of their lives, of their relationships, and build something they’re actually proud of. And steps 1 and 2 of that process involve asserting yourself and living the way you want, and expecting the people with whom you associate (e.g., your woman) to add value to your life equal to the value you’re expending. The rest of the world shorthands that behavior as “being an asshole,” and “ruining relationships.” How sad is that? Honestly and confidently pursuing the life you want, and expecting others to hold up their end of a relationship is the new Hitler.",1

15-04-01,[Poll] Feedback on stock tool,"Hi guys,

A friend and I have been working on a technical trading alert program for a long time and I have a few questions.  First let me describe the tool.  You manually enter as many stocks as you want into your ""watchlist"" and throughout the day the program monitors all of these stocks.  You then set alerts for whatever technical indicators you like.  Perhaps it is a moving average, MACD convergence, or RSI.  We have incorporated all popular indicators and will update with more as time goes on.   Lets use the 50 day moving average as an example.  When stock ABC crosses the 50 day moving average you would get an alert telling you that it did.  This can be done with as many indicators and as many stocks as you like.  

Now I have a few questions...

1.  Would you pay for a service like this?
2.  Would you rather pay a small monthly fee or a larger one time purchase fee?
3.  Do you have any criticisms or suggestions for our tool?

2) Allows specifying asset category (broad stuff, like ""these are US bonds, these are US stocks, these are international stocks, etc"")

4) Based on individual account value and type (tax-advantaged, not tax advantaged, etc), recommends allocation of asset categories for each account in the portfolio

5) Specifies allocation of new funds to a particular account (buy $X in YYY, etc) so that #3 and #4 continue to hold true

Last year I received options from my then employer and exercised some before our IPO.  After our IPO I ended up exercising the rest.  Once I had all the shares I transferred them to a brokerage account.

Now my second transaction is all filled out appropriately (which was done automatically) but the first transaction is listed as ""non-covered"" and wants me to update the information.  **My question is how do I edit the acquired date on the pre-IPO shares?  Is it when I exercised them, or the date of the IPO when I actually had shares to sell?**

Secondary question, what exactly does ""covered"" vs ""non-covered"" mean?  I assume it has something to do with them being able to verify the information with documents/proof as opposed to just whatever I type in.  Is it possible for me to make the first transaction ""covered"" like my second?  Any reason why it would not be covered in the first place?

I still have the documents from the account that held the shares before I transferred them, what information should I look for on them?

If I know anything, it's that if things look too good to be true, they probably are.  I'm reading up on these PPNs, and it looks like, yes, there is no cap, HOWEVER, if the market rises or falls by say, more than 25% the investor only gets the principal back (edit: not sure if this is the US, or Canada).

15-04-02,Bond ETF reactions to interest rates,"So, I understand the mechanics of buying an individual bond, and its relation to interest rates. However, its unclear to me how it works in an ETF, which has many bonds with many different maturity dates. 

In an environment where I expect interest rates to rise, then I would probably want an etf holding a higher percentage of short term bonds, right? But then again, long term bonds must have higher yields to account for uncertainy/risk...

If higher interest rates are a proxy for economic growth (or at least inflation), then are bond etfs counter cyclical, sort of like gold? In other words, if I expect sustained interest rate increases for the next few years (as an example), should I bother to buy bond ETFs? (timing the market etc, aside)

I hope i'm not trying to oversimplify something that's more complex. Clearly i'm clueless, so any clarification is appreciated. 
Note: I will be buying a Canadian bond etf such as XQB or VAB (on the TSX).",44

One such example is Global Partners ($GLP), who surprised consensus EPS estimates by 55% last quarter. Most of its revenue is uncorrelated to oil prices, and the stock is now trading at an extremely attractive valuation. Strong sales, earnings, dividend, and free cash flow yields. No wonder insiders have doubled their positions over the last 3 months, institutions have put another 10% into the stock, and its short float is a tiny 0.5%.

**THCZ** I rarely watch otc stocks but this stock is just nuts. First off it is up on this: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/totally-hemp-crazy-inc-signs-distribution-agreement-for-the-rocky-mountain-high-brands-with-a-large-established-texas-based-distribution-company-2015-04-01?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts) and all the newsletters that are pumping it. Long story short, there are a lot of ""sheep"" in this stock so if it was going to washout, it could realllly washout. The higher it goes the better. Shorting this stocks first red day, I will be using level 2 heavily with this stock to determine an entry point (beware of level 2 fake bids/asks).

**GBSN** I actually fell for a trap today, it was sooo bad and it snapped my 7 day profit streak. It was because of it being a ""crowded trade""and because of ""float rotation"". Anyway, expecting one of 2 things. 1: The stock parabolics to the 4.75 - 5.10 mark, I will get short risking off the peak. 2: the stock can't hold above 4.5 and I will go short risking off that mark. Beware of float rotation :/

**NYMX** is clearly up on this: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/nymox-announces-phase-3-bph-studies-2015-04-01?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts). Hard to short a stock with phase 3 news (even if the news was barely anything). It will depend highly on if the stock is able to hold 1.20, if it can't I will go short risking off it. In a weird situation where the stock parabolics, I will only go short if it fails to break 1.40.

**GMAN** shorted overnight, out immediately if it doesn't washout

Any questions ask below! Sorry for such few stocks, there was not much else.

http://im.ft-static.com/content/images/55b27a7e-d87c-11e4-ba53-00144feab7de.pdf

* Current list of reforms are much more detailed compared to the one sent on Friday, which was not up to the mark according to the inspectors of Brussels group.

* Current document says all previous privatization would be honored, however future ones will be handled case to case basis.

* Despite this comprehensive list, recent talks suggest that inspectors remain partially satisfied over the list especially with pension reforms part, that suggested in addition fiscal spending of € 1.1 billion. They also pose doubts, over the claim by the government to raise as much as € 6 billion this year.

* According to sources familiar to the matter, resolution might not come until the next Euro zone finance minister meeting that is scheduled April 24, 2015, well past the due date of 9th April to pay IMF € 0.45 billion.

Macroeconomic assumptions in the reform document are GDP growth for 2015 to be 2.9% and 3.6% for 2016. Authorities believe inflation to reach 1.1% by 2016 and unemployment to 19.5%.

* These base line assumptions pose doubts of its true ability to reach such levels and might be too optimistic.

15-04-02,Need some limit order help.,"My broker is TDA and the last few trades have been weird. Today I had a short position limit order set for 10.45 (as my entry) on FOLD, but I got filled at 10.95. The definition of limit price is 'at the price or better.' After speaking with them, they said that this price was better for me but I kept arguing with them that that spread is way too high to have been filled as 'better.'

This happened yesterday as well where I got filled on an equity 10 cents higher on a short position (entry was supposed to be at 5.47, but I got entered at 5.57) and I had to close out the position after it kept moving higher which cost me a round-trip use and commission fees. Likewise on a long position I had as well which filled me 8 cents lower on a sub5 stock. Entry was 2.50, they filled my limit at 2.42.

Should I be fighting this? I called them already and it seemed like their only solution was to use stop-limits in the future. i mean those spreads are rather high, especially FOLD ($0.50 between my initial entry and what they considered my purchase price, which the price never reached).

and here's the def of the limit order:
&gt;""Limit Orders
A limit order indicates the highest price you are willing to pay for a security, or the lowest price you are willing to accept to sell a security. Your order will be executed at your designated price or better. This helps protect your order from sudden volatility, **but it also means you will only buy or sell the security if it reaches the price you're seeking**. A limit order also allows you to specify a time period for your order to remain active-it will seek to completely fill your order at your limit price until the time period ends, after which your order will expire.""

None of those prices were reached.

15-04-02,70% of investors are making basic mistakes which could double returns and improve Sharpe ratio [X-Post from r/dataisbeautiful],"TL:DR; We analyzed data from 25,000 investors and found that being above average on 4 key metrics on average doubles investment returns and improves risk adjusted performance by &gt;200%.

More detail on the data:

70% of personal investors fail on one or more common investing mistakes that can significantly affect performance. We analyzed 25,000 investor portfolios to measure the impact of 4 vital metrics:

1) diversification, 2) volatility, 3) trade frequency and 4) cash allocation.

30% of investors passed (i.e. are better than average) on all 4 metrics – these investors have one year returns that are double those that fail on two or more metrics and 50% better than investors failing just one test.

On a risk-adjusted basis there is a staggering 2.3x improvement in performance between those that pass all metrics and those that miss one or more. (The Sharpe ratio, a performance metric that adjusts for risk, improves from 0.24 to 0.78 for users that are above average on all metrics).

While holding less cash and trading less often are self-explanatory, diversifying and managing volatility are actually correlated to another simple behavior: more funds. Users who passed both diversification and volatility tests had a Fund/Stock ratio of 75%/25%. Users that fail both? 15%/85% the other way. By allocating more into diversified funds, ETFs, or fund based automated services like Wealthfront and Betterment, investors could see performance improvements and reduced risk exposure.

The result? Surprisingly good. I made a killing on Fiat ($FCAU) among others, but have others which are just hitting the bed.

One of these is $RYAM, Rayonier Advanced Materials. They are a producer of cellulose from wood fibers, cellulose which among other uses is for cigarette filters.

Back in October, Morningstar rated the stock as a 5-star BUY rating, with a price target nearly 50% higher than the price at the time, around $30/share. Without doing my own research and trusting that Morningstar could predict the performance of the stock, I blindly bought about $3000, about 1/10 of my portfolio.

Six months of abysmal performance, Morningstar continues to give the BUY; UNDERVALUED designation for the stock. I have already lost 50% of my principal, and even doubled down after one day where it sunk 11%.

15-04-02,"How I'm investing $30,000 in deep value stocks and sharing my approach, research and outcomes with you","Over the long term, I believe that the best way to grow personal wealth is through responsible investing - Putting money into high-quality funds and letting them accrue value over time.

Although I know that many people prefer to just stick to retirement funds, ETFs or simple index trackers, I also think that there's value to be found in building a portfolio of decent, well-valued individual stocks. Recently, I've been using an app called 'Simply Wall Street' to find discounted, quality stocks to invest in.

I've written a series of three blog posts on the approach that I am taking, my investment philosophy and the stocks that I have chosen as a result of my research. I'm also providing public access to my portfolio so that people can track my performance.

*Please note that the articles posted below are simply guest blogging articles that were unsolicited and written by me. I have not received compensation of any kind for these articles and the only gain or loss that I stand to make is through my personal investments in my portfolio (which I am sharing openly). I'm not intending for you to follow my advice, this post is simply an attempt to openly share information that I genuinely hope will be useful to you. I really don't have an ulterior motive*.

The three blog posts are:

[Me, Simply Wall St and a $30,000 experiment](https://medium.com/stock-market-101/me-simply-wall-st-and-a-30-000-experiment-2911a5ba3798) - In which I discuss:

- Why investing over the medium to long term beats swing / day trading
- The importance of a healthy approach to investing (having an emergency fund disposable income, risk mgt)
- A little more about Simply Wall Street


[Diamonds in the Rough — Finding Good Investments](https://medium.com/stock-market-101/diamonds-in-the-rough-finding-good-investments-fceae318bc0e) - In which I discuss:

- The importance of having a good investing strategy
- The foundations of a good strategy
- My personal approach to investing (strong financial health, paying a dividend, good value, proven track record)


[Finding $30,000 of value in the stock market — Picking the right stocks](https://medium.com/stock-market-101/finding-30-000-of-value-in-the-stock-market-picking-the-right-stocks-78782dc289ec) - In which I discuss:

- How do you find deep value in the stock market?
- How I picked stocks to invest in
- The stocks that I picked and why I picked them
- Providing a publicly shared portfolio spreadsheet so that you can track my progress - You can [see the spreadsheet directly here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fgnXbnXB1k9nl249Z8QXmz0I2Zxzjkq7bIrPq4B2Qvc/edit#gid=0)

My hope is that through sharing all of this openly that I can demonstrate that a measured, objective, research-based approach to investing can help us build wealth.

While I know that ETFs, index funds and other instruments will still be preferable to the majority of investors, I hope that those of you investing in individual companies will find something worthwhile here.

TL;DR: I'm investing $30,000 of my own money into individual, deep-value stocks that I have researched and sharing what I am doing in the hope that it's useful to other people here.

I am very happy to answer any questions and take feedback.

15-04-02,"Tuff's Rules for Day Trading (Abridged Version)","Rule Number 1. Practice, Practice, Practice. Practice until you have your system down. Then practice your system for 3 months on a paper trade account before you use real money. 

Rule Number 2. NEVER trade more than 1/3 of your available money on one stock. This is especially true if you are using a cash account. Nothing sucks more than not having the funds to trade a sure thing.

Rule Number 3. PGFHGS Pigs get fat. Hogs get slaughtered. When your stock rises to your expectations, sell it. Don't sit on it thinking you can make more. Sell it and move on. Nothing sucks worse than having your money made, getting greedy, then watching it freefall past your selling point and you can't sell it.

Rule Number 4. NEVER EVER EVER trade OTCBB or Pink Sheets. This is a recipe for failure. You can respond to this if you want to but you'll be wrong. You know you're wrong.

Rule Number 5. Don't keep any positions open overnight. Close out every day.

Rule Number 6. NEVER trade without doing your research. Stick to your system and trade the right way.

Rule Number 7. Your first loss is your best loss. If your stock isn’t moving in any direction, don’t just sit on it hoping it’s going to go up. Chances are, if a stock price is static, it will go down before it goes up. Sell it and move on.

Rule Number 8. Look at volume as well as price. Only trade stocks with a minimum volume of 100,000. What good is a stock that you can’t unload?

Rule Number 9. Either be trading or be educating. Fine tune your game. Watch videos. Take advantage of the free tools given to you by most trading platforms. 

Rule Number 10. Be a leader, not a follower. By the time you hear about a “great stock” it’s already too late. Other traders are going to have a ball spending your money.

Rule Number 11. If you’re a gambler, you have no business trading stocks. Gamblers are emotional. Traders are emotionless. We are emotionless because we have data to back up our theories. Sometimes we win, and sometimes we lose but we are educated in what we do, not emotional.

Rule Number 12. Always set aside money to pay your taxes. This is how you’re gonna screw up if you’re not careful. Next thing you know, Aunt Iris is taking your trading money and you’re out of business.

I have more rules that I will post later. I don’t want to overwhelm you.

The purpose was to present data supporting the argument that the S&amp;P 500 is trading at a historically expensive level in a number of key valuation metrics.

There could have been a private investment newsletter or something that increased interest. 

 Will this be long-lasting? It is impossible to tell. If recent investors have gotten in for the long run, then maybe Anavex will keep trending up. However, the all-important phase 2a trial results are not scheduled for release until the 3rd quarter (July-September), so many of the new investors could get bored with Anavex and dump what they're buying today if the prices doesn't keep going up.

What do people think? I know there's more to be done, but wanted to know if anything resonates or maybe relates to something you have experience in. We (me and /u/zoziac) are currently debating between exploring:

* Tax-loss harvesting tool - an open-source simulator that'd parameterize the values robo-advisors currently presume. Has anyone worked on something like this, or interested in collaborating?
* Automated trade execution - probably as a desktop program that interfaces with an API-friendly brokerage like Interactive Brokers, but wouldn't know about other account holdings
* Portfolio analysis tools (read-only OFX access to all your financial accounts, but no automated execution) to help people understand what they may be doing wrong. Inspired by this [OpenFolio post](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3174w0/70_of_investors_are_making_basic_mistakes_which/) we thought a tool that runs community-created checks might be cool.

15-04-02,The water crisis has been getting more and more acute. How do we profit from this disruption?,"I met with a vice president at Hilliard Lyons recently and he confided to me that many in his profession consider water to be ""the next major collapse."" We've probably all seen the news stories about what's happening in California right now, to say nothing of the situation in places like Iran.

How do we insulate our portfolios against the disruption this will cause and possibly even make some great gains in the process? I am not a monster and am not trying to profit off of a global water shortage that is going to negatively affect millions of people, but I do think that companies doing things like sanitation, resource management, and infrastructure maintenance are going to see a lot of growth.

I will share a few leads that I've come up with in my limited research, but would love to hear from people with more experience and a better sense of what may lie ahead. A lot of what I've seen is focused in the US, so some more international perspectives would be great, too.

Long story short, there are a lot of ""sheep"" in this stock so if it was going to washout. I think there is a possibility it could bounce, but not a good one.

15-04-03,Drop in US oil production drives oil prices up sharply,"Oil prices made strong gains yesterday afternoon. At its peak, Brent increased by more than 4% to just shy of $58 per barrel, while WTI surged by more than 5% to $50.5 per barrel. 

The upswing was triggered by data from the US Department of Energy, which showed that US crude oil production had declined for the first time in eight weeks. Although US oil production also fell in some weeks during December and January, this was almost certainly due to shale oil production in North Dakota being hampered by cold winter weather. 

This is not something that can explain the current decrease in production. Indeed, it could well be an indication that the slump in drilling activity since the beginning of the year is now starting to be reflected in the hard production data. This would also tally with the latest statements by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), which anticipates a decline in oil production in three of the four major US shale oil formations in April. 

""The coming weeks will reveal whether the current fall actually marks a reversal in the US oil production trend. Oil prices shed some of their gains again overnight. This is because there is still a considerable oversupply, as also evidenced in further rising US oil stocks"", says Commerzbank. 

Last week saw US crude oil stocks increase for the twelfth consecutive time, crude oil stocks at Cushing even growing for the seventeenth week in a row.

15-04-03,[x-post from PF] The Only Five Funds You Need to Own: Some questions,"Hey all, I found an [article](http://www.kiplinger.com/article/investing/T030-C007-S001-5-vanguard-index-funds-you-need-to-own.html) on Kiplinger.  I wanted to get your take and ask a few questions.

Goldberg, the author, suggests assembling a portfolio with the following funds:

* 40% Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTSMX)

* 10% Vanguard Small-Cap Value (VISVX)

* 20% Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US (VFWIX)

* 5% Vanguard Emerging Markets (VEIEX)

* 25% Vanguard Intermediate Corporate Bond Admiral shares  (VICSX)

I completely get having VTMSX as a core, and I have a holding in VISVX.  What I'm confused about is:

1.  What's the advantage of having VFWIX and VEIEX over the Total International Stock Market?  Or is it really six of one, half dozen of the other? According to [Bogleheads](http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Compare_Vanguard_international_funds), the latter seems to be the clear choice due to its more diversified holdings.  The VFWIX and VEIEX seem to be overweighted in their Asian holdings according to morningstar.  Now, I understand that he might be bullish on Asia, but is that a position a lot of people are taking for the long run?

2. I know some feel that bonds are a questionable investment for a lot of people right now. I'm 28 and I've got a ways to go before I retire, that said, I do want to have a bond position in my portfolio for diversification purposes across asset classes.  I have positions in Vanguard's Total Bond Market, but Goldberg recommends VICSX.  His argument is that: 

&gt;The risk-adjusted returns of intermediate bonds (that is, returns relative to volatility) have historically been stronger than those of both long-term bonds and short-term bonds. I prefer a corporate bond ETF over a total bond market ETF because the latter holds too many Treasury bonds, which yield less than corporate IOUs. Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond tracks Barclays Capital U.S. 5-10 Year Corporate Bond Index, and the average credit rating of its holdings is triple-B. The fund returned an annualized 6.8% over the past five years, but with bond yields so low, don’t expect such generous returns to continue. Expenses are 0.12%.

However, given that interest rates may rise come June, will corporate bonds be more adversely affected than a Total Bond Fund?  Are there considerations I haven't taken into account here?",0

&gt; 
&gt; Chen Lin: I'm not a technician, but I looked at North American production increases of 1 million barrels a year and knew it would result in an oversupply situation, especially in light of the world economy softening. It was a perfect storm for the energy sector. The rapid increase in the fracking production in North America has been phenomenal, but it had to result in lower prices, so a year ago, I started planning on $47/bbl oil just to put a rough number there. At that price, fracking will be curbed, and then we can get back in balance again.

&gt; A year later, that is right about where we are. Looking ahead, I see oil bottoming in 2015. As the price drop occurs, a lot of companies will go under because they are not sustainable. ",5

15-04-04,Can I create a derivative?,"So my bother-in-law and i were talking after a visit to Puerto Rico and noticing how little roof-top solar there is.  We knew that the price of elctricity is high there $0.24-$0.29KWh.  And Puerto Rico has net-metering.  So let's assume that it makes sense for everyone to have solar, they just can't afford it.  

Let's say I started a business and installed $100k worth of solar power on residental roof-tops and contracted that they would by the solar from me at a 10% discount.  Could I take those contracts and turn them into a derivative myself and sell it to get the capital back?  I assume that I am over-simplifing things, and my question isn't if this is a good business idea, more along if it was done could I then get the capital back out through a derivative.

edit: I know companies do this already and it is not an original idea.  I want to know if a small time guy could do it with 100k or I would have to do it with multi-millions.",8
15-04-03,In Depth look at the last major US deleverging (1934-1956) - Or why interest rates will remain low for the next 20 years and its effect on stock prices,"TD;DR at the bottom

Below imgur link is a table showing various metrics for the economy and stock market for the period 1934-1956).  There's a lot here so I recommend reading the guide as you look at the table:

http://i.imgur.com/vTJ7zU3.png

Guide:

*First thing to look at is (IMO) the most important metric in the economy:  ****Total Credit to GDP ratio****.  You can see it goes from 235% in 1934 to 127% in the mid 1950's.  This metric drives interest rates, which in turn drives stock market valuations.

As long as the economy as a whole is deleverging, interest rates remain low because no one is willing to borrow..  You can see that once we were done delevering, and started to lever up in the late 1950s, that interest rates started to rise as well.

*The next metric i use is the 10 year E/Y, which is just the inverse of the shiller PE.  This basically says ""what is the coupon for the stock market as a whole""...next we compare this to the current 10 year yield.  Basically showing:  how does the expected yield of the stock market compare to the yield of treasuries.  If the stock market yield is lower than the treasury yield, the stock market is overvalued, and visa versa.   Simple, but imo more valuable than just looking at Shiller P/e etc.   You need shiller P/E that also accounts for interest rates

*Now this metric can't predict FUTURE interest rate changes.a stock market may look cheap now at 3% treasury yields, but if treasuries go to 20% tomorrow that changes the entire equation..  Risk free returns are 20% so the 3-5% stock market E/Y looks horrible...stock prices drop.  

*combining all this, we can use total credit to GDP to predict the future approx treasury yields, and then use to to arrive at what stock market E/Y should be at in the future.  We can say that as we continue to delever from 360% total credit to GDP (2009) to say something around 200% or lower in the late 2020's or 2030's, that 10 year yields will still be below 3% in 2030, and that in turn means the shiller P/E will likely be quite high around then (above 25)

*The final step in predicting stock market values is looking at what rate Earnings have grown at and what they are likely to grow at in the future.  over the past 50 years, earnings have grown about 6% a year.   Assuming shiller P/E remains unchanged over the next 20 years, the stock market should grow around 6% over the next 20 years...Stock market doesn't appear overvalued to me

**Tl;DR: US economy will continue to delever into the 2030s, which will keep treasury yields below 3% or so, which will keep Shiller P/E relatively high (above 25), which means stock market will likely grow 6%/year from these levels for the next 15-25 years...perfectly in line with 6% per year earnings growth.  Stock market not overvalued.**",26

15-04-04,INTC and QCOM — Internet of Things Stocks Worth Following,"The purpose of this report was to pick the best IoT stocks (from the 13 in the blue tables (http://aoiclub.com/?page_id=77) previously posted) that hold the best potential for future growth. I was looking for financially stable and efficient companies with good valued stock.

1. First I narrowed my search by selecting those companies with net profits near equal or higher than industries averages and ROEs greater than 15.  Eight made the cut.

CSCO
INTC
SAP
SWKS
ARMH
QCOM
RHT
PTC
2.  Next the search was narrowed to companies with a Debt to Capitol Ratio of Less than 80% industry average.  Four made the cut.

INTC
SWKS
ARMH
QCOM

3. Next, I looked for stocks with 5 year ESP greater than 15%-20%

INTC –  15.92
QCOM  –  26.85
SWKS   – 29.44
ARMH   31.66

4.  Then I eliminated stocks that don’t pay dividends; in this case, all do.

5. Next, I evaluated if the stock was at a good value by looking for stocks with a P/E TTM less than 10, a P/E 5 year of less than 20, a PEG TTM of less than 1 and a P/B MRQ of less than 1.5.

Because none of these 4 stocks meant these standards, I decided to determined the actual market values of the stock.

ESP TTM	ESP TTM industry average	P/E TMM industry average	Actual Market Value	Current Market Value
INTC	$2.32	$1.75	19.70	$45.70	$30.98
QCOM	$4.73	$1.87	25.64	$121.28	$67.92
SWKS	$2.90	$1.75	19.70	$57.13	$96.19
ARMH	$0.80	$1.75	19.70	$15.96	$49.11
Results show that INTC and QCOM are undervalued; and SWKS are ARMH are overvalued.

6.  Based on the above analysis, and at this time, I conclude that INTC and QCOM are potentially the best, out of the original 13 IoT stocks, to follow for future investment.",8

What's keeping me from opening a business and issuing CDs at a rate of .60%, invest said money in an Ally account and receive .99%, and pocket the remaining .39%? Perhaps the returns just imply that it's riskier to keep your money with Ally?

In the 2008-2009 ""cheap"" market, Dentsply traded at 1.9 times sales, 14.5 times earnings, and 9.6 times EBITDA.  In the ""expensive"" 1999-2000 market, Dentsply traded at 1.9 times sales, 14.8 times earnings, and 9.6 times EBITDA.

Today (as of 12/31/14), Dentsply trades at 2.7 times sales, 22.0 times earnings, and 15.0 times EBITDA. 

It is hard for me to see how anyone buying these kinds of businesses at today's prices could earn an adequate rate of return.

The ""expensive"" market of 1999-2000 was not much different for for this and many other ""blue chip"" companies than the ""cheap"" market of 2008-2009.  This is in contrast to today.

I'll admit I'm new to investing I just wanted to share one piece of investing strategy I'll be following over the next year. Virtualization is I believed poised to become even more important in the server market, with increasing media and public interest in cloud computing and security.

http://www.techopedia.com/2/30893/trends/the-future-of-virtualization-whats-new-for-2015

VMW is the stock I'm personally going into, they've got a good technology growth and they're focused on increasing the value of their products. Also as someone familiar with tech, when you think virtualization you think VMware-- I'm thinking it's not a trick question and go with my gut. http://www.serverwatch.com/server-trends/vmware-sets-the-stage-for-server-virtualization-in-2015.html

ORCL would be my second choice I'm just not that liquid to be investing in both at this time. I'd like to bet on ORCL because I've heard it's pursuing a sort of ""lack of oxygen"" competition with its competitors, freezing them out of markets it wants to compete in because it's so integral in many tech applications it has that type of power. And the CEO is a big enough dick I feel they'll execute that strategy well. http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2013/09/24/playing-hooky-billionaire-larry-ellison-skips-oracle-conference-for-americas-cup-sailing/

The Chinese Market has been doing really well over the last year: http://qz.com/376388/the-chinese-stock-market-gold-rush-continued-this-week/

I am willing to bet the market will correct itself soon, and therefore would like to short the Chinese Market. I am a relatively new investor and don't want to micromanage stocks. I would like to simply buy an ETF that tracks negatively with the Chinese Market. What are my options?

Is ProShares reliable? Something like: [YXI](https://www.google.com/finance?q=YXI)

Is it in general a good idea to buy an ETF that shorts a given market, or is it better to short in some other fashion?",10

Should i just put my money into S&amp;P 500 and Vanguard? I've heard the two of these funds get mentioned and they seem rather safe. I already have an IRA set up and accruing 20% of my pay each month, the money i have in my savings right now is money that i want to try to invest for the relatively short term.

Meanwhile, does anyone have any advice on how you find leads or have an idea of what company has a lot of potential?

Ten years ago, I was in High school, but it wouldn't have surprised me whatsoever to learn this.

15-04-05,"Something weird is going on with Zillow's stock. Can you guys help me understand this.","So, Zillow (a a marketplace that provides real estate, home related information online) is a leader in this category. Their stock is doing well, its trading at about 100 dollars, but the problem is I think its way over valued, and even saying way overvalued I think its quite an understatement. Let me make my case. 

In the year 2012, pre income tax, they reported a loss of about 5 million, in the 2013 they reported a loss about 16 million, and in 2014, they reported losses of about 43 million!. What do you guys think about this trend? shouldn't this trend be concerning. Of course, Zillow could defend itself by saying that they spent a whopping 167 million on sales and marketing last year to build brand awareness and they could reduce those costs this year and they might be even be profitable (something they have not been in a long time). But, it is my belief that if you have to reduce marketing costs to even break even or make a profit and not through increased revenues then something is really wrong. That brings me to my next point. Is their business model sustainable? Could they ever squeeze a profit with their business model right now?

For those of y'all who are not sure about their business model, Zillow is not a real estate brokerage (whose customers are consumers who buy and sell homes), they are a advertising company and their customers for the most part are real estate agents who buy ads on their site. This is how they make money, they have this thing called the 'Zillow Premier agent program"" where they sell ads to a certain number of real estate agents one zip code, and in return these agents spend several hundred dollars. This is Zillow's bread and butter. But, this is the thing, right now about 60,000 agents (out of 1 million agents) spend money on Zillow ads, and many believe they have maxed out. You are not going to get much more than that (maybe 100,000 max) and even then its going to be very hard for them to get these agents to constitently spend money on ads. It is an open secret that in the real estate industry that the top 20 percent of agents in the country make 80 percent of the commissions. So, a whole lot of them are not making any money at all, and some are barely making money, so how in the world can they afford to buy zillow ads, which is expensive. So, you could make an argument that their business model is kinda flawed, you already have the agents who could buy ads on your platform already spending money, and that might be it. 

I strongly feel that they are not able to get a lot more agents to sign up, and thus to make money they are raising the current cost of ads for the agents signed up, and they are not pleased. They are in a tricky situation, if they raise the prices too much the agents will not sign up, the agents already signed up might refuse to spend any more money and leave, and if they dont raise the prices they might not be able to ever turn a profit. So, what do you guys think? I dont see a sustainable business model. 

Add to the fact, that you constantly see top level executives at Zillow selling stock, its just gives me a weird feeling. Why sell it? do they feel that the price right now is overvalued too and inevitabily come down? What am i missing? When I think the stock price should be at an all time low, it is doing better than ever before. Really appreciate you guys' help!

*UPDATE*

This was published this morning, turns out I am not the only one who was kinda suspicious about Zillow.

15-04-06,A ‘Sneak Peek’ Inside Two Subscribers-Only Portfolios,"There’s an old investment saying that you should buy what you know. If we did that, it surely would limit the number of companies in which we invest. Maybe that wouldn’t be such a bad thing, but perhaps a better strategy would be to buy things you understand. That would open the gates to a number of companies, particularly if you understand the tailwinds that may be driving the business.

A case in point occurred last week when Twitter (TWTR) took the wraps off Periscope, its new live streaming service that looks to do for video what “selfies” did for camera shots. We’ve seen the steady progression toward mobile video streaming that now goes above and beyond streaming video from Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) or Hulu on a smartphone or tablet. Twitter’s Vine and even Facebook’s (FB) streaming videos on its own service or on Instagram have paved the way for Periscope and other soon-to-be-released products.

But Friday's strong sales figures sent shares up 8% in Monday trading, wiping out about half of this year's sell-off in a single day.
The company said last week it sold 10,300 of the Model S, which starts at around $70,000, in the first three months of the year, up 55% from the same period of last year. That was about 500 cars more than expected.
The worries about China had caused some people to think Tesla would miss sales targets, said Rod Lache, auto analyst for Deutsche Bank.
""It's good to see the company exceed targets,"" Lache said. ""But in the long run this should not be why anybody is buying the stock at this point. You should be buying because you believe the company will be a much larger business in the future.""

What is basis swap?

Basis swap is an arrangement where two parties exchange variable interest rates from two different money market benchmark, like one might pay Libor where other might choose Treasury bill +spread.

This given example is cross currency basis swap. Where one payment leg is Euro another is USD. Banks are the major participants in this arrangement.
Negative EUR USD basis swap means Euro zone banks are paying premium to access dollar funding. Extreme values might suggest stresses and funding crisis.

This swap traded close to -70 basis points during 2008/09 as financial crisis of that time gave rise to liquidity crunch and banks run for liquidity have dollar pushed the basis spread to that level.
 
During 2011/12, at peak of the Euro zone crisis, US money market funds withdrew their exposure to the region that gave rise to massive dollar funding lack, pushing the spread lower to around -80 basis points.
Since 2014, basis spread after reaching to zero, once again started dropping, now close to -30 basis points. Question is why? Is it an indication to renewed funding stress?

Stress may not be the reason this time. US regulators penalties over banks has given to some dollar funding need, however that doesn't seem large enough to push the spread to the extent.
Euro zone banks and investment house is reaching out to better yielding dollar assets is the major reason for this latest push.
Dollar will remain well bid, especially against Euro, Yen as yield spread is  still significant. However, without improving yield that has fallen over weaker NFP and dovish FED Dollar will lack the driving force.

15-04-07,Tactics for First-Time Buyers,"It was less than a year ago that Mrs Scot and I first jumped on the property ladder. While many finance bloggers preach that renting a house is far superior to buying  – After 11 months of home-ownership I can honestly say that it was the best decision ever! While technically speaking, we don’t fully own the house (the bank does for the next couple of decades) – it is an amazing feeling being able to paint, drill holes and carry-out renovations without seeking permission. Better still, there is no landlord or agency that can turn up for an inspection with 24 hours notice!
If you’re looking at buying a home and want to get your foot on the first rung of the property ladder, you’ve probably already begun viewing properties, investigating mortgage interest rates and maybe even thought about making an offer. At this point, it is important to ensure that you have considered three key things before even looking to buy: Long-Term Plan, Affordability and Exit Plan. Assuming that you have, here are three tips to help you with the next step of the process:
 
Finding a Property
Simply browsing estate agents’ windows may not find you that dream home; you have to put the effort in. This may involve widening your search and investigating your options online. Consider property comparison sites - and use many of them. Just because the ‘big’ ones don’t list a house, it doesn’t mean that it is not worth considering. While it is advantageous to have your house listed in the main directories when selling, not everyone knows about them – and not all estate agents use the comparison sites. Search the online databases of local estate agents and don’t forget about local newspapers. Consider auctions and foreclosures – more often than not, the hidden gems are the ones that you have to do a bit of looking to find!
Don’t just limit yourself to one specific area either. You may have your ideal location, but it may be worthwhile also considering alternative options at this stage. Work out a ‘zone’ where you would be prepared to commute to work from – investigate public transport links, local schools, shops, services etc. Don’t make the mistake that we did and buy a house that is one street away from a fiber-optic broadband connection!
 Tactics for First-Time Buyers
Putting in an Offer
Once you’ve found a property that’s suitable for your needs, the next step is to put in an offer. Obviously you’ll be aware of the asking price, but always try and leave some room for negotiation when putting forward an initial offer – this will leave you with the possibility of reaching some middle ground with the vendor. Most people don’t know what is the ‘expected’ discount on an offer – the truth of the matter is that there is no standard and you can negotiate until your heart’s content! We put in an offer £10,000 under the asking price (which had already been dropped £7,500). We reached middle ground and saved an additional £4000; with a bunch of appliances and furniture included – (fridge, dishwasher, bookcases, sideboard cupboards).
This is the stage when you can start to think a little tactically. Always be mindful of the circumstances of the seller as this can often create some room for manoeuvre on the price. Often sellers may need to make a quick sale and as a first-time buyer this places you in an extremely advantageous position. As you’re not involved in a chain the sale can go through quickly. Remember this and use it to your advantage when making an offer. A lower price on a quick sale may well be more attractive to the vendor.
It’s also worth bearing in mind that if you are buying property in Scotland, there is a slightly different process to follow when putting in an offer.
Another point to bear in mind is that you will often have to prove your ability to qualify for a mortgage. Pre-approvals can be obtained with a given validity and are an excellent thing to have in advance of making an offer. It will also make you a more favorable party if there are multiple offers on the table.
 
See it through
This may not be a specific tactic, but it’s still worthwhile advice. Once your offer is accepted, it really pays to be conscientious and see everything through. It’s imperative that you complete everything on time because even though your offer has been accepted you can still be ‘gazumped’. You can’t necessarily stop this happening, but by ensuring you keep up to date with your side of things, you can place yourself in the best position to avoid this. Furthermore, at this stage you have likely already occurred legal fees – being sloppy and not acting quickly can cost you a bit of cash!

15-04-07,My pitch for Medovex ($MDVX),"Medovex's IPO opened in December of 2014, and has since been under the radar seeing as they haven't yet commercialized their main product [DenerveX](http://medovex.com/denervex-2/). 

Just this month however, Medovex [completed successful Phase III testing](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/medovex-corporations-denervextm-device-passes-significant-development-milestone-2015-04-02) and are moving onto Phase IV. Medovex also recently [acquired Streamline](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/medovex-corp-closes-acquisition-of-streamline-inc-2015-03-26), a medical technology company. 

But a company's future doesn't just come from its patents. Medovex's [board of directors](http://ir.medovex.com/board-of-directors) is filled with high level managers of some very successful companies. Now whether this means Medovex will succeed isn't my place to say, but an experienced and wealthy Board doesn't make for a bad outlook. 

In my opinion, a company with such successful backing and a potential consumer base of millions^1 doesn't just stop at one product. After their acquisition of Streamline, I think Medovex is positioning themselves to develop a large pipeline of products and drugs, and potentially become a giant in the medical industry. 

*1. ""In 2011, Medicare and Medicaid patients alone accounted for approximately 1.8 million injections and RF Rhizotomyablations""*

And in all honesty, I have invested in Medovex myself (the company issue warrants, $MDVXW, which expire December 2017). So take my argument with that into account! ",3

15-04-07,This Subreddit Should Be More Open To Opinions,"What I have noticed
-

 In the past couple of days I have been in other ""trading"" subreddits and they all seem to be open to opinions. The people on those subreddits are very open minded and are not limiting themselves to one style of trading. For some reason this subreddit hasn't been open to opinions. Any post that's an opinion gets downvoted into oblivion and never gets a solid chance. The only posts on the top of the front page are posts like ""What do you guys think of X stock"". 

In other trading subreddits (investing, stockmarket, pennystocks, etc) they are not downvoting posts just because they dislike the person or because they disagree. They only downvote when a post is ""spam"". 

So my point is, I think it would make this subreddit a lot better if people weren't so quick to downvote posts. If someone gives you advice (Even if it is bad advice), just be happy you are getting advice. Because when you think about it, 99%+ of traders DO NOT get advice from anyone.

To quote enzomatic75:

* **So I keep my status low key and try to contribute to this sub but I find that it's a huge karma suck because this sub is quite literally a circle jerk of hacks that have little idea of what they are talking about. I have posted great tips that have been generous to me, downvoted in to invisibility. I have given great advice to idiots wondering which marijuana PINK sheet to invest in and given them sound advice, like NO!**

(keep in mind he posted this A YEAR AGO and the same thing is still happening)

-

This subreddit needs to be more open, posts about what people are actually trading vs what stock picks they want. Plus, the highest quality posts are the ones that are the most downvoted. Why? Because they say something truthful and try to help the OP in the long run. I know you might be saying ""well thats just how traders are""; not true. This is the only subreddit that I have encountered that does this. 

This subreddit needs more ""I am going to trade x stock tomorrow and here is why"" kind of posts and less ""x is good, what am I missing"" kind of posts.

&gt;A. Go back to central banks. Central banks look at growth, at employment, at wages. They are too low. They don’t have the instruments they need, but they feel obliged to do something. So they artificially lift asset prices by maintaining zero interest rates and by using their balance sheet to buy assets.

&gt;Why? Because they hope that they will trigger what’s called the wealth effect. That you will open your 401k, see it has gone up in price, and you’ll spend. And that companies will see their shares are going up and they will be more willing to invest. But there is a massive gap right now between asset prices and fundamentals.

15-04-06,Advice on building an ETF portfolio for long term,"Hi all,

Looking for some advice /input on building a long term ETF portfolio. My current holdings are admittedly a mess, thought I'd have more time to monitor / adjust but haven't stuck to it and it's just become ... messy.

I'm currently 28 from Europe but currently living in Asia and have been for the last 5 years.

Currently I have the following (I'll be quoting all in USD equivalent to make it simpler)

Hargreaves SIPP in UK - Split between 3 funds (Artemis European Growth, Henderson Emerging Markets, Neptune Global Equity) - approx $50K

TD Ameritrade - Main holdings for long term BND, GLD, IVV, VBK, VGK, VNQ, VOT, VUG, VWO, WIP - approx $35k. Another $20k in riskier short term holdings (RSX, THD, IDX), $6K cash.

Interactive Brokers - Long term VUSD, VUKE, VMID, VERX, VFEM, VAPX, VEUR (LSE listed Vanguard ETFs) - approx $55k, $55k cash.

The SIPP in UK can't be withdrawn or topped up any longer, but I can switch to other funds that are available under their platform.

Reason for opening TDAM was the fact they support DRIPS which IB doesn't, however where I'm tax resident doesn't have a tax agreement with the US so I suffer 30% withholding taxes on US domiciled ETFs - hence why I moved on to LSE listed Vanguard ETFs (through IB)

So basically I'm looking to clean things up, and hold far less ETFs than I am now - maybe 4 or so at most in each account (8 in total) to keep things simple, and re-balance once every 1/3/6 months, rather than having it as out of control as it is now.

Appreciate any input :)

15-04-06,"Saudi Arabia raises price, is demand improving?","Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, raised pricing for all May sales to Asia. Country's oil minister said that global demand is improving.

State-owned Saudi ArabianOilCo. narrowed the discount for its Arab Light grade to Asia by $0.30/barrel setting the crude at a discount of $0.60/barrel to the regional benchmark.
Does it indicate demand is coming back?

Probably not.

The producer cut pricing for May sales of Light crude to the U.S. by $0.10/barrel and to Northwest Europe by $0.20/barrel, according to the statement. This sure is not a positive indication for global demand. Europe stands one of the largest crude consuming region in world.
Can it then be said demand is improving in Asia?

Consumption demand might not be improving as a whole. Part of the demand is coming from countries and companies building up coffers amid weaker price. China is reported to be building up strategic reserve worth 90 days of supply.

Refineries are the driver of demand. Indian sub-continent is set to become world's largest crude oil refining region.
Is there supply crunch then?

Supply still remains at large.

Refineries across regions are choosing between producers.
South Korea taking deliveries of oil from Mexico, first time in years.
Iranian tankers stand ready offshore ready to be delivered.
Eassar oil reported to be taking deliveries from Latin America.
Why raise price then?

If noted carefully, Saudis' have been raising price of light crude that is in high demand across refineries. To note Saudi Arabia has also been reducing its export of heavy crude, which now is being used in domestic market.

Index and mutual funds

How to start investing

Investing, what is the point?

Top 4 Authorities in the Financial World

Risk and reward are NOT related

Stock picking: buy the leaders

 

For short term investors and traders, it’s crucial to recognize the short term market peak when it happens.  I’ve already discussed the characteristics of long term, multi-year bull market peaks. This time we’re looking at short term peaks (that are not new all time highs) and their characteristics to help you maximize returns on your private investments.

 

Define a Short Term Market Peak

Before we identify the common characteristics of a short term market peak, we must first define this term. Here’s an example – GDX, the gold miner’s ETF:

 Multiple Resistance
Multiple Resistance
No New All Time High

As you can see from the chart above, this type of short term market peak is not near an all-time high. Rather, the market has fallen for a while, and this is the short term market peak during one of the waves in a subsequent uptrend.

Time Frame

The “wave” lasts just a few months – anything longer than 4 months, and this is not considered to be a “short term” market peak.

The Above Example

As you can see the chart for GDX (gold miners ETF) above, GDX has fallen for almost a year now (which coincides with the decline in gold and silver). Only recently has GDX moved off of its lows. This fits in perfectly with the “short term” market peak concept. GDX is nowhere near an all time high (in fact, it GDX just hit bottom), and this recent wave has only lasted over a month.

Identify the Peak

When you make short term investment decisions, you absolutely have to use technical analysis. However, the problem is that there are many technical indicators. In the event that these indicators are sending mixed signals, which one should you use? Which one is more important and can override the others? I honestly don’t know.

HOWEVER, I do know that when all the technical indicators align and point towards one direction, the probably of that happening greatly increases. If all my technical indicators send out a clear SELL signal, then the odds of the market falling is very likely.

Regarding short term market peaks, 4 things will send a clear SELL signal when they all happen at the same time:

Major resistance.
Heavy volume.
Intraday bloodbath.
Connections between markets.
Major Resistance

Markets will often peak at a price that was a massive historical resistance point. If you look at the GDX chart below, you’d notice that GDX failed to break through this resistance barrier multiple times in the past 6 months. Thus, the fact that GDX is right below this resistance level today means that it will likely fail to break this resistance (again). This sends a major warning sign that the short term peak is in.

 Multiple resistances, + the recent massive red bar
Multiple resistances, + the recent massive red bar
Heavy Volume

A lot of traders like to look at volume – I don’t really know why. They believe that volume sends a lot of clear signs – personally, I can’t seem to make volume work to my advantage.

However, volume is really useful when the market faces a major resistance and promptly falls. Such a decline in market price combined with heavy selling means that the market is very weak. Thus, a clear warning sign that the market might peak is sent.

Massive Red Intraday Bar

If the market falls really hard one day without any meaningful support, it will create a massive red intraday bar. This means that the market is really, really weak because there is virtually no support. Coupled with heavy volume, this sends a clear sign that the bears vastly overpower the bulls.

Connections Between Markets

I don’t just look at one market – I look at 8 markets. I look at multiple U.S. stock indexes (Russell, S&amp;P500, NASDAQ), multiple commodity markets (gold, silver, copper, oil), and currencies (primarily the EURO/USD pair). Why?

Because markets are highly correlated nowadays, what happens in one market will affect other markets. For example, I recently believe that the short term peak for stocks is in. Thus, stock prices will fall. When stock prices will fall, it will likely drag down gold and GDX (gold miners) prices with them.

Summary

When the following three things happen at the same time, it is very, very likely that the short term market peak is in:

A massive red intraday bar.
Heavy volume – this is the only time when volume is useful.
A massive resistance line that has stopped the market on multiple occasions.
Other markets are falling, dragging down this market with it.",1

15-04-07,The Stock Market definition and how to make money on the stock market,"The Stock Market definition , according to investopedia, ""The market in which shares of publicly held companies are issued and traded either through exchanges or over-the-counter markets. Also known as the equity market, the stock market is one of the most vital components of a free-market economy, as it provides companies with access to capital in exchange for giving investors a slice of ownership in the company. The stock market makes it possible to grow small initial sums of money into large ones, and to become wealthy without taking the risk of starting a business or making the sacrifices that often accompany a high-paying career.""

But the real staright up explanation is: ENJOYING THE FRUIT OF THE COMPANY'S LABOUR.
Its as simple as that. When the companies you've bought their shares are profiting, you make money through the dividends the companies pay out and by selling appreciated stocks at a profit called a capital gain,but the downside is that you can lose money if the companies whose stocks you hold lose money, the stocks' prices goes down and then you will be selling the stocks at loss.
Just like in the business of buying and selling of goods and comodities, where we buy from a manufacturers and sell at added gain to the wholesalers, who in turn sell at another added gain to the retailer, So does the Stock Market; We have the primary market and the secondary market. The primary market (manufacturers) is where new issues are first sold through initial public offerings. Institutional investors(you) typically purchase most of these shares from investment banks. All subsequent trading goes on in the secondary market where participants include both institutional and individual investors.
Stocks are traded through exchanges...Just like in the buying and selling business.

Post Oak Increases Minerco's LOC to $3 Million
HOUSTON, April 6, 2015 -- Minerco Resources is pleased to announce that it has signed an amendment with Post Oak, LLC. to increase its Line of Credit (LOC) with Post Oak from $2 million to $3 million. The increased availability of capital is part of Minerco’s growth strategy of creating significant equity value for its shareholders in the weeks and months to come. Put simply, Minerco has earmarked a portion of the additional credit line to continue to make acquisitions of cash-flowing assets. By strategically adding assets and/or vertically integrating key vendor services, Minerco intends to create internal profit centers, preserve margins, and add to the company’s overall equity value. The acquisition of said new assets is currently being considered for the Summer of 2015.
 
Spring Promotions For VitaminFIZZ®
VitaminFIZZ has been the life of the party this spring. Minerco’s subsidiary, Level 5 Beverage Company, has been spreading the word and bringing samples of its flagship line of sparkling functional waters to people all around the country. Last month, VitaminFIZZ went to Spring Break as StudentCity's beverage sponsor in Panama City Beach, Florida. StudentCity is a premier Spring Break vacation organizer in Panama City and other top destinations, worldwide. The promotion included product sampling, signage, brand ambassadors, swag giveaways, daily contests.
StudentCity also promoted the VitaminFIZZ brand in email marketing and on social media, to ALL of StudentCity's clients around the United States. Targeted follow-up will also be utilized for Spring Breakers from the Southwest, the Northeast, Texas and Florida.
VitaminFIZZ also made an appearance on the red carpet of an exclusive Maxim Magazine party at the Mid America Trucking Show in March. Maxim Magazine offered guests a healthful dose of refreshment as part of their gift bag. The event promoters invited Level 5 Beverage to participate after noticing that VitaminFIZZ was such a huge hit with guests at a previous Maxim party in San Francisco. VitaminFIZZ is currently available in a few select locations in the Lexington, KY area. Visit our online store locator for more information.
During March, VitaminFIZZ was part of the Albertson's Universal Studios Spring Break promotion. This highlighted the “Despicable Me” attraction and featured VitaminFIZZ at checkout stands and in printed circular ads. VitaminFIZZ supported the premium placements with continued sampling, radio and bill board advertising, as well as radio spots on the “Ryan Seacreast Show.”

15-04-07,"Q€: How can the ECB ever unwind it's bond purchases?","How can the European Central Bank ever unwind it's bond trades, let alone make a profit?

My understanding of what the ECB is doing is purchasing sovereign debt with it's unlimited supply of Euros. This abnormal market force puts a higher premium on the bond and pushes the bond yield lower. Many of these bonds currently have a negative yield of -.2% and is expected to go lower.

First of all, the ECB can't even find sellers of the bonds yet to fulfill their dream of purchasing 60 billion worth a month. They fell short in March with only 48 billion. They will have to continue raising their bids until sellers are enticed enough to fill the ECB's trade, which means the bonds will have even lower yields.

While the ECB holds these bonds, which they have bought at a high premium (likely a loss, as they become the majority of European liquidity), they will also have to pay the coupon because the yield is negative! Continuing to replace bonds with newly created money, expanding the monetary supply and decreasing the value of one euro (the exchange rate).

Economic powerhouses like Germany already have achieved a surplus and have no need to issue more bonds in an attempt to fund themselves, although this may be a red herring to anything.

I feel like this entire charade is a bet on export businesses attracting global trade, which is difficult to fathom.

I am having a hard time predicting possibilities here, after 18 months of purchases will the ECB just trickle down monetary expansion in the form of coupon payments on negative yields, and then in 10 years the countries just pay back the principal?

What is the current money supply of the Euro, and how will an additional 60 billion euros a month distort that?

Is there an economics forum where these things are more often discussed? I don't want to read ZeroHedge",8

**I don't claim to be a investing genius** 

But this is 100% honest.

My 3-4 mo is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2ndii4/my_magic_formula_portfolio/

IRA: For my IRA i decided to pick higher caps/ more well known companies. So far I'm beating the S&amp;P 500 by 5-7%.

AGX -5.2% (9/8)

BKE +1.6% (9/8)

BRCD +14.39% (9/8)

CSCO +8.6% (9/8)

HRB -2.7% (9/8)

K +0.3% (9/8)

RTN +9.9% (9/8)

TTWO +10.5% (10/3)

In the last 3 months nothings really changed. Rocky market.

For my personal: I decided to go a little crazier with lower caps/ more unknown companies (With the exception of AAPL).

AAPL +26.3% (9/5)

ADMS (Sold at +15.6%) (9/9) 

COH +19.4% (11/19)

GME -13.3% (11/19)

KING -1.3% (11/25)

LFVN -44.7% (11/25)

LQDT -22.9% (10/27)

NSR -2.7% (11/4)

PDLI -7.8% (1/14/15)

PETS +19.5% (11/25)

TNH -2.0% (2/26/15)

PTIE (Sold at - 49.7%) (9/9)

TZOO -5.9% (10/27)

I am currently losing money (down 7% according to etrade not including dividends or realized gains, in reality i'm probably down 2-5%, Still losing to S&amp;P 500 by 10%)

So, I sold PTIE and ADMS. I bought LFVN, which tanked. I will continue to hold and buy throughout the year.

**If I had any advice to give it would be: buy only market cap 3 billion or higher.**

15-04-07,"If I have a TSP, isn't it a better idea to roll my laid-off wife's 401k into a Sharebuilder IRA account with a $200 bonus rather than Vanguard?","Vanguard gets some serious love on this subreddit and for good reason, it seems. But I believe my wife's situation calls for going to Sharebuilder instead of Vanguard. Would love your input.

She was laid off from a private company and she's asked me where to roll over her 401k. She is 32 years old and has about $45,000 invested in her current 401k.

I am a 30-year old government employee participating in the TSP program and have about $27,000 invested. I currently contribute 5%/paycheck to get the government agency matching of 5% (sweet!).  

Going forward, the plan is to take advantage of my TSP plan, and instead of investing in her 401k or IRA, to instead invest it in mine. Perhaps up my contribution to 10 percent or so, if we are able to despite the loss of her income right now. 

So here's my question:  Doesn't it make more sense to roll her 401k into a Sharebuilder IRA account that currently offers a $200 bonus? She could then put everything in one trade in the Vanguard 2045 retirement mutual fund VTIVX which is currently featuring a 0.18 expense ratio on Sharebuilder (the same as on Vanguard's own site). There is no annual fee for a Sharebuilder IRA, so the total expense would be just buying the fund.

Doing the math, it would be $45000 + $200 (bonus) = $45200. Then minus the $20 mutual fund purchase fee, to equal $45180. Because the expense ratio is the same, the return on investment should be the same too. In addition, since we are adding to my TSP, and not Sharebuilder, we would not suffer additional trading fees. Therefore, the Sharebuilder option gives us an extra $180 that Vanguard doesn't at no cost.

What do you think?

**TL:DR:  Sharebuilder offers a $200 bonus for new IRA accounts. The expense ratio for the Vanguard retirement fund is the same as on Vanguard brokerage site. Should we move my wife's 401k there and then just use my TSP as her primary investment account to avoid reoccuring investment fees?**",1

15-04-07,Theoretical Stock Market Investment Plan,"Hello, I am a 19 year old college student who is preparing for summer break and looking forward to working a job again.  Instead of making money and going off and buying things like computer parts and video games (like I did last summer) I would like to invest in stocks.  I do have some experience with the stock market on etrade where I currently have 2 shares of Target, 4 of Ford, and 1 of Microsoft (all purchased in 2012).  I am estimating that I will make upwards of $2000 between June-August.  This is my theoretical plan for using the money I earn.  If I were to do this today, would I see a potential return? Or am I just wasting my time with investing in more stocks?  I would love any feedback and/or advice if anyone wants to help me out! 

Here is my current thought-process:

-Take $1000 of the $2000 and deposit it into savings in the bank

-Use the remaining $1000 to buy stocks through etrade 

-I am thinking of buying 10 shares of Sony, 4 shares of Apple, and an additional 2 shares of Target which will come out to roughly $970 including the $9.99 etrade transaction fee (if I were to buy them tomorrow)",6

1. Google - have played in the social space before, and have the analytic capabilities to mine the twitterverse for useful data to sell B2B?

2. Facebook - have acquired big companies before, are the number one leader in social and want to remain there.

3. IBM - already have shown their love for Twitter with some partnerships.  Have the Data capabilities to do some cool stuff with twitter data

4. Microsoft/Apple - Two long shots here. Both have a ton of cash but acquiring twitter would be a brand new space for both of them.

THCZ - Yeah, I know. We hear about it a lot lately on here. I originally bought in at .09, sold last week at .28, and was going to buy back in at .05 but it never got that low. I'm watching to see if it dips down below .10 again, but I'm not sure it will. I eventually see this stock getting off the OTC and onto a legit exchange.

WSTI - I have limited funds to play with, so I haven't hopped on this. But it's been growing steadily for a while. Could be a pump/dump. Not sure.

STSC - Woof. I don't know where the rise came from, but this blew up today. I was busy with other things and couldn't get in on it. Really missed out. I'm going to keep watching to see if I can find out why it hopped so much.

ALGA - I hopped on this at .05, and I think it's my first big mistake trade. I was hoping for a quick in and out, and now it looks like if I don't lose big, I'll be lucky to get out what I put in. I'm not sure what I was thinking; this is a lesson not to buy when I have a busy day and can't research as much as I want.

HERO - This one's tied to oil prices. Oil goes up - HERO will go up. That's my thinking, anyway.

15-04-07,Time is a valuable thing. Watch it fly by....,"I apologize if this has been asked before but I did a quick search and could not find anything similar. 

Like many on here I'm new to investing.

I simply want to get an idea on if I should spend time investing.

I realize that like many forms of mastery it takes at least 10k hours to really be considered a professional at a given topic and simply put I don't have that kind of time in investing. I've read Malcom Gladwell Outliers and it's given me an appreciation on what amount of time could realistically be spent on learning investing before you get good.

I currently have briefly read the side bar and still don't quite understand what the best course of action to take would be.

Firstly, I'm 25 and I have about 25k saved in the bank just sitting there. My problem is that I don't know a damn thing about investing and how I should use that 25k AND if it's even worth spending the time reading all these books and learning all of this stuff when I could alternatively make more money through something like a normal day job. Is it worth it to spend any time learning how to invest and investing?

15-04-08,Thoughts on VNM?,"Just wondering if anybody wanted to share thoughts on VNM ETF? Overall the attitude in the press towards the ETF and Vietnam's market in general seems to be quite positive, but it's taken double digit losses since the start of 2015 (when I got in). It's been on an overall downward trend for quite awhile, with some analysts predicting that would turn around in 2015.

I'm nodding my head at all the things I'm reading (affirming a bullish outlook), but I'm wondering if somebody more experienced could provide some insight. Demographics look great, and China's relative contraction in manufacturing presents an opportunity here. I work close with manufacturing, and I know first hand wage increases in China are driving work elsewhere, and Vietnam is a prime choice. Having spent some time there for work recently, it looks great to me - lots of infrastructure development happening, mostly from foreign investment. Very anecdotal, I know, but encouraging nonetheless. I think the big wildcard is how the gov't will change regulations related to foreign investments. Most seem to be saying it's headed in the right direction, but change seems to be slow.

Any counter opinion to this? I invested a decent chunk and have lost double digits, but my original plan was to be in for the long term. My current plan is to basically double down and put more money in to it, but I wanted to check if I may be missing something.

This was the only article I could find on it recently - seems to point to currency issues and the hit oil has taken recently as some reasons the downward trend has continued.

They've also invested over $34 billion over the past 5 years growing their manufacturing capacity. For me, a downside is that it's company based in Taiwan.

15-04-08,i too have written an algo. and finally beaten the SP in backtests. and i will talk about it. at least in general.,"EDIT:  Ok i deleted the text of my ""discovery"" because as was becoming obvious.   It was naive and stupid.

It's funny how much you think you know, when you dont know anything.
I learned a little bit about backtesting models just from the comments in this thread.

A reason why my results are invalid is because i was using  in-sample data and custom fitting my model to the data.
its interesting because i thought it would be obvious but some of it wasn't entirely. 

heres some notes/thoughts

1) i was keeping track of an array key offset +1 .. but i had it as 2.   That alone gave compounded and gave me an incredible illusion of success

2) then i thought about other things that i was using as ""constants"" .  my program allocated percentage of account value for certain actions.   then i realized...   im starting every test at 100,000k.   what if i start it at 90 or 110.  yeah that affected it too.

3) now im starting to be paranoid and question EVERYTHING... why did i choose to use this time frame or that time frame?  why did i choose to only check the last 10 days why not 11?  sure at some point you gotta draw a line in the sand but every part of the model needs to be held up and make sense.

4)  its funny, these little things affected it more than the securities i used, those i could interchange and my results stayed nice.  so maybe that part of the model is ok.

anyway the more i realize how many naive little things i did, the more i can appreciate why some people here eyeroll everytime someone announces they cracked the code.

15-04-08,good hedging strategy for those unsure,"There are a lot of folks on the sidelines , seeing the huge market rally since 2009 and wanting to get in, but worried about the market falling, having gone up so much.


Here's a way around this indecision. You simply put 33.3% of your cash in a 3x leveraged index etf (SPXL,RETL,TQQQ,UDOW) and the rest in cash or a 5-year T bond. Rebalance it yearly. You get pretty much all of the upside of the underlying index (or even more depending on compounding effects)

Let's look at 2011, the last time market fell hard. Assuming you have a $30k account and bought $10,000 TQQQ before the crash and put the other 20k in cash, when the SPY fell 18%, TQQQ fell 40% (based on the chart), you would have lost $4000 from your initial $30000 account, a loss of 15% vs. 18% for being all-in. Even if the market fell to zero you would never lose more than your $10k (33%).

IF you want to limit your losses even more, buy a deep in the money call option on one of these 3x etfs. That will cut your cost by 50%, so you would only lose maximum 15% instead of 33% ",0

* Today's policy decision was not unanimous but was kept unchanged over 8-1 votes. 

* Member Mr. Kiuchi once again voted against. His proposal was to reduction in purchase so that base rises at ¥45 trillion per annum.

* BOJ notes steady pace of private consumption that has been boosting GDP growth, while household sector in Japan remain weak, especially after consumption tax hike last year.
* BOJ expects CPI to hover around 0% for the time being. It means lower inflation will not be a guide to BOJ policies in future for the time being.
* BOJ will keep the purchase in line with previous guidance and will keep the average maturity at 7-10 years.

* Annual pace of purchase of ETFs and REITs will be about ¥ 3 trillion and ¥ 90 billion respectively.

* There will be no changes regarding commercial paper and corporate bonds and their size will be maintained at current ¥ 2.2 trillion and ¥ 3.2 trillion respectively.


BOJ running out of options -

* Liquidity concerns in JGB market is weighing on BOJ decisions. BOJ originally started purchasing assets to reach 2% inflation target in next 2 years, however deadline was dropped in later meetings.

* From inflationary point, BOJ policy seems to have failed so far and it is not clear whether further action to buy government bonds would do any better.

* However, it might still reach target and increase the pace of purchase without causing liquidity issues by moving into other asset class like municipal bonds, corporate bonds or equities.

Impact -

* Yen strengthened after the policy release, traded 119.7 against dollar. However lost grounds currently trading at 119.9.

* Today's FOMC minutes will provide guidance ahead.

15-04-08,Three more cuts expected from National Bank of Hungary,"Hungary's inflation accelerated to -0.6% y/y in March from -1.0% y/y in February and of -1.4% y/y in January. The main factor has been acceleration in food, alcohol and tobacco inflation; core inflation remained unchanged at 1.0% y/y. Base effects from financial services contributed to the increase, and prices of several other items also rose, other than energy.

Real sector indicators decelerated, but remained strong. Retail sales growth, at 6.2% y/y in February, moderated slightly from its January peak. Industrial production growth also decelerated, slowing to 5.8% y/y. These are still high levels and consistent with buoyant growth. Hungary retained its strong trade surplus, which has supported its current account surplus. Exports were up 7.4% y/y and imports rose 6.3%, both further indications of robust growth.

The National Bank of Hungary restarted its rate-cutting cycle last month with a 15bp reduction in the policy rate, to 1.95%. Recent statements have signaled that it will continue the cutting cycle. 

""With headline and core inflation still well below the 2-4% target, we expect three more cuts of 15bp each, which would bring the base rate to 1.5% by the end of this quarter"", said Barclays in a report on Wednesday.

15-04-08,Impact of RBI policy rate decision on the market,"Although the RBI maintained status quo on policy rates in line with market expectations, the absence of liquidity easing measures and uncertainty over the timing of the next rate cut disappointed the market. 

In response to the policy announcement, the benchmark 10Y Indian government bond (IGB) yield and 5Y OIS rate rose 4bps and 7bps, respectively. 

The OIS curve bear flattened by 3bps. It is likely to maintain a Positive outlook on IGBs and recommend that investors buy 10Y IGBs. The stance is underpinned by the expectation of another 25bps policy rate cut during Q2-2015. Expectation of a subsequent 25bps policy rate cut has become more uncertain, however. 

To reflect this uncertainty, the target is fine-tuned for the long 10Y IGB trade recommendation and revised it to 7.50%, from 7.40% (entry: 8.08%, current: 7.77%; revised stop-loss: 8.00%). 

Standard Chartered says they do not think that the RBI's monetary policy easing cycle is over yet. Given the favourable CPI inflation dynamics until August 2015 (RBI estimate: c.4% y/y), they see room for the RBI to ease policy rates by at least 25bps. The 10Y IGB yield is currently trading c.27bps higher than the repo rate and is yet to price in further monetary easing, in their view. 

""We expect the markets to build up rate cut expectations closer to the June policy announcement, and remain range-bound until then. The near-term supply dynamics appear mixed. The planned net issuance in May is INR 771bn (versus April's INR 480bn), which is likely to exert supply pressure on IGBs"", Says Standard Chartered

However, June is a month of favourable supply dynamics, with IGB redemptions exceeding the planned issuance by INR 82bn - this should cap a significant rise in IGB yields.

The March statement no longer referred to a ""prudent"" stance, but the growth forecast downgrades, the lower 'dot plot' trajectory, and the lower forecasts for full-employment (now 5.1% unemployment) gave the meeting a dovish tone.

While it will be interesting to see how the FOMC members justified these adjustments, the minutes may look 'stale' as several important speeches since then (from Chair Yellen, Vice Chair Fischer, the New York Fed's Dudley) were mostly on the dovish side. 

Reference to a ""midyear"" rate hike has given way to one ""before year-end"". In addition, March payrolls were soft, vindicating the Fed's current caution.",9

He is also one of the more criticized investing personalities, and I find the Hot/Cold dynamic of all toward him very fascinating. 

Whether you love him or hate him, Jim Cramer has become a force of knowledge for investors and his influence is widespread. Let's reach out to Jim Cramer on Twitter and convince him to allow Redditors to pick his brain and ask him anything. 

**My 5 Questions:**

1. How do you deal with the pressure and responsibility that comes with recommending investment advice to hundreds of thousands of viewers?
2. What has been the most rewarding part of hosting Mad Money for the last 10 years?
3. What would you say to someone that knows nothing about the stock market, but has a desire to learn?
4. You seem to have a lot of haters and trolls that shadow you at all times; why do you believe that some love to hate you?
5. Do you have any major regrets or disappointments throughout your time hosting Mad Money?

15-04-08,Professional Bullion Traders: What business advice would you give yourself if you could go back 10 years in time?,"I am a professional trader and an entrepreneur. I have done business development in many different segments of the financial markets (eg. establishing a fx broker, white labeling a front end, establishing a hedge fund etc. ) but never ever looked into this niche: physical bullion trading. Now I am sensing an opportunity in the local market and looking for valuable insight from professionals in this field.

My country is among the largest gold markets in the world. But in terms of technology, legal infrastructure and business know-how we were lagging the world by at least 10 years. Recently that is changing. Nasdaq OMX is renewing the whole infra of our exchanges (including the local precious metals exchange) and they are delivering know-how &amp; advisory services. A large vault with 1500 tons capacity is being established. A deal is signed with London Stock Exchange and local assets will be traded in LME in the near future and so on. It is like the exchanges are in a time machine...

By the end of 2016 the infrastructure of the local markets will be inline with a developed country. But local players will lag adapting to that. So my question to the professionals in physical bullion trading: what kind of an opportunity would you look for in this sort of an environment? What business advice would you give yourself if you could go back 10 years in time?",0
15-04-08,Future Tech Booms,"I have been thinking about where we are going to experience tech booms in the coming decade and two distinct sectors come to mind.  The first is 3d printing, hang on hear me out. I know this technology has been around for a while and the boom is clearly happening. However were at a stage comparable to computers in the 80s, corporations use them but only a select few geeks have them at home. The winning formula is to create an economic easy to use machine that people can use in their home.  First company to get this formula with proper branding will be a huge winner.  Makerbot is on the right track but if anyone has any other suggestions for companies to follow I would love to hear them.

The second boom, which will probably come later but still within a decade is the augmented reality and virtual realty technology. Augmented reality would be head up display, where as virtual you would be fully submersed into the virtual space. Although they sound similar they are clearly very different.  Im just beginning to research this space and would appreciate any leads anyone can throw my way.

I'm considering starting a Roth IRA with Vanguard since there's a few days left to fund 2014.  Since I haven't had time to evaluate the various funds, I was thinking I'd start with putting the money in their Prime Money Market Fund just to get the funds in before Apr 15 deadline (yes I realize the return is less than the expense ratio).  
  
This will give me time to decide which fund I'll ultimately put the money in for growth.  I'm curious, is the process simple to transfer from fund to fund (i.e. out of the prime money market fund to say, a target date fund).   What's the cost, etc. ?

Up to this point about 25+k lost on all attempts to short the current equity market.  Failure after failure after failure after failure.  

Whenever there appears to be some ""sun"" over the horizon, boom another failed attempt.    I.e. was short over the holiday.  Bam, market soars up back roughly 400 points from futures low in hours.

This charade (imo) has lasted longer than I expected.   It would help this post if I could put my thoughts into their proper perspective but having (perhaps just) realized that short attempt after short attempt yields nothing but abject failure it is hard to think clearly.  This has been a 6 month ""battle"" thus far.  We go down 200, come back up 201, go down 300, come back up 320. 

Sighs - well at least I can say I tried to change my economic situation by seizing opportunity but It has only left me a broken man in many regards.  I suppose, then (given the current environment) that greed is good and more is better... upwards we go in all equities.  

I have failed miserably in understanding the overall rationale of this market and it has cost me dearly.

To the bulls, I say... enjoy your profits; even here I don't know if this is said out of sincerity.  I've almost lost all faith in myself and have definitely lost all faith in markets. (This coming from an Economics major)

 I enter shorts now with the expectation to loose as strange as it may seem. I can only try.

 

Anyways, to all... take it easy.

15-04-09,"China's money and credit growth to soften","
It has been difficult to forecast China's money growth since September 2014 when the banking regulator announced it would impose punitive measures on large volatility in banks deposits. Chinese banks then started to behave and scale back their quarter-end deposit-snatching competition. 

As a result, the money growth rates derived from the stock data have diverged from those adjusted and reported by the central bank. Compounding this is the unpredictable nature of the post-holiday effects, thus forecasting money growth in March becomes a big  challenge. 

Observing the adjustments done by the central bank for September and December data last year, the reported M2 growth is likely to have shown little change in March. However, the unadjusted data should have shown a notable drop. The growth of both bank lending and non-banking credit is expected to soften. 
Societe Generale forecasts CNY1,100bn net increases in bank loans, not an unusual number for March - and it implies a small decline in the yoy growth of the stock of bank loans to 14% from 14.1%. Meanwhile, credit growth in the shadow bankingsector is likely to remain affected by tighter regulations and rising risk aversion. The monthly volume might rebound, albeit less than suggested by a normal seasonal pattern.

The official FX reserves to decline further from $3,840bn at end-2014 to $3,800bn at end-Q1 2015. The sharp depreciation of the euro should have been a factor, and the central bank also sold down its FX reserves at the beginning of the year to support the yuan.

Comparing this to the iPhone 4 which obtained 600,000 pre-orders and the iPhone 4S of 1 million – this is HUGE! What is more, the company’s shares have risen over 70% this year… WOW!
Furthermore, analysts have predicted that Apple could sell 10 million units by the end of the month and 50-60 million by the end of this year!
Consider Apple’s stock over the last 10 years: (if you are new to investing, not many company’s stock charts look like this)
 Best Investment
Apple Inc. Stock
September 2002 – $7.25 per share
September 2012 – $696.25 per share
To put this in perspective, if you invested $1000 in Apple ten years ago, you would have $96,034.50 today – a gain of 9600%!! Not bad huh? The question is, where does it stop? If you had stock in apple back in 2007 / 2008 you might have thought that the drop that was to come would finish apple. Oh how disappointed you would have been if you sold your shares.
You need an awful lot of money in the first place to invest in a company like apple when an ordinary share is priced so high.

15-04-09,Binary Options Trading: What You Need To Know,"Binary option trading is a relatively new development in the retail trading world. Five years ago, no one had even heard of it.

Since 2012 however, the popularity of binary options surged as a result of aggressive marketing by binary option brokers, and the promotion of binary trading software by the trading ""gurus"".

Right now, interest on the topic continues to grow at record levels. Given its current popularity, binary options are likely to be the first ""asset"" that beginners start trading with.

However, just because something is new and popular... doesn't mean it's worth doing. (Who remembers the fuss over bitcoin trading?)

Opportunities come and go all the time in the retail trading space... and it's important for us to tell the difference between sustainable business models and short-lived fads.

So let's take a moment to examine binary options, and see if it's something we should be paying attention to.

But before we do that, let's first take a quick look at traditional (i.e. vanilla) option contracts.


VANILLA FOREX OPTIONS

Traditional option contracts were initially introduced for people to hedge against future uncertainty.

For example, a German company selling cars in the United States would worry about high EUR/USD exchange rates in the future.

Why?

Because then they would be getting revenue in a weaker currency (USD) while having to pay expenses in a stronger currency (Euro) in their home country. This results in a significantly lower net profit, or even worse, a net loss.

Forex option contracts were thus introduced to solve this problem, as any losses stemming from currency fluctuations could be offset by profits made from buying options contracts.

To continue with the example, the German car company may choose to buy EUR/USD call options, which would profit from an increasing EUR/USD rate. Thus, any operational losses in the future (due to a high EUR/USD rate) can be offset by the profits gained from those option contracts.

This is, and continues to be, the main purpose of Forex option contracts.

Now of course, in order for the German company to buy call options, someone has to be willing to sell it to them.

Perhaps, a financial institution in France does not believe that the EUR/USD will continue to strengthen over the next 12 months, and so is willing sell call options to the German company.

(This, by the way, is how financial markets work. Participants have varying views of the future, and so trade against each other in line with their own expectations.)

In this transaction, the German company pays a fee (in buying call options) to protect against future currency risk, while the financial institution gets paid to take on that risk.

To summarize:

	- The German car company looks to limit future currency risk by buying call options
	- The financial institution (or speculator) collects a fee from selling call options and assumes the currency risk

More generally:

	- Option buyers pay a fixed fee for the potential of a very large profit
	- Option sellers collect a fixed fee for the potential of a very large loss


FOREX BINARY OPTIONS

In a vanilla option trade, the buyer does not know in advance the amount of money he stands to win. Similarly, the seller does not know in advance the amount of money he stands to lose. The amount is ultimately determined by how far the market price moves.

In a binary option trade however, the trader will know in advance the &lt;em&gt;exact&lt;/em&gt; amount he stands to win or lose, before taking the trade. Binary options are named as such because there are exactly only two possible outcomes: you either win a fixed amount, or lose a fixed amount.

Binary options ask a simple question: will the price be above [price level] at [time]?

For example: will the EUR/USD be above 1.3000 at 4.30pm? If you think so, you buy the binary option. If you don't, you sell.

That's pretty much all there is to binary options.

UPSIDE OF BINARY OPTIONS

As you can see, binary option trading can be simply explained and is easily understood. This is a big benefit to new traders, as they can quickly learn the basic mechanics and start trading right away.

A related benefit of this, is having to make fewer trading decisions.

In spot forex trading, for example, one has to decide:

	- Where and when to enter the market
	- The appropriate trading lot size to use
	- How to manage the trade
	- Where and when to close the trade

In binary option trading however, there are only 2 decisions to make:

	- Whether the market price will be above a certain price level at a certain time
	- How much to risk on the trade

As such, binary options offer a much simpler trading process. You don’t have to think about (or calculate) leverage and margin at all.

And, since the potential loss on each trade is fixed, you will never get a margin call.

Lastly, options offer traders the unique ability to make money by predicting where prices will NOT go. (This goes for all types of options, not just binary options.) This can’t be done in the spot Forex market.

So… does binary option trading sound good?

Sure it does!

Well... at first glance, anyway.

Now let’s take a look at the downsides of binary option trading. These are the things your binary option broker won’t tell you.

DOWNSIDE OF BINARY OPTIONS TRADING

The most obvious downside of binary option trading is the lack of flexibility.

For example, if the market price moves even one pip against you upon option expiry, you’ll lose your entire stake. You can’t choose to defer your trade exit under any circumstances.

Also, with some binary option brokers, you can’t change your mind and close or modify a trade before expiry. In this sense, a binary option trade is typically an all-or-nothing proposition.

These points on inflexibility can be summarized by the following comment (found in the Forex Factory forums):

""I once traded a forex news item where I closed a wrong call with a 20 pips loss, and ended up making 350 pips on the reverse trade, giving me a net profit of 330 pips. This scenario cannot be replicated in binary options.”

Lastly, the value of a binary option is fixed between 0 and 100, with the broker charging a bid-ask spread and often, a commission as well. The implication of these factors is that the average loss per trade will always be larger than the average profit. This is a structural (i.e. inherent) characteristic of the binary option game.

Thus, in order to break even, a binary option trader would have to win at least 55% of the time. Compare this to spot Forex trading, where a trader can be profitable by winning just 40% (or less) of the time.

MY PERSONAL OPINION

On paper, binary options are an opportunity seeker’s wet dream.

The promise of regular fixed payouts and a focus on short-term profits are exactly the characteristics that appeal to people looking for a quick buck.

Unfortunately for them, what feels good in trading is typically a losing approach.

You see... the only way to keep making money with binary options is to accurately predict market prices at least 55% of the time, AND get the timing right. This is an exceptionally difficult feat to accomplish.

In other words, you can correctly predict future market prices AND STILL LOSE because you got the timing wrong by a few minutes. 

HOWEVER

All this said, there may be a genuine opportunity here… and that is to be a seller of binary options.

Why? Because it’s a lot easier to estimate where prices will 'not go', rather than trying to predict where it will. Whenever the market settles at a particular price level, it is not settling at a dozen other price levels.

Does this make sense?

This root concept may then be expanded to form a complete binary option trading strategy that you can use.

Note however, that this is a benefit available to all types of options, not just binary options.

SO, ARE BINARY OPTIONS JUST A FAD?

One reservation I have about binary options is that they do not serve a major commercial purpose. Unlike the spot and derivatives markets that serve to benefit society, binary options exist solely for speculation purposes.

In other words, it can be reasonably argued that binary option trading is not much different than a casino game.

Without a commercial purpose, binary options could be banned tomorrow and not impact anyone else other than the brokers and speculators.

Compare this to spot Forex trading, or Forex futures trading, upon which global commerce relies. These markets are unlikely to be closed or banned, because they serve a useful purpose beyond speculation.

As a retail trader for the past 10 years, I’ve seen all sorts of gimmicks and fads come and go. Some years ago, expert advisors were the hot topic. Slowly but surely, people are now gradually realizing that ""automated trading"" isn't as amazing as it's cracked up to be.

Will binary options follow suit?

My opinion is yes, I think they will.

Binary options do not provide any major benefit to serious traders, and I think that once the opportunity seekers get bored or lose enough money, they’ll lose interest and turn their attention to the next shiny object.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

So... do you particularly agree or disagree with any of the points I’ve mentioned? Did I miss mentioning any important points?

Let me know what you think!

15-04-08,For newbies - shorting explained,"Some of you newbies might see posts from Badbaseball and TuffAdams (great dudes to follow and learn) Anyway, Badbaseball uses a lot of terms like ""risking the short"" or ""I will be shorting this XYZ at this price $"" So what does he mean by this?

Everybody knows the basic concept is Buy Low -&gt; Sell High. When you are shorting a stock you are Selling High -&gt; Buying Low. How does this work?

Scenario TSLA is currently trading at $200. Badbaseball, through expert analysis, thinks it is going to drop to $150 very soon. He wants to make money on TSLA going down.

Badbaseball would go to his broker and say, ""I would like to rent/borrow a share"" Broker says no problem and gives Badbaseball a share from one of his other clients. Now Badbaseball has a share at the current price so $200. BB is now going to sell this share when he thinks its at its highest point before it drops. So BB sells this share instantly at $200. So now he has $200 and 0 shares, BUT now he OWES 1 share to his broker because he borrowed one from the broker’s client.

So now BB has to pay the broker back 1 share. Well BB already analyzed the share price is going to drop to $150. So when the price drops to $150 he will buy it and send it back to his broker.

Summary: Buying Low -&gt; Selling High, when shorting you are using the same concept just going backwards Selling High -&gt; Buying Low. There are other scenarios that play in here, like if the person he borrowed from decides to sell their share while he is borrowing it, but hopefully this helps you understand his strategy/terms a little.

Hope this helps, I could draw a diagram and post it going over Assets | Liabilities which might help. If you have any questions just post. Apologies to BB if he does not approve of this..",9

I think that the company that caught my eye, in particular, is First Solar FSLR. I understand that one of the foremost criticisms for FSLR is it's unconventional use of cadmium telluride instead of silicone. From what I read, however, it seems that it is a pretty well-balanced trade-off due to the material's low cost. Secondly, FSLR is introducing a new line of solar panels using silicone and spends $144m (iirc) on research and development. It seems to me that FSLR is playing with the big picture in mind. My second choice would be SunPower SPWR, but I don't want to spend too much time making a huge wall of text. I have looked at almost all the top solar energy companies in the industry and these two come out on top in my mind. Does anyone have any insight or guidance on this industry or these stocks in particular?  

The second topic I would like to discuss is stocks that pay dividends. I have been looking for a relatively stable company that pays high dividends, but I am having trouble understanding some of these stocks. Navios Maritime NMM offers a 14.58 yield at 12.14 - how can they pay out that much? Do I understand the way dividends work? Would i be doubling my money as long as their stock remains the same and pays out that quoted dividend? While NMM puzzles me and makes me cautious to go anywhere near it, Starwood Property STWD seems lucrative and relatively safe.

There are 3 securities left to deal with. 

The two stocks, 1000 shares of DVO Inc and 2000 shares of Bre-X Minerals, that are worth nothing, they want the estate to gift to them (the broker).  They claim it will give the estate a tax break. I can't find anything on DVO, but recall Bre-X from from a big scandal 20+yrs ago. I don't have cost basis on either stock, and neither could be traded today. Could this gifting be a way to create a loss on a stock that can't be sold? 

The 3rd one is 10,000 shares of Celtic Minerals, which is trading at $0.01 with no volume today. Again I don't have the cost basis, but I'm assuming the only value is if there was a loss that could somehow be realized for tax purposes. 

So assuming we find a way to sell Celtic, does this giftign fo the other 2 equities to the broker make any sense to anyone?

15-04-09,What Fundamentals Affect Commodity Prices Edit |,"In the previous post I explained the basics of commodity investing. In this post, I’m going to explain exactly what fundamental factors affect commodity prices.

A Precursor
Commodity prices tend to rise and fall together, much like how stock prices rise and fall together. As the saying goes, “a rising tide lifts all boats”. If the entire U.S. economy is doing well, generally all stocks will go up. The fundamentals below impact all commodity prices.

Inflation
Inflation is a huge factor that can impact commodity prices. Thanks to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, all commodities are officially listed in U.S. dollars. Here are two important terms that you need to know

Nominal value
Real value
The nominal value of a commodity is the “official price”. If gold per ounce is at $1300 right now, then the nominal value is $1300. If inflation is 100% (a hypothetical scenario), then the nominal value of gold will also increase by 100%, doubling to $2600 per ounce.

The real value of a commodity takes into account for inflation. Let’s assume that gold is at $1300 an ounce. If inflation increases by 100%, the nominal value will increase, but the real value is exactly the same. There’s just more U.S. dollars chasing after the same amount of gold in this world!

As investors, we only care about the nominal value. Thus, when inflation picks up, commodity prices soar across the board! This is what happened in Germany with hyperinflation in the 1930’s – a loaf of bread cost a bajillion Marks (Germany’s currency at the time) to buy. The real value didn’t change (a loaf of bread is still a loaf of bread), but the nominal value exploded.

This is what happened in the U.S. during the 1970s (although it wasn’t as severe as it was in Germany). U.S. inflation skyrocked (14% per year), and commodity price spiked in the 1970s. Gold went from $30 an ounce to $600 an ounce.

Right now, we are seeing the early phases of inflation where inflation will pick up but has not started yet. Ben Bernake (Chairman of the Federal Reserve) has a genius solution to America’s economic woes – print money! That’s essentially the name of the game for his consecutive rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE). Sooner or later, this money printing is going to catch up to him (or us American taxpayers, actually) with huge inflation. And what happens when inflation hits? Commodity prices skyrocket.

Increased Demand, Decreased Supply
There is a fixed amount of supply in this world – it’s not like we can manufacture gold (alchemy!) or copper. On the other hand, demand is increasing exponentially. Can you imagine if every person in the world lived the way us Americans did! Considering the amount of stuff we waste each year (that’s how my relatives from Europe put it), the world’s resources would be depleted in a heart beat.

With developing nations increasing their standards of living, the world’s demand for raw materials such as oil and copper is outstripping supply. The Chinese are a huge buying force in the world – they are rebuilding their country after:

1800s: Britain literally robs China of all its gold and silver by drugging the entire nation with Opium (prior to the 1800s, drugs didn’t exist in China). It’s called The Century of Humiliation. China went from #1 in the world (literally, the “Middle Kingdom”) to dead last.
Early 1900s: Chinese Civil War
1950 – 1978: the Communist fiasco (Chairman Mao ruined China).
So really, China’s literally been rebuilding its entire country over the past 30 years. And because China is so big (both geographically and population wise), China consumes a ton of resources.

This trend in increasing demand and shrinking supply is only going to continue, thereby pushing up commodity prices. Factor in some more inflation thanks to King Bernake from the Federal Reserve, and you have the perfect set up for a long term bull market in commodities.

Thanks for reading! As I side note, I have something for y’all bloggers out there (and no, this is not an ad or a promotional gimmick).

If you want to trade in a similar style to me, in the morning figure out a good entry point when a stock begins to hold. When I say hold I mean this: The stock is unable to breakout into new HOD's and this ""pricepoint"" took in a lot of volume. That is almost always how I get short into a morning parabolic move.

**KONE** has Float: 1.13M so beware of float rotation.  I would like to see this gap below 6, fail to breakout and washout. I would go short risking off that mark (6). If in an odd case it begins to ramp up, I will keep an eye on the 6.50 - 7 mark to get short.






**VLTC** is another super low float stock, so beware of short squeezes. I think one of 2 things will happen. 1: A gap up, parabolic to the 4.50 - 4.70 mark. 2:  The stock cannot hold 4 and will washout. Either way I will get short risking off the HOD. Will be adding onto pops. I will be shorting the ""back side of the move"".



**AMCN** appears to be up on this: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/airmedia-sells-5-equity-interest-of-its-advertising-business-for-rmb150-million-2015-04-07?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts). If the stock is unable to hold and break the 2.75 mark, I will get short risking off that mark. If the stock begins to parabolic, I will be looking to get short at around the 3 mark (if it holds). I will be shorting anticipating a washout (remember, it has to hold) and will be adding into pops.



**MOBI** Will depend highly on how it holds the 4.70 support. If it snaps and fails to breakout again, I will get short risking off that mark. If the stock begins to parabolic, I will be looking at the 5 spot to hold and if it does I will get short risking off that mark. Shorting parabolic moves and adding into pops.",3

15-04-09,US dollar strength in Q1,"[Chart of the day: Disappointing US data has been ignored](http://www.fxwirepro.com/data/charts/USD.png.png)

In the wake of weaker US job data, investor clients have generally been focused on two key issues: (1) fading US economic prospects and (2) outside of the US, a possible policy inflection point, with the momentum of further policy easing seen to be slowing rapidly.

""The two issues are linked in so far as US dollar (USD) strength in Q1 was, in our view, largely driven by currency weakness against the USD rather than by robust US economic data"" says Standard Chartered

The Bloomberg US Economic Surprise Index has fallen sharply since 12 February, after some initial hesitation in early February. The only US data print that showed consistent strength was US non-farm payrolls (NFP) - until March. 

The USD was able to ignore this for quite some time, precisely because the market was focused on easing outside of the US. The momentum of this easing has appeared to slow in the past two weeks, while US NFP data was also materially weaker than expected.

The result has been a material reduction of long USD positions by the speculative community. Investors have also begun to question whether the end of policy easing in the likes of Europe and Asia is at hand. 

The answer is an unequivocal 'no', but, what of the risk of stronger US economic data in Q2? Not only is the market not pricing this in, but it also appears to be looking the other way, dwelling on whether US Q1 real GDP growth will be 1% or 2% q/q SAAR given weather-related distortions, when it could be above 3% in Q2.

15-04-09,FOMC rates and market reaction,"
The minutes were not as dovish as market pricing after the March meeting, or pricing going into the release of the minutes, would suggest. 

The FOMC believes that the weakness in 1Q growth has been largely due to transitory forces, and doesn't need to see signs of pickup in PCE or wage inflation to bolster confidence about the inflation outlook.

BofA Merrill Lynch says they continue to be positioned short in the front end as they expect growth data to rebound in coming months. There was some clarification about the exit strategy as well: the Fed formalized their base case, which is to maintain a 25bp fed funds target range with IOER on the top and the ON RRP rate on the bottom.

The Fed is willing to increase the capacity of the RRP program during the initial stages of liftoff, but today's minutes indicated that the Fed intends to shrink the facility fairly soon afterward. 

One way to do this would be to raise IOER above the fed funds target range, widening the IOER-RRP spread beyond 25bp. Another idea officials discussed is to sell short term Treasuries, thereby permanently draining excess reserves by accelerating the normalization of the balance sheet.This would reduce the reliance on the ON RRP facility and tighten the link between the effective fed funds rate and IOER.

There is no holding period or transference that should prevent the employee from executing the trade post haste.

15-04-09,"The Crash of 1970 - A brief reflective look on the similarities and differences of ""Back-to-Earth-Day""","As I am writing this, the market is currently at a major upswing.  As the sixth year anniversary of the ending of the market correction of the late-2000’s bring forth an age of optimism for investors, said investors will inevitable repeat the same mistakes that have been brought forth upon generation-after-generation of previous investors.  Individual investors, now a part of a larger form through mutual funds, will put their money primarily into speculative stocks, with billions of shares traded every day in record time. At the end of the market cycle, these same investors that put their money into speculation will find that the stocks they bought at an inflated value would now be sellable at a dear price. 

One ending of a bullish cycle often forgotten in the history books is one that involves computers.  In this story, many made billions off of the development of innovations in the computer business, be it from a blue chip company (such as IBM), or a speculative company (such as EDS).  Recovering from a recession prior to the then-current bull market, many investors decided to rapidly purchase shares into computer stocks, choosing to ignore the significance of the P/E ratio in favor of future growth.   Opponents to the bloated bull market, including a younger Warren Buffet, often objected to the rapid growth of the market, noting that the fair value of the average technology company was much less than what Mr. Market had advertised. 

This forgotten era’s crash does not take place in 2000, nor does it take place today.  Rather, the crash I am referring to revolves around the crash of 1970. In parallel to the events of 2000, 1970, specifically April 22nd, was the year that the market crumbled mainly due to the stocks from the technology sector.  

Like the American Civil War, a war that bridged the gap between Napoleonic battle formations with World War I trench fare, the crash of 1970 gapped certain manias that gripped 1929 under the modern-day pretense of institutional investors. This was a feat only thought of by John Brooks in “The Go-Go Years,” a book that readers that desire an understanding of the 1970 crash should read.  The crash of 1970 had been the last major one to start a downward trend on the basis of emotion, unlike the panics of 1987, 2000, and 2008, all of which floundered due to collapsing fundamentals.  Under this crash, it was the first one where the modern day mutual-and-hedge fund industry was adversely affected. 

The difference between the crash of 1970 and the downturn of 2009 is primarily based on effect from the crash, and secondarily by length of said effect.  When technology stocks crashed in 1970, the result set upon a decade long precedence in the immediate market.  In correlation with the oil crises of 1973 and 1979, respectively, an unprecedented period of stagflation (a phenomena thought impossible until the 1970’s), as well as a series of questionable fiscal policies, the economic effects of the crash of 1970 lasted into the 1990’s, owing to the S&amp;P 500 being unable to break free from their peak until right before another bubble, the dot-com one, began.  Meanwhile, due to the fact that there had been little correlation with regards to the crash of 2008, within six years after the end of the bear market, said market experienced record peaks in all sectors of finance.  
	
Regardless of said differences, however, lessons from the crash of 1970 could have been used in stopping the crash in 2008. That the failure of the average investor towards realizing the heavily speculative nature of the stocks they invested into was seen in both crashes, although the stocks that were careless invested into were from different areas.  That the effects of these market correction expanded beyond non-investors became evident when families had to re-adjust their lives, all of these lessons could have prevented the market from collapsing in 2008.   
	
The importance of this history lesson, the crash of 1970, in today’s economy is the result of this current generation’s preference towards investing into a splurge of stocks that pose little benefit to the investor in the long-run. In the short-run, virtually any stock, as seen through Charter Communications, can have a balance sheet that is abysmal, ratios that limit long-term success, and prospects that lack innovation.  However, in the long-run, these speculative stocks, trendy in nature, can create mania; and when gobbled up by the institution, can prove to be catastrophic for the collective.

15-04-09,"Want to Buy A House? Big Considerations Most People Don't Talk About","Our culture tells everyone to buy a home.

Pretty tame in comparison to cultures that cut peoples heads off.

Still, I think buying a home (to live in personally) is the worst financial decision a person can make.

There are advantages: you have much more freedom to do what you like with your house vs a rental, but this comes at a cost. I want to show you the costs.

This is a monster of a post, so if you don't have time, read a section or two and come back later, or sit down when you have 30 minutes to avoid the worst financial decision of your life.

If you don’t like finance, skip to the ""Flexibility"" section, and just take my word: the finances will kick your butt. Also, learn to like finance, because being poor isn't awesome.

Finances

The best way to understand an long-term real estate investment is through the cash flows.
If you invest in Google (2001) or Apple (2006), then you can imagine the company miiiiight double next year, but your house won’t.

When you buy a house, you have an initial cash-flow of 20% for a down payment. This is cash that cannot be invested in other things, and most importantly: isn’t in cash.

I’m going to use Chicago numbers for homes: They’re more stable (midwest real estate is more cash-flow focused vs speculative pricing swings, think Phoenix or Las Vegas) and they still have high prices (Sears Tower/Loop).

According to Zillow.com, the median home price: $239,000 for the neighborhood of Norridge Park, a middle class town near Chicago proper, with a comparable 3 bedroom single family home renting for $1995.00/month

Let’s talk about OWNING.

Down payment is the first large cash outflow.

You put 20% of the total value down and sign up to have someone else pay the rest of the 80%.

You buy a home in Chicago, and you’re going to be paying $47,800 to just get your name on it.

After that, you’ll have an annual property tax bill of 1.84% (Chi standard) - $4397.60.

Remember, when your property tax is 1.84% of home value, as your property increases in value, so does your property tax. Also, the rate has gone up 50% in the last 5 years.

The typical maintenance rate is 2%. You should save 2% value of the house per year to pay for (roof, HVAC, plumbing, driveway, gutters, drywall, foundation and a whole lot more). If the house is older, put double that, but let's be conservative.

If you don't actually spend the money, you should allocate the money in case next month your roof starts leaking or your basement floods. 

By the way, you better be sure that the insurance is going to pay out (you understand and bought the right kind...right?), if not, you're on the hook for whole kit-n-caboodle.

Average Illinois Homeowners insurance: $847 per year

Closing costs, including bank fees, prepaid interest, escrow fees: $6,519

Edit: I forgot to include title insurance, which is $200-$1000, so I'm not going to recalculate everything, but notice that it's actually worse against owning. And if you don't get title insurance, you might not actually own the property you just spent 3 months and thousands of dollars trying to buy.

[Year One Cash-flows - Owning](http://i.imgur.com/lrrnG7y.png)

So year one, owning the house, cash flows come out to $92,700.89 of total cash leaving YOUR POCKET.

[Year One Cash-flows - Renting](http://i.imgur.com/3xWTsLo.png)

Renting the exact same house would cost $24,000 per year, plus a $2000 security deposit, and $100 renter's insurance.

Year one renting: $26,100 out the door.

Year one owning: $92,700 out the door.

Renting would leave $66,600 in your bank account because you didn't own.

I'm not even going to consider the opportunity cost of what else you could invest that in here.

[Year Two Cash-flows - Owning](http://i.imgur.com/bUHR4fJ.png)

Let's look at year two.

If you're quick on your feet you noticed the principal went up and interest went down.

They don't equal each other until about 15 years in. If you plan on moving in less than a decade, the huge majority of what you're paying is interest (""Renting is just throwing money away!"" lol).

And remember, that principal you're paying can only be recovered if the property remains, or grows in value.

If the property decreases in value that equity turns to smoke. #2009

Year two comes around, and things get closer: Owning has the edge by about $540, assuming a 2% increase in rent.

[Year Two Cash-flows - Renting](http://i.imgur.com/5oY2LHl.png)

No brainer right? Sure you take a hit on the first year, but the trend changes direction!

Wrong.

The payments are (barely) smaller, but you constantly have to worry about price swings of the underlying property (and if the price of your property goes up, so do property taxes).

What happens if you bought a condo in Vegas in 2006?

Your payments sure were lower!

And now you’re underwater a quarter mil.

When you rent, you’re paying $540 per year for the privilege of not-caring-at-all about what happens to the market price of whatever real estate asset you live in.

Are you a professional real estate investor?

Then you might havea good understanding of where the market is going and competing with them is a good idea.

When you buy a house, you’re competing with thousands of real estate investors, hedge fund managers, and REITs.

Do you think you’ve got a leg up on them?

If your day job is not ‘professionally investing in real estate’, I’d think twice about stepping into the ring against billionaires.

Do you really think you’re going to beat the market when you casually invest because you ‘totally can see your kids playing in the yard!”

""Buying a house because you need a place to live is like buying a restaurant because you need something to eat."" - Jack Sheppard

There was a real estate development at the university I went to, that was built on a former Westinghouse factory.

Westinghouse had polluted the land, so to make the development break even, they had to double the amount of units, making it 6 stories tall instead of 3 like they planned.

When you buy a house, you're putting yourself in a position where you could be held responsible for the pollution someone who owned the land before you.

Hopefully, they didn't have any roofing shingles underground, or live near a dry cleaner who was sloppy and polluted the ground. (Here's an EPA fine, without cleanup costs for $208,000)

**Flexibility**

Did you find out you moved next to a drug dealer or a fraternity after you moved in?

Are houses selling right now, or is it 2009?

Put your house on the market, watch it sit for 9 months, and then take a low-ball offer because you’re sick of living there and just want to get out.

Sorry if you just lost six years of savings…

Are you renting?

Pack your stuff and leave the next day, then sublet it on craigslist ASAP. Put it at 80% of the rent you’re paying and it’ll be subleased overnight.

You’ll take a small financial hit: that’s your Idiot Tax, lesson learned.

Within 3 days you don’t live next to a drug dealer, and you pay for that mistake for a hundred bucks a month until the lease ends.

What if instead of a crappy neighbor, you decide: let’s move to Barcelona!

Do the Drug-Dealer Shuffle™, and you can be on the plane before the weekend.

But what if?

At my last job, a guy with three girls under 18 months (oof) was moving to a new city to open an office and was selling his house.

Because money was so tight (commissioned salesman, with no sales), he didn't get the cheap insurance in case some appliance broke between the buyer accepting and the actual closing, it'd be covered.

The week before closing, and three weeks before he left for a new city, the water softener ($1500) and A/C ($800) both crapped out, and he was on the hook.

This is what owning a house does.

You're on the hook for everything.

I rent: the only thing I'm on the hook for is a new toaster.

Luckily I'm a man with means (lol).

Flexibility wasn't close either: are you more flexible having a ton of cash in the bank, or a property you have to manage?

Let’s see how day-to-day life changes if you rent or own.

Renting:

When you rent an apartment or house, like I do, I have a full-time, 24/7 on-call maintenance staff.

They shovel my sidewalks, mow the lawn, do the landscaping, fix my toilet, drain my bathtub when it won’t, fix my dryer and seriously anything I need besides vacuuming my apartment.

“I went to the Home Depot yesterday, which was unnecessary; I need to go to the Apartment Depot. It's just a bunch of guys standing in an empty building going ""Hey, we ain't gotta fix shit."" - Mitch Hedburg

I don’t have to fix anything. I hire people to do that for me.

Owning:

Congratulations! You’ve just accepted a $0.00/hr job offer for the following positions:

* Landscaper 

* Plumber 

* Washing Machine Repairman 

* Electrician 

* Snow-Shoveler 

* General Handyman 

If you don’t know how to do any of those, don’t worry, you can pay other people to do your job for you!

Just remember, you’re on call 24/7 for these jobs.

Huge freeze coming through? Hope your water pipes don’t burst!

When I had my office job, every single salesman (only people with houses) had to miss at least one full day of work because of burst pipes over the winter.

So they were:

Stopping making money, 

To go spend money on repair parts, 

To work for free. 

Sounds like a sucker’s bet in my book. (The pipes burst in a girl who worked there apartment complex too, and she just drove over the ice and went to work while maintenance cleaned up the mess.)


Are you sick of hobbies like relaxation, reading and having sex?


Have you tried “Paying to do labor?”


PS: I didn't include the financial and storage cost of all of the equipment you need to manage a house like lawnmower, weed whacker, snow-blower, plumbing equipment, carpentry equipment etc.


We'll call that a gimme, because I don't know where you're living and how much of Your Job you're willing to pay someone else to do.

**Conclusion**


Does this mean that you can't make money in real estate?

Abso-lute-ly not.

Thousands of people make damn good money in real estate.

But are they hustling and flipping houses, rehabbing apartment complexes, buying REO SFR's in bulk to unload to rehabbers or any other of a 100 ways to make money in real estate.

They are not buying and living in single family homes for 10 years.

There's two ways to invest: like a professional or an amateur.

When you decide to invest as an amateur, don't be surprised when professionals wipe the 
floor with you.

2. Search the company. Download the annual income statements (typically 10 years) and paste in sheet 'IS DL'. Download and paste annual balance sheet in 'BS DL'. Download and paste annual cash flow statement in 'CF DL'

3. In all three of those sheets, find and replace ""-"" with ""0"".

4. Move to sheet called 'Valuation'. Find and plug in current price. Also plug in equity beta found online (haven't set up a template to find equity beta from comparables yet).

5. Search for company in Morningstar's Bond Center. Ideally find a bond maturing 2035 or above and plug in it's rating and yield into the sheet. If you can't find one, given the company's rating, use the chart provided to find the average yield of a 20-year corporate bond.

6. Play around with the revenue growth estimates. The formula right now has revenue growth decreasing linearly over the next 10 years to 2%.

The story highlights the extreme efforts that the federal government has gone to limit it's disclosure in criminal proceedings by imposing non-disclosure agreements (NDA's) on local police departments from mentioning any of their signal collection activities using the device in any court case. 

The [Baltimore Police Department](http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2015/apr/08/baltimore-police-often-surveil-cellphones-amid-us/) has also mentioned these NDA's and discussed the amount of times these types of devices have been used over the past 7-8 years within their jurisdiction.

I've read No Place to Hide by Glenn Greenwald discussing the Edward Snowden case and have my own personal beliefs regarding government methods of data mining all communications but my question relates to the financial aspects of these stories being publicized. Do you see any type of backlash against the companies and organizations that manufacture these products or do you think the markets will not be effected?

Brings up the topic of **ethical** **investing** I guess and I never had to cross that bridge in my investment lifespan (7 years now) - or belay that, I've never decided to wrap my head around what I'm investing in when it comes to the uses from the products that I know about which are created by the companies that I'm positioned with. 

Kind of along the same lines as those who work in weapons manufacturing - how do they come to grips with their products being utilized to take lives?

* **How do you invest in companies that may go against your personal beliefs in terms of their products and efforts? (ie. tobacco, fossil fuels, junk food, etc)?**

15-04-09,Understanding Structured Settlements,"Hopefully everyone is having a great weekend. Today I have the pleasure of co-hosting a $1000 giveaway! You may well have already seen posts from some other cohosts relating to Structured Settlements or selling annuity; if not, make sure you enter here!
What is a Structured Settlement?
When we hear the term structured settlement or ‘periodic payment’, the first thing that comes to mind is probably injury court cases; perhaps a win that results in a payout from an insurance company. Essentially, instead of winning damages as a lump sum, a more recent and popular outcome is to be awarded a structured settlement; a sum of money which is awarded in installments. This has a number of advantages for all parties involved. For the company/person paying the damages, they are not required to outlay all of the money immediately – the immediate outlay of capital could bankrupt or seriously affect their future business potential. For the recipient; there is less chance of being financially irresponsible and blowing all the cash!
 Structured Settlement

When Structured Settlements Don’t Work
Like anything else, one solution does not fit all. While regular payments sound sensible and perhaps a better all-round solution, sometimes people need the capital immediately:
Paying for College – Depending on the time of the settlement, it could be advantageous to have a lump sum of money to help pay for your children’s university. This may prevent them taking out expensive student loans, or perhaps enable them to go when they wouldn’t otherwise.
Getting out of Debt - If you are in some serious debt, perhaps it would make sense to use the compensation to clear these immediately. Not only would it relieve your stress and worries, but it would free up a lot of your monthly income. Consequently, the extra money would have the same effect as the monthly structured settlement payment.
Paying off Your House – Using a lump sum payment to obliterate your mortgage gives the same result as paying off debt – it frees up money each month to spend on other things. In effect, you are replacing the monthly structured payment with a reduced mortgage / living cost and getting some peace of mind thrown in for free!
 
The Alternative
If one of the above scenarios applies to you, perhaps it is worth trading annuity payments for a lump sum. There are several companies who are willing to purchase your structured settlement and in return pay you an immediate lump sum. Obviously there are fees involved, but these can often be offset by high-interest rates that you would no longer be subjected to!",1

I'll put up [Anthem Inc (ANTM)](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ANTM) as a prospective example. Here are the numbers I'm aware of:

Price: ~153

EPS: 8.99 (Projected: 10.8)

Market Cap: 41.13B

Dividend: 1.6%

I've personally read through many articles that influenced me to give it a try. Although I'm not even one year into my three - five year loans, loans being issued are increasing and this is just the beginning!

In the first [picture](http://imgur.com/Y6jyGxD), you'll see my overall portfolio information. In the second [picture](http://imgure.com/VDXlZ2Y) there is a breakdown of how the adjusted annualized return is calculated. I started investing with $3000.00, which provided me 120 loans valued at $25.00 each on 10/14/14. Today, through re-investing alone, I now have 141 loans with varied interest rates. This brings my account value to $3525.00, which is a roughly a 18% total return.

For those who are interested, I hope this gives you the courage to invest. There are many more platforms besides LendingClub to where you can invest. Three months after investing with LendingClub, I did the exact same approach with Prosper and I'm seeing almost identical numbers.

15-04-10,[YOLO] Long AMBA Jan. 2016 $100 calls,"AMBA has been experiencing crazy growth, both fundamentally and in their stock price. You may have heard of them as a supplier of GPRO. They provide them with the video chips. Right now, their technology is top of the line with no direct competition. So they currently enjoy gross margins of 60-65% with net margins coming in around 20-25%. Their gross margin trend has remained steady throughout the past 3 years, while net income margin has been steadily increasing. Revenue has been growing steadily as well, about 30% from 2012 to 2013 and 38% from 2013 to 2014 (years actually end on Jan 31 of the next year for them, but I thought it looked silly saying to 2015 since we are still in it)

In their last conference call they upped their 5 year growth estimates from 22-25% CAGR to 27-30% CAGR. That is pretty significant in my eyes. A lot of that growth is going to be coming from the personal video camera market, but they are seeing incredible growth in some of their smaller segments as well. Personally, I think security cameras will be their next biggest driver. With all the police shooting incidents and push for bodycams, AMBA stands to do very well supplying the chips needed for that technology. 

GPRO is currently their largest customer which poses some risk, but they have been steadily diversifying away from that. I believe each quarter has been less of a total percent of revenue from GPRO than the last. With the new xiaomi camera deal, they will be able to achieve that goal even more. What is really impressive about that partnership is that xiaomi cameras are being sold at a fraction of the price of Gopros, but AMBA is making the same amount of money per chip. Their technology is so top of the line and desirable, that a ""knockoff"" version is willing to pay the full price tag for that component. That speaks to me.

With all this fundamental growth, the share price will obviously have to respond positively. There was a large short interest in this stock, but it has been steadily declining after the last earnings report. The shorts finally are figuring out that this is truly a growth stock. It has made impressive returns thus far, but I don't think that trend is near over yet, not with everything going on at this company and the industries they are in. Did I mention drones yet by the way? They are supplying chips for that too, even if it is a small sector of their business, if it takes off that are well positioned. 

Anyways, I would recommend picking up the Jan. 2016 $100 calls. That gives you enough time to ride it up slowly and weather any downswings. I would sell half of the position if the underlying is at $85 or higher before the next earnings report. If not, I would ride the whole thing out. I think it is very plausible that AMBA will be trading at around $100 by september to november, as long as the earnings report in the mean time continue to display their growth story. This trade could easily return 100-200% so lemme know what you think Lord Yolo",1

I'm looking to liquidate a bunch of my stock into cash and am looking at a fairly large cash gain. I utilize both Etrade and Vanguard (index funds only). Everything I sell will qualify for long-term capital gains.

a) When I sell, does either company withhold taxes on the capital gains?

b) If they do not, does it mean I only pay the withholding taxes when filing taxes next year?

If I am receiving the gross proceeds from the liquidation including the tax liable to the US government, I'm assuming that cash is actually free flow money available for use up until I have to pay the US government. Please let me know if I'm wrong.

If everything goes exceptionally well for Tesla over the next 5 years it will still be greatly overvalued at its current levels.1. Electric car sales growth is declining and BMWs electric cars are taking market share.2. It's heavily dependant on government subsidies.3. Non GAAP financials are emphasized and a huge gamble has been taken to buy back model S cars with lease-style options just to be able to bring sales revenue forward and to meet requirements for government subsidies.4. Outside of a charismatic CEO (who has his hands tied w/ 3 companies) Tesla doesn't really have a strategic moat. i.e. Other car companies are already expanding their electric car segments w/ more resources to back them.*edit - A lot of hate (down votes) on my comments but they are well founded.

Today, the Nova Scotian provincial government announced massive film production tax credit reductions, which will result in a less competitive environment for foreign and even Canadian film productions compared to other provinces or American states that will offer better credits.

[DHX Media](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHX_Media). Today the CEO expressed his concern:
&gt;“The government has killed the local industry - that may not have been their intention but that’s what they have done. The NS government doesn’t understand the impact. Fundamentally, they have made the NS film tax credit un-bankable in Canada. You can bank a refundable tax credit but you cannot bank a non- refundable one. That’s the key to complicated international financing""

In 2010 he was quoted as saying:
&gt;“Eliminating the cap on labour for the Film Industry Tax Credit will, I believe, be beneficial for animation because of the disproportionately labour intensive nature of this part of the industry. Our animation studio in Halifax has 65 employees. Because of this change, we expect that to more than double, over the next 18 months, to 150.”

Now, I'm not the best at this stuff, but from what I understand, reading their [2014 financials](http://www.dhxmedia.com/docs/investorrelations/Financials_and_MDA/DHX%20MEDIA%20UNAUDITED%20INTERIM%20FINANCIAL%20STATEMENTS.pdf), it appears they received 66 million in tax credits from provincial and federal tax credit programs. NOTE: Not all was received from the Nova Scotia tax credit program, however, other provinces are now competing with each other and may consider [reducing their programs](http://globalnews.ca/news/1897628/report-recommends-quebec-phase-out-filmtv-tax-credit/).

So, for these reasons I'm longterm bearish on DHX. Disclosure: I have not bought puts but I may consider it at the end of the month.",1

15-04-10,FITCH: BOND DEFAULTS A LONG-TERM POSITIVE FOR CHINA MARKET,"The default by Chinese computing firm Cloud  Live Technology on a CNY400m bond reflects an increasing tolerance for defaults in China's onshore corporate debt market. Fitch Ratings believes that allowing  for defaults is a long-term positive for the Chinese bond market, as it will enable investors to price risk more effectively and appropriately. 

The Cloud Live default is unlikely to have a major market impact in the short  term, being a relatively small company that was already under investigation by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. However, the event is significant as it is only the second default of an onshore publicly traded bond in China, and the first to default on its principal. 

Chaori Solar was the first company to default on an onshore bond when it failed to make a CNY89m interest payment in March 2014. Chaori's default ultimately resulted in a restructuring plan which saw state-owned asset-management companies provide guarantees on bond repayments. 

More defaults of this kind are likely. Government has expressed a greater willingness to allow for individual cases of corporate bond defaults, particularly for companies in non-strategic sectors where the default will not lead to systemic risks. 

Allowing for more defaults, and establishing a clear legal process for managing corporate bankruptcies, is essential to instilling greater market discipline - and ultimately for a more effective and appropriate pricing of risk. 

The lack of defaults in China's onshore bond market results in an inefficient allocation of capital and artificially inflated risk-free rate. Larger, state-owned companies in particular benefit from this environment because of a broader investor assumption of state support.

Thus far, though, there have been few examples to gauge how the government's position will be put into practice. Notably, China continues to lack clarity on the legal process for domestic bankruptcies and restructuring. The law governing bankruptcies remains embryonic and lacking in practical details, while more defaults could prompt greater progress on regulatory clarity. 

As such, the process to instill greater market discipline and more efficient allocation of capital will only take place over the long term. ",8

I guess no matter how smart you (think you) are, or how obvious a concept is, if you haven't been exposed to it formally, you could be blind to it.  Guess that is one point towards formal education.  

The concept for me was in-sample vs out-of-sample data for backtesting.   And custom/overfitting my model to match known data.  I thought that if i did any kind of fitting, it would be obvious but i now i realize how subtle it really could be when i look back.  

    For example.  
    * I started off every backtest with 100k.  (arbitrary) 
    * When measuring a rate of change, i used 12 days (  arbitrary )
    * Basically any arbitrary number you use to set up your pre test thing.  

The more i think about it, the more it feels like... If a model does anything other than buy and hold feels like custom fitting in sample data.

I'm an undergraduate student from Indonesia, and am writing my bachelor's thesis.

My hypothesis is this; it is an open secret that the Indonesian stock market is dominated by a handful of large players (banks and their subsidiary funds), so we small players must try to predict their objectives (usually by looking at charts and volumes) rather than analyzing fundamentals.

So the topic for my thesis is to prove this by taking some well-known valuation models and applying them to Indonesian stocks and see if the real returns match.

The problem is, I don't know much about these models (because I depend on charts) so no I ask you, can you give me some that you personally depend on ?

I've got some by skimming Investopedia and Wikipedia :

However, the acceleration in the rate of rouble appreciation over the past couple of weeks cannot be justified based on the development in oil prices and the general global financial environment.

Danske Bank expects rouble weakness to resume, driven by significantly higher Russian inflation than in the outside world, continued very weak growth and a desire on the part of the central bank to ease monetary policy. 

While it is clear that geopolitical risks seem to have eased and are much less of a market driver than in 2014, it could still be a potential source of rouble volatility ahead.

""Our forecasts for USD/RUB to 60, 65 and 70 in three, six and 12 months respectively. We recommend using the present strength of the rouble to hedge income in rouble"", says Danske Bank in report on Friday.

15-04-11,Allow Me To Explain Why Buying pumps is bad,"Buying pumps
-
A few days ago I made a post pretty much saying it is extremely reckless and fooling to buy THCZ (this was at the peak of the pump). Little did I know how much people disagreed with it. I really was shocked and explained myself saying that it is too unpredictable. I can understand why they didn't get what I mean because I might not have been specific enough. 

So refer back to this post anytime you are thinking about buying a pump. First off, and most important, you are getting in with no set ""risk"". When you buy in, there is absolutely nothing fueling the stock price going up other than newsletters. You are at mercy to eveyone else's emotion and profit taking ways. At any point (literally any second) the stock could snap and collapse, which it did. Now you might be saying ""oh well what is the difference with shorting, shouldn't that be the same""? Yup you are right if you are thinking this. You can refer to stocks like VLTC and GENE which are 2 short killers. However, shorting pump and dumps is generally a lot safer because there are a lot of sheep in the stock. 


**""What do you mean sheep?""**. Simple really, they get in the stock strictly because a newsletter told them to or because it is a ""hot pick"". These kinds of people are trading with such emotion that at any point if one group sells off, every does. 

And a common thing I get is: ""well you profit, so what is the big deal"". It isn't my money, but let me let you know on this: if you go into a casino and come out winning, will you always? No obviously not, and this is what I mean. It IS luck, there is very little strategical trading going on when you are buying a pump and dump and praying it will go up. 

**""Oh whats the difference between your trades and buying a pump?""**. Simple, I take a strategical approach based on solid evidence that a stock is going up/down. Saying a pump will go up from the point you buy it is like saying VLTC will go down when you short it. 


**""Why don't you just short it then?""**: most pumps are actually too cheap to short, the 2.50 rule would kill any chances to trade them. Honestly, you shouldn't short a sub-pennystock anyway (or buy one but that is a whole separate thing). If the stock is up in price and is a pump (not all pumps are newsletter based too) then I will short it. But not randomly, I will not get in thinking ""it has to pull back now"", I get in when it shows it can't break anymore.

**""You think you know everything, my trade wasn't luck""**. I hear this the most. My reply to that is: what happens if the trade began to turn when you got in? I mean it is a OTC pump, most promoters are out in the morning or midday. And also, I do not think I know everything. I just know that the success rate overtime of buying OTC pumps is insanely low. You have to have an ability to understand the right time to get in and out of these kinds of stocks. In case you guys do not know, most people on this subreddit do not tell you their losses. So obviously everyone is going to gain on THCZ, because almost everyone is a little liar. 

**""scalp pumps""** Again, it is just luck. You are basing your trade based on a little window where it is a 40-60 chance it will go up. Why 40-60? Because if you get in, emotions will play a factor and instantly put you at lower chances of holding a trade. You need to get in with a set risk, a plan, and a real strategy (no offense to you pumper buyers).

**""Well isn't this how it is with all stocks? Why does it being a pump matter?""**. Referring back to what I said about, you have a lot more ""sheep"" in the stock where one small jolt down could set off a chain reaction. It happens to a much greater effect on a pump and dump (hint: that is where the dump part comes from). Doesn't happen with pretty much any stocks but pumps.

In the end it is your money, I am not telling you what to do. I am just saying what I would avoid doing under all circumstances.

Rise in yield spread remains the major force driving the dollar despite recent fall in US treasury yields.

* ECB and BOJ asset purchase program continue to push yields down across Euro zone. Four largest economies in the Euro zone, Germany, France, Italy and Spain seeing their 10 year pushing towards negative territory.

* German yield are now in deep negative up to 7 years, 10 year is yielding 0.17% just shy of negative zone.

* Switzerland's yields are negative up to 10 years now.

* Japanese 10 year is trading around 0.35%.

* Yields in France is negative up to 4 years, 10 year is hovering around 0.46%.

* Italian 10 year is yielding just 1.26%.

* UK, which was supposed to hike rates this year, saw 10 year yield drop from 2.5% in June to 1.6% as of now.

In contrast to the above -

* Since February US treasuries have fallen from 0.73% victim to dovish comments from FOMC, however still provides better yield opportunity at current 0.55%. 10 year yield dropped from 2.24% in February, however still better at 1.96%.

Dollar will keep riding as favorite, as long as yield spread remains buoyant.

15-04-11,A Beginner’s Guide to a Minimalist Home,"My family has been on a journey towards minimalism and simplicity in many regards; financially, work-wise, and with our home.  With two kids (and the stuff that comes with them), this has been a challenge, but we have done a pretty good job.
We have gone through our home, one room at a time, and decluttered over the past few months.  What’s left is a pretty “streamlined” and simple home with nothing in it that we don’t need.  Since I believe that clutter actually takes up space in our heads as well as our physical space, I have found that a minimalist home has had a profound effect on my family’s life thus far.  Here’s how I did it:
How to Begin to Create a Minimalist Home
Although I numbered these, there are no “steps”, per se. You just have to decide that you are going to pare down as much as possible.  I don’t think I will ever quite “get there”, but here are some tips for anyone dabbling with the concept of minimalism:
Try one room at a time. It’s overwhelming to try and simplify an entire house at once. Focus on one room, and then “spread the wealth” to others.  I started with my bedroom; especially the closets. Use this room to inspire you to simplify the next room, and onward!
Start with furniture. The fewer pieces of furniture, the better, for the most part. Think of which furniture can be eliminated without sacrificing comfort. Is there a piece of furniture you don’t even use?  Consider removing it.
Only what you need. When looking at stuff in a room, ask yourself if each item is truly essential. If you can live without it, get rid of it. Try to strip the room down to its essentials — you can always add a few choice items beyond the essentials later.
Clear floors. Your floors should be completely clear. Once you’ve gotten your furniture down to the bare essentials, clear everything else on the floor — either donate it, trash it, or find a place for it out of sight.
Clear all surfaces. All flat surfaces should be clear as well.  This alone makes everything much more minimalist.
Clear your walls. Clear your walls except for one or two simple pieces of beautiful artwork or mirrors.
Store your stuff.  Store everything you need out of sight, in drawers and cabinets. Bookshelves can be used to store books, but not much else.  As you are storing stuff, this may be a good time to donate, sell or trash it!
Investigate simple window treatments. Bare windows, or simple, solid colored curtains, or simple, wooden blinds are good.
Subdued colors. Most of the room should be subtle colors – white is classic minimalist, but any solid colors that don’t stress the eyes is good.  Throwing a tiny splash of bright color to create accent in small places is fine, of course.
Edit and eliminate. After a couple of days, look at everything again.  Ask a friend to take an objective look at the room.  Most of the time you will find that there are things you can simplify even more.
Find a place for everything. In a minimalist house, there is a place for everything. Designate a spot for everything in your home…even the coffee maker!
Sit in the room and celebrate. Once you’ve simplified a room, sit and simply stare. Notice how peaceful the room is?  It’s really a wonderful feeling.
As I said, I am on a journey toward minimalism; I certainly have not arrived!  For instance, my dining room is the busiest place in our home.  With homework, toys, and work stuff, I am long way from a minimalist dining area!  My living room, however, is as simple as can be after I followed my own advice above.
Try one room at a time, and have fun simplifying your home!

15-04-10,New employee stock options being axed as company was just acquired by larger company. Company now offering less attractive option in lieu of acquisition.,"So I recently started a job where as a part of my offer, I have the option of buying stock in the company at an exercise price of the current market value. However the company was just bought by a larger company and is now in the ""quiet period"" before the company is actually fully absorbed. 

I have received an email from HR stating because of the transaction that I can no longer be granted said stock options in the company because they were being offered at an exercise price of the current market value which they apparently do not have any current valuation of the company. 

So I am told that if options had in fact been granted for me, the exercise price would have been the same or nearly the same as the transaction value, so there would be essentially no net value in any of the options. So basically I apparently wouldn't make any money.

So in lieu of that I am told that they are willing to offer a cash bonus in the generous amount which is something I won't disclose here but it's not as much as I hoped to gain with stock options. 

This bonus calculation is said to be higher in value than the stock option would have yielded, so employees in my situation would actually experience a better benefit. However I am confused how they determined the value of that without a current valuation of the company? 

I have not been at the job that long, so I don't think I really got the chance to even manage that aspect of my employment benefits. 

Its all contingent of course on the final transaction and my agreement to waive any claim to said companies options.  

What does this mean? Are they offering me money to just be nice because I missed the money train? I am kinda bummed out about that because I was looking forward to learning more about investment in this more hands on manner.  Anyway advise or insight on to what is exactly happening? Thanks!",1

There was pretty slim picking as to what funds they offered, so I'm putting the majority into a simple target retirement fund.  I recently checked in on my overall investments and noticed that the expense ratios in the 401k are higher than any in my Vanguard account.  The target retirement fund in my 401k has a expense ratio of 1.01% while a similar vanguard retirement fund is 0.18%.  I'm a novice when it comes to investing so I'm not sure if its just typical for 401k investments to have higher ratios. 

I was thinking of decreasing my input into my 401k and adding more to my Vanguard Roth IRA account. Would it not be better in the long term to put more of my money into the IRA with smaller expenses or to keep putting money into the 401k since I'm getting the company match to my contribution?  Or should I switch my 401k contributions into funds with a smaller ratio?

What I'm thinking of doing is gifting each of them $1,000 or so of dividend growth stocks. I want to buy a few conservative companies and just let them receive the dividends. I need it so they can spend the dividends. 

I'd like to set it up so the dividends go as directly to them as possible - ideally in a way that I don't have to do anything for them to get the money. I need them to see the dividends coming in and what companies they are coming from. At worst, I figured I could control the accounts, and send them cash or a check for the money, with a print off of the dividends paid by their companies. At best, they'd be able to see it on the computer and pull the money into a bank account or PayPal or something.

I'd prefer the stocks are in their names, but that isn't critical.

After a few months, I am not emotionless in each trade I make and am not effected by morons.

Here are a few tips I have developed overtime which hopefully can help you:
-

* Don't trade illiquid stocks

Simple, ignore them. They can move so fast and it is so hard to close out a position.

* Having a set risk on each trade

Literally required for me at this point. Have a mental stoploss around each trade made.

* Do not all in

Self explanatory

* **NEVER** follow trades just because other people are trading them

Simple, you follow them and have no idea where to get out. You screw yourself hard

* Understand how a trade should go before you get in, if it doesn't follow it get out

* last but not least, ignore idiots who are trying to tear you down.

15-04-11,How To Handle Your Emotions,"I went back and looked through my old posts for the hell of it to see how I acted. It turns out I was too quick to reply to morons. I have clearly developed some type of mental strength to ignore these idiots. Now at the same time, I was scared in each trade I went into. After a few months, I am not emotionless in each trade I make.

Here are a few tips I have developed overtime which hopefully can help you:
-

* Don't trade illiquid stocks

Simple, ignore them. They can move so fast and it is so hard to close out a position.

* Having a set risk on each trade

Literally required for me at this point. Have a mental stoploss around each trade made.

* Do not all in

Self explanatory

* **NEVER** follow trades just because other people are trading them

Simple, you follow them and have no idea where to get out. You screw yourself hard

* Understand how a trade should go before you get in, if it doesn't follow it get out

* last but not least, ignore idiots who are trying to tear you down.

This user has attacked me countless times, ignore them and continue to trade. If you feel there is advice to be given, then go ahead and comment.

15-04-11,Record keeping for mutual funds?,"Hi all, semi new to investing, I have a 401k and a roth IRA, and I am ready to start investing some of my savings.

I will be using Vanguard, I am in the process of moving my Roth from USAA to Vanguard, and to start I will be just using a target date retirement fund 2045. Since my withdrawals will be tax free, I have never kept a log of my activity, since I assumed there were no tax implications, but I do have all my old statements in shoeboxes lol.

Anyway, my main question is, Im going to start with about 10k into some vanguard mutual funds, and probably continue to throw another $500 a month into them.  Maybe as my confidence increases, I'll try individual stocks and such, but probably not this year.  

I have no real goal for this money, I have an comfortable enough emergency fund, so it might be an growth/next car/new roof type fund.  If I'm doing regular investing, and then in 5 years need $20,000 for a newer truck but continue investing at the same time (does that make sense?) how do I go back and figure out what my profit is? Or does Vanguard tell me all that?  I don't want to start this out and then in 5-10 years have a tax paperwork nightmare or end up paying more than I owe.

Sorry if this is such a noob question but I didn't see it covered in the wiki unless i missed something.

15-04-11,Zillow and their Stock Price (Part 2),"Last week, I had posted about Zillow and their stock price on how overvalued it was. http://dm.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/31kjbb/something_weird_is_going_on_with_zillows_stock/

Main points from the post/discussion were 

1. It is even an understatement to say the stock price is Zillow is overvalued. The stock was trading at 7 times book value, 20 times revenue, and over 100 times free cash flow

2. It brings into question, whether they have a flawed business model? They make their money predominantly by selling advertisements to these ""premier"" agents who pay a lot of money, but its strongly believed that they have ""maxed out"" and cannot get any more of these agents to pay money, so they have to raise the current price of ads and this is leading to many of agents already signed up to leave the program. 

3. The stock has been trending down from a high of 158 in July of 2014. The return on equity dropped from a high of 3.11% in 2012 to -2.94% in 2013. It dropped again to -7.54% in 2014. And most importantly while Zillow has been losing money for the past three years (and most recently 40 million in 2014), The key executives compensation has increased from a total of $2.2 million in 2011 to $8.9 million in 2012. The following year it increased to $15.2 million.


To make matters worse, since my post last week, Housing Wire has reported about several analyst fears about Zillow's stock 

http://www.housingwire.com/articles/33466-barclays-downgrades-zillow-on-market-saturation-fears

And last night, an anonymous whistleblower sent a letter to Zillow's main competitor, realtor.com explaining how Zillow scrapes Realtor.com’s listing data for the purposes of benchmarking its own listing count, how Zillow’s sales team scrapes lists of Realtor.com’s real estate agent customers for the purpose of calling them and pitching its own advertising products, and worst of all, the letter also accuses Curt Beardsley, a former realtor.com Exec who now serves as Zillow’s vice president of industry relations, of stealing a number of the companies' databases including its “private MLS contact database” and “listing count database,” which have allegedly been added to Zillow’s own databases. This is huge, and Richard Murdoch's company News Corp now owns realtor.com and he is not going to let this one slide. He has deep pockets and would go the extra mile to make sure Zillow is punished. This is pretty serious stuff, this is breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and misappropriation of trade secrets, acquiring data using improper means, and copying it without authorization. And its not as if some troll sent this letter, this is most probably a Zillow employee as it has pretty ""specific"" info such as ""Zillow is running secret programs called “LSS” and “LSSv2″ around listing quality"".

15-04-11,First options play NYSE:ZNH #highroller #cashmoney #tothemoon,"Made my first options play(s) this week.  I'm bored and realized that ""I want to learn about trading"" didn't mean ""buy blue chips and wait 10 years.""  Options it is!  (Note that I'm fully aware of the risks.  I'm financially stable and am playing with a small amount of money I do not care if it disappears tomorrow.  Still testing the waters and only making small &lt;$100 plays with no margin.)

One symbol I've been watching lately is ZNH (a Chinese airline).  Probably due to their latest earnings release or the price of oil or both, the stock price has been rocketing up day after day since the end of March.  NYSE:CEA is also following a similar trend.

https://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1428776621802&amp;chddm=8602&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NYSE:ZNH&amp;ntsp=0&amp;ei=pmYpVfHyE8j28AaD34HIBA

I noticed the trend around April 1 and wanted to make a $45 April 17 call, only problem being I didn't have an options account yet.  Fast forward a bunch of days, finally got level 2 and cleared funds available and the price flatlines at $40 for two days on April 2-6.  ""Oh good thing I wasn't a fucking idiot and bought that call.""

Next day the price jumps up another $3.  ""Well it's super overbought now, the trend broke briefly and it's probably about to experience a reversal.""  Also going back in ZNH history, the price has spiked up to similar levels but never stayed there for long.  Ordered a $35 May 15 put at some low price after hours, got filled in the morning at $0.55 WHEN THE STOCK FUCKING JUMPS $5 AGAIN TO $48.

Probably one of the few instances where being hasty would've made a lot of money.  April 9, the underlying flatlines again but bumps up midway through the day.  Bought a $55 April 17 call at $0.60 because fuck it.  April 10 the underlying jumps up another $2 and I sell to close at $1.17.  The contract price was higher when I initially tried selling, but the bid/ask spread was pretty large and I was having trouble filling the limit order down the middle.  The underlying started moving downwards so I just entered a market order and took what I could get.

Which after commission was a $40.50 PROFIT FUCK YEAH TAKE THAT WALL STREET.

Still holding onto the $35 put (which is down in value now) waiting for the underlying to drop like a fucking ton of bricks.  But with that second play my account is only down $2.75 total.

BRING IT ON.

15-04-12,Some advice on investing and financial freedom for 24 year old?,"I apologize for the novel. 

I want to learn investment techniques to benefit me and my future.  Right now I am 24 and a manager of my dad's medical facility (physical medicine/chiropractic).  I have a strong love for business in general, but not so much capping my pay by how much I do in services (Ex. being a doctor).  I'm not really sure I want to be involved with the medical field at all.  

I've been researching investing in divined yielding funds to start out.  That way I can start with a decent portfolio, have double the protection as well as strong stocks as my base.  At least this is what I have gathered so far reading and watching lectures.  I'm open to any ideas that counter this approach.

Anyone have any opinions or ideas as to where I should start allocating my savings?  Stock/Investment books to read? Mentors to follow? I want to learn everything.  Quite possibly will move to Austin soon to be around a more booming/innovative community. (Also a musician.  Toured for years since high school and lived in Austin before) I currently live in Little Rock.

Also: I do not have a college degree, but I love teaching myself.  Sure, college is important and I've thought about going into IT/Healthcare/Banking for a niche industry.  I love building and fixing computers as well as the healthcare knowledge I already have. This would take away from my portfolio building by investing in college, but it could also benefit my future.

*Looking to spread investment over 2 or 3 company shares (unless otherwise advised)

*Not seeking massive financial gain initially, assessing my profitability and deciding whether I should continue trading. (read 90% of new traders empty their accounts within the first 4 months) Really don't want to be one of those people.

*Forensic Chemistry Student - chunks of spare time

*Interested in Global Politics and economy


Questions
1) Is there a time interval or limit to trading stocks? For instance are there rules in place to stop someone buying in a company at market open and selling out at the end of the day or sooner? Do you recommend trading in this way?

2) Is £6000 an appropriate amount to begin with? Should I spread this over multiple stocks or concentrate on one?

3) The account i've selected (http://www.hl.co.uk/investment-services/fund-and-share-account   £12 a trade - no admin fees) As an experienced trader, do you see anything that does not suit my status?

15-04-12,"What the companies bond market tell you about these companies' share price?","Take the oil sector for example. 

Since oil prices fell, oil stocks have been hammered!

But some have been more hammered than others because they are either indebted, has high operational costs or simply has a lack of funds to carry on as a going concern. 

Take oil producer Afren as an example. The shares are trading at 3p (down from 130p a year ago, a fall of 98%). 
Looking at Afren’s bond price that trades at 40 and 50 cents on the Dollar, ones need to understand the implications it will have on the shareholders. 
Shareholders’ of oil companies should ‘pay attention’ to the bond prices of the business because bondholders have first claimed on the company’s assets if they struggle to meet interest payments!!
If, the same oil businesses go bust, the bondholders will get first pick of its assets, and these guys usually get everything, leaving shareholders to rue their losses. 

As bond prices fall, yields on the bonds are going higher, this means three things: 
1. The higher yield means the oil assets are becoming less profitable, and risk of default is high;
2. Credit rating agencies like S&amp;P and Fitch will translate ‘higher’ yield to mean higher risk, by ‘downgrading’ oil producers’ creditworthiness. 
A downgrade means: 
Restrict easy access to external borrowings to oil producers meaning new money borrowed is at a higher interest rate. 
3. Lower bond prices should signal to shareholders that something is not right in the oil business.  
P.S. In a low oil price environment, oil producers are powerless because they’re price-takers, not price-setters. 
You can find Afren’s bond price in Morningstar, by clicking here: 
http://quicktake.morningstar.com/stocknet/bonds.aspx?symbol=afr&amp;country=gbr.
For the bond price of other companies go to the website called http://cbonds.com/ (subscription is needed). 

I will also want to add if these businesses are to be saved than the bond/debt will need to convert to equity, this means heavy dilution to current shareholders!!
For example, if: 
Company R has 200m shares in issue at a share price of 50p/share. It has debts of £300m and is struggling to keep up with interest. 
The value of the debt has dropped by 50%, meaning the debt market is valuing it at £150m. 
First, the company is working for the debt holders (bondholders/banks) because the ‘debt’ portion of the capital is three times as large as the ‘equity’ portion of the capital. 
P.S. Usually a sign telling you it is very risky to invest in its shares. 
As the company agrees to reach an agreement with the bondholders to convert debt into shares at 80% of the face value of the debt, meaning bondholders accept a loss of 20%, as the debt is valued at £240m. 
Calculations
Equity is £100m; Debt is £240m. 
The company will need to issue more than 2.4 times the current share issue, or 480m extra shares are giving a total of 680m shares. 
In order to maintain £100m market capitalisation, the share price needs to fall. 
That fall works out as £100m divided by 680m shares = 14.7 pence per share. Given that the company can negotiate off 20% of the debt value, reducing £60m of liabilities, it would be slightly higher than 14.7 pence/share, let’s make it 16 pence/share. 

The shareholders will see its value dropped by 68%. 

P.S. In the real world, these companies’ shares would drop first in anticipation of a future share dilution!!

NasdaqOMX has apparently discussed the matter at some length, and has [this](http://www.nasdaqomx.com/transactions/indexes/indexesorindices/) to say on the subject.  TLDR, emphasis mine:

* ""Indices"" is used when referring to **mathematical, scientific and statistical** contexts. It is used to refer to numbers, symbols, and figures comparing a value to a standard. 
* ""Indexes"" is usually used in reference to **written documents**, such as bibliographical or citation listings.  
* You will likely see the words ""indexes"" and ""indices"" used interchangeably when **exchanges or financial news outlets** refer to more than one index, but ""indices"" has been more widely adopted in texts referring to stock related index.

Another school of thought says ""arrays have indices, databases have indexes"".  As a former software developer, I think I agree, but still ... hmmph.

[How Index Trading Increases Market Vulnerability](http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v68.n2.7)

&gt;From this finding, we can infer that the ability of investors to diversify risk by holding an otherwise well-diversified U.S. equity portfolio has markedly decreased in recent decades. As our research has demonstrated, U.S. equity portfolios have become less diversified in recent years; returns for all subsets have become more correlated, leaving no areas for investors to improve diversification and thus mitigate risk. Put another way, investors’ equity portfolios are increasingly moving in lockstep with swings in the overall market. All equity investing, indexed or otherwise, is thus plainly a more risky prospect for investors. ",102

Fundamentals look good. One concern is the number of shares held by funds dropped significantly from 11M in June 2013 to around 4M in Sept 2014. Currently 5.1M shares.

But if I invest in the EUR ETF, the ETF goes up by 10%, the USD goes up by 10%, I cash out and now have EUR 110, i.e. less than EUR 121.

15-04-13,Question about Leveraged ETFs,"So I've read that leveraged ETFs are generally bad because of the decay involved (i.e. if the underlying ETF goes from 100 to 90 to 100, the leveraged ETF will actually lose on this movement).

So my understanding is something like UWTI which a 3x long etf is mostly a daytrading tool (or for just a couple days, as opposed to buy and hold).

Here is where I get really confused -- today for instance I am looked at WTI and it is up over 3%. UWTI, which is 3x Long leveraged, is only up 1.72% on the day. I thought for time scales of one day that UWTI would pretty much be 3x WTI -- why is UWTI not up 9%?

It seems if leveraged ETFs have decay and can't even be counted on to amplify gains on a daily level, that they are pretty useless. What am I missing here?",6
15-04-13,"OK...I picked a stock and it's tanking. What do I do?","As a new trader, it is a euphoric feeling when you pick a stock and it flies. You click sell, and watch your account grow. Hell, even now when I make a good pick, I'll go check my balances a few times afterwards as a reward for my good research. Makes me feel like the Wolf of Boise, Idaho.

But sometimes, you pick wrong. You research a stock and it fits your criteria, and them BOOM! It tanks. What do you do? 

Most day trading gurus will tell you that you should bail and take a minimum loss and live to trade another day. This is what I will do 99% of the time. ""Your first loss is your best loss"" is what my mentor tells me. He is absolutely right. But there is also another strategy. I don't advocate using this often but sometimes, you just KNOW your research is correct. I have bailed on a stock only to see it do what I expected it to do the following day. If I had held on, I would not only not lost money, I would have made money. This is when your practice comes into play. I have told you on several occasions that practice makes perfect. If you have faith in your system, you can sometimes hold a stock for a day or two until it does what you expected it to do. Again, I do not do this often and with OTC stocks, this is a bad idea. A very bad idea. But if you have practiced your plan and have faith in your research, this is a tactic you can employ on occasion and still come out ahead.

Another variation of this technique is something that is almost counter to what your brain may tell you. Again, if you know your research is good, and the stock is tanking, buy more. That's right. Buy it again. I used this technique today. I purchased a stock on Friday and my internet crashed. By the time I had my system up and running, I lost over a thousand dollars. All because some idiot hit a pole on the highway. This morning, I purchased more and although I didn't make any money on the stock, I didn't lose any when I sold. 

The moral of this story is to practice until you can trust your system. ",8
15-04-13,Buying an investment property and renting your own residence,"When you buy your first property, generally, you buy your primary residence. This means that you can afford to buy a place where you work, which is often hard to do if you live in a high cost of living area and are at the very start of your career, and also that you should be pretty sure that you will spend the next few years in said place, because if real estate prices go down, or simply if you move just a year after you buy, between the closing costs, realtor fees and the cost of moving in, you may lose money.

Another idea would be instead to buy a rental, so you can get the benefits of getting on the property ladder while at the same time keep the flexibility of renting a property fit for your needs.

Why would you opt for a rental?
Well as I said above, the first thing that comes to mind is that your local property market may not be ideal for home ownership if priced are on the rise. The rent vs buy calculations may not lean towards buying in overpriced housing bubbles. But you live there, so you still need a place to stay. What better way to have someone pay your rent while you build up equity on the property they live in?

You may not make enough to buy a place in New York, but already have savings that would represent a hefty deposit in Kansas City. And the rent would bring a better return on your deposit than the 0.1% your cash is bringing right now.

If you are living with a significant other, and not ready to put both names on the deed, it allows you to keep your place together while you start investing on your own.

And if you are just starting your career, you should not get tied to a property when your next job could be 3,000 miles away.

By buying a rental, you could move pretty much anywhere without worrying about having to sell your home before doing so. That is what I did with my UK property. I lived there for less than a year (with roommates) before putting the whole place up for rent and moving to Morocco. Now, I am still a continent away, and on top of that have put six time zones between my property and myself. And you know what? It works out just fine.

My tenants each rent a bedroom on separate contracts, and when one is about to vacate, they interview potential tenants to find the new roommate. I take care of bills and include them in their rent so they don’t have to fight about splitting them equally. The only little bumps on the way are generally about cleaning habits of some of them, so I am thinking about raising the rents and including a weekly cleaner. Other than this, if the washing machine or the heater breaks, I just send a handyman and wire them the money.

So I wouldn’t be worried about having a property two hours drive away, if one ocean away is doable.

What I thought before I left was that the rent I would get from the bedroom I used to occupy, around $1,000, would basically cover my rental needs anywhere in the world. Yes, $1,000 is pretty expensive for a room, but that is under market price when said room is in an affluent suburb of London. I have only had one week vacancy in one of the rooms over the past 5 years.

In Guatemala, $1,000 happens to cover my entire living expenses and the salaries of two staff, because I paid cash for my house, but it would more than cover my rent of a three bed luxury condo in a great neighborhood of Guatemala City. Even in Europe, aside from London, Paris and a few overpriced capitals, I could get a comfy two bedroom and live on my own. And if I felt like going back to Paris for a while, $1,000 would still get me an independent, albeit smaller unit.

I really like that the money from rent can be allocated to my living expenses, just like the time my motorcycle insurance company paid for some advertising on my blogs, enough to cover two years of bike insurance. You get the idea, getting a fixed source of income gives you the freedom of using that same income to cover the same category of expense for your flexible life.

 

Where should you buy a property?
If you have a nomadic lifestyle like I do, the world is pretty much your oyster. And if your career could take you anywhere in the country, buying next to where you live now may not be buying where your next job will be, so once again, you could look at your whole state, or your whole country. Some ideas include

- A college town. Students rarely buy a place during their college years, and you have a constant influx of potential new tenants. I am in a college town and my prices deter the freshmen so usually I get the PhD students or the recent graduates working their first job. They are serious, and often have mum and dad behind, which is extra consolation.

- Your hometown. While you may not live there at the beginning of your career, you may aspire to come back once you settle down and start a family. Plus your parents could keep an eye on the property, send their trusted handyman to do maintenance or chase payments face to face for you. You don’t want to be a burden but it gives you some peace of mind to know there is still a family member nearby if things go sour. You are also able to make an educated decision about each neighborhood without too much research, as you lived there for years.

- The highest yielding market. A quick online search will tell you which markets offer the highest rent in your region of choice.

- The best house you can afford on a high down payment. Things may not always go the way you planned and your property may sit empty for a while, and having low repayments will make life much easier. You could look for a place that is affordable right now, and put a 30-50% deposit on it, so the rent is only a fraction of the repayments. That will also allow you to live on the surplus should you lose your job, to pay off the rest of the mortgage early as well, or to set aside a good chunk of money for future renovations.

- A duplex. When you live a nomadic lifestyle, you often want a base to come home to. Buying a duplex or a triplex allows you to have renters pay most of the housing costs while you still keep a small unit as your own to store your stuff and re-energize when you are tired of traveling. Plus they serve as free house sitters!",1

The labor market ios expected to have performed more closely in line with the longer-term trend in March and look for a gain of around 20k, equivalent to an annualized rate of 2.1%. 

Nevertheless, the year-on-year rate of employment growth would still slow to 1.1% from 1.3%. Given the high volatility of the series, any forecast of course comes with a high degree of uncertainty. 

""We see scope for the unemployment rate to tick lower given that it was very close to the rounding point in February (6.253%), and in the light of strong growth in the labour force in Q4 which we expect to have moderated in March. In other words, we expect a fractional decline in the participation rate (64.60% from 64.62%)"", Said Societe Generale in a report on Monday.

What are the pros and cons of buying a atm option that expires in may, vs an atm call that expires in January.....with the same strike price? This is assuming your expecting a big binary event to take place before April is over.

I don't completely understand the relationship between delta and the time decay element. Also, how does this relationship change if you compare the same strike prices and expiration dates of mar and jan respectively....when you opt to buy deep ITM calls instead for the high delta?

I like high delta, but lets say Im expecting a huge jump in XYZ stock on april 30th. Say i bought the may call that was deep itm and I was wrong its basically worth less than I paid for it unless its a huge turn around right?  Had I bought the january expiration, I would at least be insulated a little because of the time value....but how is that going to effect my profits assuming it does what I expect and skyrockets vs the March call?

I hope my question is articulate enough, but long story short......why buy a march call instead of a january call when your expecting a binary event at the end of april? Is there any situation where buying the Jan call is smarter? What about when its atm vs itm?",3

15-04-13,"Trend investing has been very successful over the years and resulted in phenomenal growth when the right trends are identified. Examples include the PC, rise of e commerce, the transition from traditional forms of advertising to modern forms etc. What do you guys think are the major future trends?","Trend investing has been very successful over the years. By this I mean investing in companies that benefit from trends that regardless of cyclical behaviour will experience growth in the future, due to changes in trends and consumer habits. If the trend is identified and then companies are found with a large enough market share and competitive advantage, the returns can be phenomenal. The argument for this is that even the best of managements and companies in the wrong industry or on the wrong side of consumer trends are powerless.

History has many famous examples of trends and changes in consumer habits, the rise of personal computer, the importance of the Internet in society, recently the rise of smartphones and apps, the rise of ecommerce, the transition from traditional forms of advertising to modern forms and the list goes on. These trends have resulted in outsized share price gains for various different companies including Microsoft, IBM, APPLE, Google, Intel, Qualcomm, Facebook just to name a few.
 
But what are often not considered are the implications these trends have on other more traditional industries. As investors may be reluctant to invest in industries that are directly influenced or trying to pick the company that will dominate that industry in the future. However, the reality is that even if you do not consider yourself a “growth investor” you still need to understand possible future trends. Why? Let us look at several examples, for example the affects of the rise of ecommerce on delivery companies. The affects of electric cars and more energy efficiency in our technology on oil companies. The affects of wearable technology that promote healthy lifestyles and monitoring of health on fast food companies. The affects of crypto currencies on banks and payment companies.

So guys as I hope I have explained trends are very important for the growth investor as well as the investor who may not consider himself a growth investor. 

What do you think are the future trends in our world?

**CHOP** is a sketchy Chinese company. It has 6 million float so be wary of float rotation. It really held the 2.75 mark. If the stock is unable to break it right away, I will go short risking off that mark. If the stock gaps up and parabolics above 2.75 mark, I will be looking to go short into the weakness (likely 3). Becareful of a bounce off of 2.50.



**VLTC** Has a very low float, so obviously beware of float rotation (this stock has been squeezing for a while now). Do not be shocked if this stock REALLY ramps up again if it breaks 7, I will not be shorting unless it takes an insane amount of volume in 7 and fails to breakout. This stock is also super choppy intraday. Only shorting parabolic moves. 



**ORMP** Is a sketchy Pharmaceutical company. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock  bounces off the 8.50 mark. IF the stock is unable to hold that mark however, I will go short risking off 8.50. I will only be shorting lower highs, adding into pops. 



**GBSN** has 2 million float.

It will depend on if it can break and hold the 4.50 mark. If it does I will go short risking off that mark. IF IT DOESN'T I will be looking to get short around the 4.75 - 5 mark when it shows weakness (obviously risking off the peak). I will be adding into pop ups.

15-04-14,$KING,"There was a post last night about someone buying $KING going into earnings and I immeditedly thought this guy was a fucking idiot, but then I remembered, when everyone thinks you are wrong, you are usually right. Soooo I did a little research.

&amp;nbsp;

$KING is a tech stock. One thing I know (believe) that rules tech stocks is market share. The market could give less of a fuck if you lose $100M a quarter, so long as your market share is growing. So I am going to do my analysis on this. But first, here is a quick summary of my Pros/Cons:

&amp;nbsp;

Pros:
-over 200 games;
-Candy Crush still pulling in that dough;
-Diversified across multiple platforms;
-lots of cash;


Cons:
-Candy crush is declining;
-Issued ‘special dividend;
-No ‘Big Hit Apps’ since Candy Crush;
-extremely Competitive Market;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


$King made its money from Candy Crush,

&amp;nbsp;

Candy crush stats:
In 2013, it was the most downloaded app in IOS history, surpassing 500 downloads since its launch in 2012, it even surpassed Farmville on Facebook as the most played app. Shit I even played it. They monetized it, made some money went public and badda bing here we are.

-The game is updated every two weeks to add more levels and to keep people coming back.

-According to their financial presentation found on their website, Candy crush netted some $1.3billion in-app purchases during 2014 (which is ridic). However, the app is experiencing significant decline in revenue from ~$430M in 4Q of 2013 to ~$263.8M in 2014. I want to stress that I don’t believe the stocks price reflects the money-making ability of the company as much as it does its ability to keep consumers engaged and continue to grow. Yet with falling revenue, one could speculate consumers are going elsewhere. I believe Candy Crush to be a Fad of late 2012 to 2013, and to be obsolete by the end of 2015.

-However in Q4 2013, Candy crush accounted for 88% of revenue for $KING and in Q4 2014… 45%. So the Company is finding other solutions. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Sooo what else does $KING have besides Candy Crush?
-They boast on their site that they have around 200 games in the app store,
they are constantly coming out with new apps, AlphaBetty and Paradise Bay are due to release soon, for example. Are these games going to be as successful as Candy Crush? I highly doubt it. Is that bad? IMO, no, as the Company has effectively diversified itself across multiple platforms and games, most offering in game purchases. However, this does not come cheap as they must continually update and innovate in order to keep consumers interested. Consistently innovating and succeeding is extremely hard and low key impossible (unless you are Apple) in the long run, so unless $KING can find another slam dunk App, it will not be able to sustain a market value of ~$5billion. For reference, Zynga IPO’d for $7billion.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Is $KING a short term play?
-Fucking shit… probably. I really do hate this stock and in no way is it a long term play because a company that has to constantly innovative won’t last. However, if $KING post earnings/market share growth that stock is shooting up to the mothafuckin moon. Again, Zynga peaked at a market cap of almost $17billion at one point.. lmao. So the question is, is there a chance its earnings have improved from Q4 when they had a (11%) yoy decline? This is where I have zero fucking idea so this is what I did:
Looked up 2015 top grossing apps (for games):


&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

* Spot 3 and 4 for IOS are candy crush (was #2 in 2014)
* spot 10 is farm heros Saga (#7 in 2014)
* Spot 19 is Pet Rescue Saga (#8 in 2014)
* Spot 20 is Bubble Witch 2 Saga (idk what it was in 2014 but not in top 10)

&amp;nbsp;
So essentially the stock has lost most of its market share IMO since 2014 and it should, by all fucking accounts, go south when it releases its god damn earnings. 
I’ll be short. Anyone else have an other opinions? Hopefully a long analysis?

Analysis

$QCOM - I felt that Jana made some good points and initiated position when share price was around 69.20 Monday. I'm expecting increased volatility in the next few days. Planning to sell on Thursday. (Deep down, I'm hoping that Jana retaliates with another public statement and soon.)

$MSFT - Disagreed with Goldman Sachs downgrade - too much emphasis on damage from changes in revenue source and lower expectations for quarter's EPS. The bear argument for years has been almost the exact opposite - not taking chances. Last time I checked, meeting estimated EPS came second to adjustments to future guidance. Placed bet on share price hit from Sachs report. Carrying through earnings.

15-04-14,"What are the risks of investing in EUR-denominated S&amp;P500 index fund with EUR cash? Or is it same risk/higher reward?","From my earlier post on this subreddit, I now understand that the fact that the euro is going down makes for a higher return in the VUSA (EUR) S&amp;amp;P500 index fund than in the VOO (USD) S&amp;amp;P500 index fund. Because indeed Vanguard invested Euros in a Dollar asset and therefore gets a return from the rising asset plus the rising dollar. Therefore VUSA is performing better than the index and better than VOO.

But as long as the Dollar is rising/Euro is falling, and as a Euro that has fallen does not rise again above the value/exchange rate at which I bought, am I right in thinking I will always have a better return than if I invested my Euro cash in USD denominated assets (eg VOO)?

What are the risks here, assuming that the Euro continues to decline?

EDIT: I actually just thought about this a little more and now think that in the end there is no difference between VOO and VUSA for me (except different commission fees). Indeed, with VUSA the Forex gain is already priced in, whereas I would only see the Forex gain with VOO when I cash out and convert my USD to EUR. Correct?",16

15-04-13,Why do people invest in airlines and professionals advocate such investments when the returns are almost always disappointing.,"In investing in common stocks there are many ways to skin a cat. However, there are similarities between successful strategies. The overwhelming similarity is that the stocks involved represent companies with a healthy market, which allows players within the market to make a favourable return as well as a growing market.

The airline industry is a very difficult one, history has told us. The returns of various publicly traded airlines have regularly greatly underperformed the various indices over decades. This is arguably attributed to the extreme competition, low single digit margins and the fact that air travel on the whole is very homogeneous, a flight with one airline is for most people very similar as within another airline. 

Lastly, the high capital cost of running and expanding airlines and the homogeneous services they provide prevent any airline from gaining a large market share, a competitive advantage and favourable pricing ability. Yet, when oil prices weaken many analysts will recommend such stocks as sound investments. My question is how does that make sense? Surely if you wouldn't want to own such a stock for say 5-10 years, then you wouldn't want to own it for 6 months? Just because a stock will in the short-term show of a lot of cash from a surprise factor. If that cash cannot be invested with favourable rates of return, then what is the value of that extra cash? 

Of coarse I may be wrong in my opinion about commercial airlines. What do you guys think?

15-04-14,Does the Price Increase in Home Improvement Stocks Equate with Profitable Companies and are the Stocks still a Good Value?,"
Home Improvement Retail Store Stocks have steadily soared in the past five years in six of the largest companies: Home Depot (66.5%), Lowes (63.8%), Sherwin-Williams (67.9%), Fastenal (37.5%), Tractor Supply Co (68.4%), and Lumber Liquidators (73.1%); wiping out the loss from the 2009 crash (percentages based on January 1 prices).  (http://aoiclub.com/?p=244)

BUT ARE THESE COMPANIES PROFITABLE AND EFFICIENT?

Yes, all six home improvement companies show strong five-year earnings per share and return on equity’s above 20%.  In addition, Fastenal, Tractor Supply Co, and Lumber Liquidators have debt to capitol ratios way below their industry averages. Home Depot, Lowes, and Sherwin-Williams debt to capitol ratios are in line, or higher than industry averages, which makes them slightly less desirable.  (http://aoiclub.com/?p=244)

ARE THESE STOCKS A GOOD VALUE?

Based on P/E, PEG and P/B values, it appears that only LL is currently undervalued; the other five stocks are overvalued. However, because they are all financially strong and efficient companies, with good dividend returns (with the exception of LL), they are certainly worth watching, particularly as the we continue to see an increase in privately-owned housing units authorized by building permits in the United States and potentially an upswing in new residential construction (U.S. Census).

WHAT MIGHT BE A GOOD PRICE TO PAY FOR THESE STOCKS?

In order to estimate a good price to pay for these home improvement stocks (in other words the actual or potential value of the stock), I used a calculation that makes the assumption that since similar industries tend to have similar P/E ratios,  a stock with a P/E ratio different from the industry average, might eventually realign with the industry average, which is where the potential or actual market value lies.

Results of this simple calculation indicate that Lumber Liquidator could be a great buy and Home Depot a good buy.  Lowes, Sherwin-Williams, Fastenal, and Tractor Supply Co all need to come down some to be considered a good value.  (http://aoiclub.com/?p=244)

15-04-14,Ideas on where to setup a 401k with my new employer (small startup)...,"I just started a new job with a small startup (i'm employee #4) and the owner is willing setup a 401k plan -- as part of my going to work for him.  He doesn't know much at all about setting this up and he's willing to take my input (LOW EXP RATIO!) on the matter.  The HR/Payroll company he uses for payroll is basically pushing for him to use a company (i'm sure partnered with the HR/Payroll company in some way).  We met with that adviser today and it basically comes down to my company paying nothing for the service -- however a yearly 1.48 exp ratio is taken off of all money invested in the plan, plus the expense ratio of the funds you'd actually be investing in!  Way to much if you ask me...I came from a large company that had a nice 401k through Fidelity and the index funds there were on the order of 0.08 exp ratio and no other expenses.  

I realize that if my employer were to setup his own through some other entity, it would most likely cost $2-3k  per year (i think) just to have the 401k -- and this type of plan would most likely result in less expenses on the investing side (lower exp ratios).  

Any creative ideas from fellow redditors on a way to get the benefit of low exp ratio index funds for a 401k (or other pre-tax option i'm not aware of) without breaking my employers back on having the plan?    

Other pertinent info:
* For now i would be the only on the plan, but i'm sure down the road other would join
* He's doing a 4% match
* i'm capable of maxing out my contributions yearly ($18k) -- which is why i REALLY don't like the idea of the yearly 1.48 exp ratio

I look forward to any ideas you guys might have to offer!

I've mostly stuck to selling vertical calls/puts and iron condors since I prefer to know what I stand to gain or lose on a given trade. I've been having a great go of it, and despite getting roasted by Tesla going crazy last week (whoops), I have somehow pulled in and secured just over 10% of my starting 'cash' ($500k) in a week. I have another 10% or so that I'm waiting to close out on Friday and lots of buying power to spare (earnings reports make me nervous).

I bought some BLDR stock last year, only a couple hundred dollars worth and sold it for a profit of $60 maybe two weeks afterwards.
Well, I still had an alert for that stock that told me yesterday that the stock jumped from $7 to $11 a share over night.

Here come the noob questions:
1) I understand the spike comes from the announcement that they purchased a competitor. What actually caused the increase though? Did they open at a higher price (can they even do that?) Or were a bunch of shares bought so quickly that the price went up? 

2) When I saw this news, I thought ""oh man $11 that's so high, people will sell and I'll purchase when the price drops rapidly"".. it's now up to $13 something, so I'm obviously wrong there haha. When good news like this happens for a company, does the upward trend normally hold for a while? Again, I was expecting everyone to sell at 11 to get their 40% gain.. but that didn't seem to happen.

15-04-14,DAL Delta Airlines Q1 2015 earnings preview,"Funny thing about the airlines is that about a couple weeks before they report earnings every quarter, they release a PR detailing the quarter's results: http://ir.delta.com/files/doc_downloads/investor%20updates/1Q15/Investor-Update-April-2-2015_v001_y59ioj.pdf This pretty much tells you everything you need to know to determine if they're going to beat or miss earnings estimates. 

Delta releases earnings tomorrow before market open. They're expected to earn 0.44 on a non-GAAP basis. Let's see how this stacks against what they previewed in the PR.

First let's look at Delta's Q1 revenues. Here's what we know:

- Q1 2014 Available Seat Miles (ASM) = 53904

- Q1 2014 Passenger Revenue / ASM (PRASM) = 0.1424

- Q1 2015 Comparable ASM = +5%

- Q1 2015 Comparable Passenger Revenue / ASM (PRASM) = -1.5%

- Q1 2015 Other Revenues = 1450

To calculate revenue, we take (2014 ASM) * (2015 Comparable ASM) * (2014 PRASM) * (2015 Comparable PRASM) + (2015 Other Revenues). Thus:

Total Revenue = (53904 * 1.05 * 0.1424 * 0.985) + 1450 = 9388 million

Now we factor in Delta's Q1 expenses and taxes to get their net income:

- Q1 2015 Non-GAAP Operating Margin = 8-9%

- Q1 2015 GAAP Operating Margin = 14-16%

- Q1 2015 Non-GAAP Non-Operating Expense = 235

- Q1 2015 GAAP Non-Operating Expense = 265

- Q1 2015 Tax rate = 38%

Net income = ((Total Revenue * Operating Margin) - Non-Operating Expense) * (1 - Tax Rate)

Non-GAAP Net income = ((9388 * 0.085) - 235) * (1 - 0.38) = 349 million

GAAP Net income = ((9388 * 0.15) - 265) * (1 - 0.38) = 709 million

Finally, divide by the number of diluted shares, 827 million, to get the earnings per share. The numbers I showed above were assuming the midpoint of the operating margin, but I'll show the low and high-end below as well.

Non-GAAP EPS (low) = 0.39

Non-GAAP EPS (mid) = 0.42

Non-GAAP EPS (high) = 0.46

GAAP EPS (low) = 0.79

GAAP EPS (mid) = 0.86

GAAP EPS (high) = 0.93

If you assume the mid-point of the Non-GAAP earnings, it looks like they are setting up for a slight earnings miss.

What does all of this tell us about the potential stock price reaction tomorrow? Not very much, unfortunately. Even if they miss, oil prices are still muted, which means they could still have great guidance for Q2 and rest of the year. In addition, Delta's stock has fallen considerably since their last earnings (48 -&gt; 42), so one could guess that the incremental sellers are more exhausted than the incremental buyers coming into tomorrow (not to say there couldn't be a ton of sellers still around).

15-04-14,What Fundamentals Affect Commodity Prices,"Good morning! Today Troy continues with the investing for beginners series. You can check the previous posts about What are stocks and how to value them, How does Currency Trading Work, How are Currencies Traded, Investing in Commodities

In the previous post I explained the basics of commodity investing. In this post, I’m going to explain exactly what fundamental factors affect commodity prices.

A Precursor
Commodity prices tend to rise and fall together, much like how stock prices rise and fall together. As the saying goes, “a rising tide lifts all boats”. If the entire U.S. economy is doing well, generally all stocks will go up. The fundamentals below impact all commodity prices.

Inflation
Inflation is a huge factor that can impact commodity prices. Thanks to the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, all commodities are officially listed in U.S. dollars. Here are two important terms that you need to know

Nominal value
Real value
The nominal value of a commodity is the “official price”. If gold per ounce is at $1300 right now, then the nominal value is $1300. If inflation is 100% (a hypothetical scenario), then the nominal value of gold will also increase by 100%, doubling to $2600 per ounce.

The real value of a commodity takes into account for inflation. Let’s assume that gold is at $1300 an ounce. If inflation increases by 100%, the nominal value will increase, but the real value is exactly the same. There’s just more U.S. dollars chasing after the same amount of gold in this world!

As investors, we only care about the nominal value. Thus, when inflation picks up, commodity prices soar across the board! This is what happened in Germany with hyperinflation in the 1930’s – a loaf of bread cost a bajillion Marks (Germany’s currency at the time) to buy. The real value didn’t change (a loaf of bread is still a loaf of bread), but the nominal value exploded.

This is what happened in the U.S. during the 1970s (although it wasn’t as severe as it was in Germany). U.S. inflation skyrocked (14% per year), and commodity price spiked in the 1970s. Gold went from $30 an ounce to $600 an ounce.

Right now, we are seeing the early phases of inflation where inflation will pick up but has not started yet. Ben Bernake (Chairman of the Federal Reserve) has a genius solution to America’s economic woes – print money! That’s essentially the name of the game for his consecutive rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE). Sooner or later, this money printing is going to catch up to him (or us American taxpayers, actually) with huge inflation. And what happens when inflation hits? Commodity prices skyrocket.

Increased Demand, Decreased Supply
There is a fixed amount of supply in this world – it’s not like we can manufacture gold (alchemy!) or copper. On the other hand, demand is increasing exponentially. Can you imagine if every person in the world lived the way us Americans did! Considering the amount of stuff we waste each year (that’s how my relatives from Europe put it), the world’s resources would be depleted in a heart beat.

With developing nations increasing their standards of living, the world’s demand for raw materials such as oil and copper is outstripping supply. The Chinese are a huge buying force in the world – they are rebuilding their country after:

1800s: Britain literally robs China of all its gold and silver by drugging the entire nation with Opium (prior to the 1800s, drugs didn’t exist in China). It’s called The Century of Humiliation. China went from #1 in the world (literally, the “Middle Kingdom”) to dead last.
Early 1900s: Chinese Civil War
1950 – 1978: the Communist fiasco (Chairman Mao ruined China).
So really, China’s literally been rebuilding its entire country over the past 30 years. And because China is so big (both geographically and population wise), China consumes a ton of resources.

This trend in increasing demand and shrinking supply is only going to continue, thereby pushing up commodity prices. Factor in some more inflation thanks to King Bernake from the Federal Reserve, and you have the perfect set up for a long term bull market in commodities.

Thanks for reading! As I side note, I have something for y’all bloggers out there (and no, this is not an ad or a promotional gimmick). I’m trying out a new blogging software called Ghost for my site TradingSlugger.com. I like Ghost so much that I built a blog all about Ghost for beginners.

15-04-15,When does Buy and Hold not Work,"Buy and hold is the most common investment strategy out there. But you know what the problem is? Most people are doing it wrong! The part about “buy and hold” that Warren Buffett isn’t telling you is exactly what you should know if you do decide to buy and hold! In this post, I’m going to explain when “buy and hold” does not work. In the next post, I’ll show you how to make buy and hold work using an unconventional method.

Buy and hold is based upon a simple indestructible belief – over a long, long period of time (in a galaxy far, far away :P ), markets go up. Therefore, the savvy investor buys whatever investment he wants to buy, holds it for 40 years, and when he retires, he’ll be a bajillionaire! Warren Buffett said this, so he must be right! Don’t bet against America!

All jokes aside, Warren Buffett (and all those other politically-tied yahoos out there) are putting you out of the loop. You’re missing out on some key information here!

Fact Check #1: Markets Don’t Always go Up
The buy and holder’s basic belief rests on this – over the past 60 years, the average compounded return for the Dow Jones is 7% a year. Extrapolating into the future, the market will (over the long term) always deliver 7% a year.

As my grandpa liked to say “Na ah guys. Y’all getting it wrong.” These past 60 years in America (and much of the West) have been an era of unprecedented economic prosperity. You simply cannot extrapolate America’s Golden Age infinitely into the future. It’s like the 2nd century Romans saying that Roman engineering would always increase at 8% a year forever and ever. If that had happened, we would not have had the Dark Ages. This period of unprecedented economic growth (and stock market growth) is about to end – too many factors do not support such a historical anomally.

1. Rising raw material prices. When commodity prices rise, companies and their stock prices get hurt.
2. Technological bottleneck. Technology does not always advance at the same steady pace year after year. There can be decades without any significant technological breakthroughs, and then massive breakthroughs all of a sudden (eg the 1980s and 1990s). Over the past 10 years, nothing game-changing has really come out (and no, nanotechnology is not quite there yet). According to industry experts, “only improvements have been made”. iPads get thinner and thinner. The iPhone is really just an iPod with cellular capabilities.

If you look at other markets besides the stock market, things get even more depressing. If you “buy and hold gold” since 1980, you would have made a grand total of 40% over these 33 years. That’s less than what U.S. 30 year Treasury bonds are paying out!
So the “markets always go up” is actually a misnomer. It should be “the stock market always goes up, but cannot guarantee an average of 7% per year”.

Assuming You’ll Live 40 Years
Buy and hold assumes that you are actually able to “hold”. But what if (God forbid) you drop dead from a heart attack when you’re 53? After saving up all the money and reinvesting it into the stock market you die from a disease, wouldn’t your “buy and hold dreams” just have been wasted?
The conventional idea behind buy and hold is actually just another name for Get Rich Slow. Get Rich Slow is practically synonymous with Get Rich Old. Here’s why that’s not something you should bank on.

Assuming No Financial Disasters Happen in 40 Years
In order to buy and hold &amp; get rich old, you need to make assumptions. You have to assume that your plan will work out to the letter, because the one thing that “buy and hold” cannot withstand is a surprise. And we all know that the weirdest and most improbably things can happen. An event like the 2008 market crash should have happened like once in 9 million years. Well it happened in our lifetime. Buy and hold assumes that you won’t face any financial difficulties.
What if you lost your job in a recession? The stock market has cratered by 50%, but to make ends meet at home, you’re forced to sell your investment portfolio at whatever price you can get (which is usually the lowest price).
For Warren Buffett, buy and hold is easy. Even if his wallet takes a 99% hit (mayday, mayday), he’ll still have $500 million left. If you lose your job, you’ll probably be forced to sell whatever you own just to put food on the table.",1

The TSX has been on a bull run up until today. 

Speculation: The TSX crash and will consider buying HXD. However there is always the possibility that it will continue to climb, possibly to its last high which was 2014 Sept.

Consideration: I'm pretty a much a newb to economics, your probably wondering why I'm in the stock market in the first place... Anyway it boggles me why oil price is on the rise in which I asked on /r/Economics and the only reply was demand was slowly on the rise, granted so it will crash once supply reaches capacity? With the TSX going up that must mean the Canadian economy is doing good? As far as I heard from the regular news it doesn't add up from my general perspective. 

TDLR/Conclusion: 
* Buy HXD
* TSX crashes
* Sell HXD
* Profit

15-04-15,Opinions on Loyal3,"For any one who doesn't know, Loyal3 is a fee free stock trader. You also don't have to buy full shares. You trade by dollar value. Buy $10 of stock A at $7.50/share, get 1.33 stocks of A. It also gives the possibility of getting into a stock's IPO, not all IPOs however. Only select ones that agree to release IPO shares on Loyal3.  There are some downsides. Loyal3 only offers about 50 or so stocks you can trade. Big names like Disney, Nike, and Microsoft. Very good long term plays and almost no opportunity for day trades, especially since they only process transactions once a day. Put in a trade at 10am, trade goes through at 2pm eastern time. Again, this site seems more aimed towards long term investing. With this in mind and the fact you can trade with as little as $10, it's a very good way for beginners to get into real money trading. 

With all this being said: What are your opinions on Loyal3? Like it? Love it? Think it's stupid? What stocks do you like the best?",2

Can anyone tell me is it worth it to trade in my GWPRF and buy GWPH,  or is there any problem with holding GWPRF until I am ready to cash out?  Am I leaving money on the table, or am I smart to sit with what I have?

honestly am confused,  I bought GWPRF at 1.00 just because, and now have a nice little chunk of change sitting there.  want to get the most out of the situation.

15-04-15,BoC may remain open to cutting rates further,"The data has been relatively resilient lately, and the BoC will want to wait for more evidence the economy is weakening further before cutting rates again. 

The March jobs report was better than expected even if the details were soft. March housing starts rebounded sharply, even if the underlying trend remains fragile. The BoC quarterly business survey fell, but remained above 2012 lows. Q4 growth was decent, although January's data showed some fragility. 

Recent speeches show that the BoC expects some tailwinds from US growth. It also expects a boost to consumer spending from lower oil prices. The BoC may be disappointed with the magnitude of these tailwinds. Falling oil prices, and the likely sizeable drag on energy related investment are headwinds to Canada's growth.

**VLTC** Is trading very similar to how GENE traded back in its runup. It is only harder. I wouldn't touch this stock AT ALL unless it starts to hold up around the 8 area. Give it time and patience and this stock will collapse just like GENE. I think it will start to shift in trend within the next week. I have to trade this stock reactively too, no detailed plan.

**AMCN** will depend highly if it can break the 3.90 - 4 area. If the stock is unable to break 3.9 or 4, I will go short risking off that mark. IF the stock begins to parabolic above 4 without holding, I will be looking for a lower high and weakness to short (risking off the HOD). Shorting both the back side and parabolic moves.

**NVGN** Is Starting to get ahead of itself. I think one of 2 thing will happen. 1. The stock will test 7.50 and fail to break and hold. 2. The stock gaps up and parabolics over 7.50 and will hold up at ideally 7.70 - 8 range. Either way will be shorting parabolic moves, strong ability to hold 7.5, and the back side of the move.

**THCZ** has so many suckers in it. There are many people that are hyping this stock up thinking that it will be the next big thing. I am shorting this stock for the longterm (about 3-6 months) because the company is being completely fueled by hype. Good luck buying this stock. 



Just for fun I am going to watch HNR, not going to touch it though.

Fueling the rise in Petrobras shares: Brazil's federal police arrested João Vaccari Neto, the treasurer of Brazil's Workers' Party. He is accused of receiving ""irregular donations"" for the party, as part of an alleged bribery scheme involving inflated prices for contracts between Petrobras and construction firms. A related news conference is planned later today, Dow Jones Newswires report.  President Dilma Rousseff, who has denied knowledge of the scandal during her time leading the Petrobras board, is with the Worker's Party. Brazilians have taken to the streets protesting against corruption. Vaccari recently testified before a congressional committee that donations were legal and approved by the country's electoral court. He said similar donations were made to many other political parties. The investigation continues, and also involves dozens of politicians.  Petroleo Brasileiro ( PBR) said late Monday that it plans to release audited 2014 results April 22; Bank of America/Merrill Lynch upgraded Petroleo Brasileiro from Neutral to Buy on Tuesday.  In comments on its model Brazil portfolio, which includes Petrobras, Citi Research today reiterated its $7.90 price target per U.S.-traded share. 

Citi added the stock to the portfolio in mid-November of 2014, at $9.70. The stock is up 16% year to date, but has tumbled 36% lower over the past 12 months.

Inspired by the material, I learned the importance of passive income to achieve financial independence. Upon finishing the book, I decided real estate would be my path to get there. My plan was to build enough cash to eventually buy and hold properties for cash flow. Little did I know what lay ahead — the road was bumpy and I was not prepared for what came next.

Let me know if you would like to guest post on RFI!

The Early Years

In the beginning, I found deals for other investors. Being that I had a background as a business-to-business sales executive for a Fortune 500 company, finding opportunities and negotiating contracts came naturally. During one of my earliest deals, I made a whole year’s salary. It was amazing! I continued to build up cash until I eventually started to buy and hold single-family homes for cash flow.

 

Life as a landlord.

Upon building up my cash reserves, I was able to acquire a small portfolio of rental properties. Though, I have to be honest – life as a landlord was not the rosy picture I imagined. What I thought would be a walk in the park turned out to be a nightmare. I became overwhelmed by the sheer administrative side of the real estate business. There was always something to be fixed; I would always receive phone calls sometimes even late at night. At one point, I went ahead and hired property managers. Though, I still had to manage the managers. Life was miserable.

 

An eviction leads me to the tipping point.

Years later, I was a burned-out landlord constantly dealing with the hassles of landlording. I was going through an eviction which took eight months and involved going through the court system. I even brought in a property management company to help with the eviction case. On the day of the eviction, my property manager called me telling me my renters wanted to make payment arrangements for the past due rent. I told him no arrangements, I just wanted to get this over and done with. So the eviction continued. Once the eviction was over, I made the decision that I was through with landlording and decided to cash out on my entire real estate portfolio.

 

The course that changed my life.

As I contemplated my future, my attention turned towards my bookshelf. There were countless real estate books and courses on every subject you can think of. Though, one course stood out to me — a little green one. I picked it up and dusted it. It was a course (now a book) on mobile home investing, “Deals on Wheels,” by Lonnie Scruggs. I began to read it. This course sat on my shelf for five years before I did anything with it.

 

With experience, my perspective changed.

After I read the course, I knew now what I had to do. Life was not only about making money; it was about being free from money. Sure, I had read this before in Kiyosaki’s book. Though, it was only through experience that I could see now what I did not see before. At this point, I made the decision to learn the ins and outs of mobile home investing to achieve a life where I could do the things I want to do, not have to do. And, the rest is history.

 

Life as a mobile home investor.

At first, things were hectic. I made many mistakes. Though, I learned along the way. With each deal and property I acquired came a stream of cash flow that lasted for years. No longer was I tied to the restraints of money. I bought every home entirely with cash owning them all free and clear so I did not have a mortgage looming over my head. Giving prospective residents an opportunity to call a place their own is much more fulfilling. Choosing residents for the homes was a learning experience. I made some bad decisions but some good ones as well. I learned what I had to do to free up my most valuable asset: my time.

Nowadays, life is much slower. I have the time to do the things I want to do, not have to do. I can breathe and take the time to enjoy life. I like what I do. Through mobile home investing, I have found a sense of community with the residents and neighborhoods I work in. Business is done the old-fashioned way with a smile and a firm handshake. Since I work with people with a homeowner mentality, no longer do I get disturbed on a regular basis. Sure, I get calls every once in a while to put out a fire or two. But, it’s rare.

Sometimes life can throw you a curve ball. One day you think your life is going one way when all of a sudden you’re going in another. Clearly, this was not my chosen path. But, it was the one that worked for me.",1

Yet investors appear ready to value this company at as much as $36 billion, nearly 200 times trailing earnings! Google with the same market cap of McDonald's (a stock I own)?! HA!

The part that caught my eye was this section *I do a pretty active tax management of those assets, so in 2013 and 2014, we paid $0 tax while also converting about $20,000 a year to our Roth IRA to make that money tax-free forever*

They are living off $40k a year, transferring to a Roth, and not paying taxes. He links to his blog post which shows his [tax return](http://www.gocurrycracker.com/go-curry-cracker-2014-taxes/). Basically, because they complete the Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet, they are married filing jointly, they can have $73,800 tax-free(?). 

He further goes on to explain the Roth conversion. 

This is fascinating to me. I've been spending a lot of time on this forum, reading the posts, and people are always noting to be cautious of taxes you'd have to pay when selling, yet, he seems to be making it work for him.",461

Useful info, barely have any use for them nowadays:
-

* Trade former runners

* Gap up and run over whole/half dollar mark or run up and peak at whole and half dollar mark for parabolic stocks

* Float rotation- let it pick a trend, and either: buy dips on uptrend or short pops on down trend, don't 50-50 on line in sand 

* Down move with heavy volume on back side of trade means potential collapse

* For potential breakouts after 3:30, look to buy dips

* Short pops instead of weakness on ssr

* Use aprox. 30-50% of equity in trades

* 1m shares or more preferred for finding good shorts, less could be good for longs 

* Focus whole and half dollar marks

* Fails to break resistance can be shown as weak and fall

* ABCD pattern on multiple time frames

* ABCD Use b as set risk (b is low of day)

* Remember bounce plays, stock spikes down, lots of panic, buy into the low and wait for people to cover their orders and the stock will rise

* Avoid 10:30 to 12:00 unless breaking previous highs

* Do not buy penny stock bounces 

* Anticipate stop losses for both short sellers and long sellers

* Avoid shorting on fridays, risky

* Pre market can determine if price goes up/down

* Don't short quickly

* Under short sell restriction, don't short fades until it cracks base

* Short on green to red at end of day

* Look for squeezes at the end of the day on strong stocks

* Desperate companies offer stock at discount prices

* Catalyst for breakout works well, or a lot of volume

* Avoid over extended breakouts

* Ffv= industry average p.e ratio x forward earnings estimates

* Repeated failed breakouts are bad

* Gap play, look for stocks near or at highs, up a lot, good intraday, and has a good 30-60 end to the day, also not too much volume

* Washout when there is a weak close 

* Extreme Lateday after hours trading shows interest in a stock which will most likely bring it up (example: trades at 7:50pm)",8

I am a woman in my early 30s that have been wanting to trade since my early 20s but has always being hesitant. I was told that it was a bad idea and I have been told the same by A LOT of people. But anyway, my question is, Is it that bad? I decided that life is too short and if I die tomorrow I think not trying the stock markets would be one of my regrets.
Anyway, So far for what I have read, it seems that day trading is only for people with money. I mean if I consider the minimum to trade $25000 + broker fees etc... I have been playing two games in the Market watch website. One of the games I invested $10,000 and on game 2 I invested $100,000 and my conclusion was that it is only worth it if you invest a large amount of money that of course with my income would be impossible to obtain.
I was thinking about buying small quantities of stocks directly from the companies every month and let it accumulate through the years. I mean I rather buy a stock than a pair of shoes really :) but I don't know if it is even worth it.
Anyway, Is there a way to get out of poverty trading? Is there something that I am not seeing? because so far it looks to me that it is impossible.",0

For your holdings, if one surpasses your expectations/target return, or if the company's situation or fundamentals change, at what point do lock in your gains and sell? When would you 'trim' a position? Does that change if you don't have opportunities waiting to put that money to work?

An example for me which is prompting me to think about this is Cigna Corp. Got in about a year ago, averaged down a bit in October, and am up about 50% on the stock. I base a lot of my investment decisions on data from an EVA-based model to which I have access. I see Cigna as demonstrably less attractive today than a year ago (not just value wise, it's performance over the last 2 quarters). I wouldn't buy Cigna at $130 with the info I have today.

It had gone straight to pay off debt (not student loans, actually my mom's credit card but that's another story). She didn't claim it on her taxes.  
  
I'm wondering why it wouldn't be *income*. I didn't make enough last year to even file, so I wasn't going to since I was exempt. Anyone know why he'd say that, in the manner he did?  
  
Everything I've looked at online, and gone  through with filing wise resulted in that as income. So I figured I need to file with an accountant but figured it wouldn't hurt to ask some people who might be familiar with it. Thanks.

There are definitely better times to start investing than others. Look at a 20 year chart. The market goes through a recession/correction about every 7 years. That's when you should go in. 

Edit: ok so clearly you guys disagree with me. 

I personally believe that the market is ALL about timing. The smart guys go in after the recession not at the top. Do you seriously think professional investors just put their money in randomly because oh gee ya can't time the market. 

Edit again: if you really believe you can't time the market then have fun waiting 40 years for some actual returns. Your beliefs will ruin you. Buy low sell high. It's so simple yet so few really live by it. But I guess the markets are just so confusing and random that it's better to just not use your head and randomly throw money at the market and just pray it continues to go up

Edit again again: and do you really think this bull market is going to last forever? China is slowing down. Europe is in a shit hole. The United States will be ending qe soon. Student loan debt is through the roof. Income inequality is as rampant as ever. Do you really think they solved the problems from the 2008 crisis? Watch inside job. All the same people are in power again. You know the banks need to be doing something fishy if they're making this much money. There is a massive correction coming soon. Have cash ready to invest at the bottom to truly buy low and sell high. 

Peace out

15-04-15,Interesting paragraph from the EMH section of CFA L3 material,"&gt;For example, Fama et al. (1969) study the stock market reaction to stock splits. The study finds that the market begins to anticipate a stock split more than two years before it actually happens and incorporates the consequences of the split the day it is announced. As may be seen in Exhibit 6, stock prices are shown to rise pre-split. This price action is a matter of some debate because stock splits do not technically add any value to a company. Fama et al. find that 72 percent of firms in their sample announced above-average dividend increases in the year after the split and proposed that stock splits signaled that dividend increases were on the horizon. On average, they find that stocks increased sharply prior to the split, but returns after the split were very stable. These results indicate that the implications of a stock split appear to be reflected in price immediately following the announcement of the split and not the event itself. This research supports the semi-strong form of market efficiency, because investors would not earn abnormal returns after the stock split information is publicly available.

Author is Michael M. Pompian, CFA and this was taken from Volume 2 of the CFA Level III text, page 15.",13

Alcoa-  They really seem to have gotten their act together.   They have diversified and reformed to a less volatile company that should be less impacted by AL price fluctuations.  I am impressed that they have held the line on low dividends because that tells me that they are building for the long haul.   Plus when they do raise dividends watch out!   Plus how great is it to pick up a big name for $13 dollars a share.

Sea World-  Just got a new CEO with a track record for success.   On top of that all amusement companies should do well this summer with the low gas prices.  If your are concerned about the Orca issues, remember they own 11 parks and only three have Whales

Tetra Tech Inc-  They are an engineering company involved in drinking waste water and recycling water (and environmental issues).   They are winning one federal contract after another lately.  On top of that the drought and future water shortage will make their expertise on this subject invaluable.   

Spectra Energy Corp-  Big into natural gas.  I like that they transport it as that means that they will make money even with gas prices down (don't forget when gas is cheap utilities tend to go NG over coal).   Solid company with a nice economic moat. ",14

Preface by saying that so far I've put in $150 and it is now $166. I don't own any stock at the moment because I cash out everyday

Because it's free of commission, I can just buy low and sell after even the slightest gain. My strategy is going to be simply having a higher amount of money available so that I can sell at the peak and buy back in at the valley. Rotating stacks of $150 at a time because the money takes a few days to become available after you sell. 

For a lot of you this is laughable, such a small number. But for me this is exciting. Even making $00.24 after selling 3 shares of some unknown company is a gain in my opinion. Robinhood gives me the power to get a free lunch every now and then. ",3

And while rates will undoubtedly rise again at some point, guaranteed instruments will never outpace inflation. This creates a dilemma for many investors who seek a decent return on their money, but don’t want to risk losing their principal. However, there are several investment options paying higher rates of interest than CDs and treasury securities with a very reasonable amount of risk. Those who are willing to explore some of these options can significantly increase their investment income without having to lie awake at night worrying whether their money will still be there in the morning. Low risk investments can be a perfect investment solution if you want to make use of your savings without endangering your capital. Low can come in many forms, from a savings account to saving certificates and bonds. As there is little or no investment risk to your savings (other than potentially the risk of inflation eroding the value of your capital’s purchasing power or the institution collapsing), the interest rates you will receive will be lower than what you would expect if there was an element of risk involved. For those who are willing to take some risk with their savings, it may be worth considering something which has a higher in order to maximise your investment returns.

15-04-16,Does your financial advisor outperform the market in good and bad times for you?,"According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, nearly 75 million households pay for financial advisory services. It would be wise to question the added value that advisory services provide, especially after their fees. Does your financial advisor outperform the market in good and bad times for you?

15-04-16,Starting an investment account.,"Hi Reddit,

I just finished college an am starting my career. I'm interested in developing an investment account that is of the ""set it, and forget it"" model. In the past, I worked for a company that was tied into the state retirement plan. I never worked long enough to become vested, but I contributed about 6k to a Roth IRA and about 3.5k to a 401k. My current  employer does not match 401k. I'm considering just rolling the 401k into my Roth and simply making monthly contributions for...ever? Anyway, the state seems to think the best idea is for me to let them hold my money and just contribute. I'm wondering if it would be in my best interest to find a new company to work with. The state doesn't seem to have much in the way of approachable advice for any investment questions unless I'm an employee of the state. I feel that I may have a more personalized experience (and a better opportunity to make good financial moves) if I were to use another company. Just looking for some advice. I know little about investing or stocks- I just have the desire and discipline to save money for the future. I can clarify if needed. Thanks.",1

AA caught my eye a year ago after their CEO was on mad money. Recently, Cramer (bring on the down votes) gave a really stellar review of the company and it's outlook going forward. Apparently AA has diversified it's product assortment from commodity products to high margin proprietary ones. Additionally, AA is set to acquire RTI International Metals to help AA diversify it's portfolio into titanium and other aerospace products. 

Here is the article on CNBC discussion Alcoa.

I'm going to do some more research, but I'm interested it sounds like a company that is diversifying their product assortment into aerospace and automobile, custom aluminum products, truck wheels that are more efficient, and more. 

AA Has been one of the most active stocks in terms of volume on the NYSE this week. 

What say you r/investing? Is this just more of Cramer's smoke? Or should I give serious consideration into taking a position in AA?

15-04-16,Lessons Learned - Confessions Of A Financial Adviser,"Here is a quite good article about common investment pitfalls:

http://seekingalpha.com/article/3074646-lessons-learned-confessions-of-a-financial-adviser

Much of this advice is not novel. But it is a very good one article overview of common problems. It is definitely worth a read, both as a reminder and to keep on file as an article to send to friends who are getting more active with their investments.

Some points that stood out to me:

&gt; Hand in hand with knowing what you own is to know why you own it. I've had clients buy AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) for example, because of its outsized dividend. They say they like the stability of the share price and want to collect the income. But when a disappointing quarter comes and the stock price drops a bit, they panic and sell the stock for a loss. They said they owned the stock for income but the dividend was quickly forgotten when the share price dropped a few points. Similarly I've seen people who hold income securities like preferred stock funds quickly sell out when the market hiccups a bit. They forgot what they were owning (income SECURITIES, not super high yielding CDs) and they forgot why they were owning them (regular monthly or quarterly income, not growth). One of the most glaring examples of this was when I saw people panic-sell investments in the Exchange Traded Fund (NYSEARCA:GTAA) because it was a large position in their account and they wanted to be ""more diversified"". The fund, at the time, was a fund of funds and held positions in about 80 other ETFs in virtually every publicly traded asset class in the market. Those who did not like the performance of the fund were likely interested in becoming less diversified. Some of the worst investing decisions are made when people don't understand the investment they have made.

I made that mistake early on in investing. Sold a bunch of stock back in 2008 when the market was going down, and I realized that I didn't understand any of what I was holding. Had I had a consistent thesis, I could have held strong. On the plus, side, I quickly realized mistake and reinvested my funds when the stocks were still at their lowest price range.

&gt; Do not ever assume the dividend is ""safe"". I've seen more investors get burned on this mistake than perhaps any other investing mistake. Inexperienced investors looking for yield will often do a quick screen on Morningstar or Yahoo Finance and turn up a list of stocks that are paying double digit yields that seem too good to be true. Perhaps management has even recently reaffirmed their intentions to pay the high dividend even though the payout ratio exceeds available cash from operations. Almost invariably the dividend will eventually get cut and with the cut the price of the stock will get slashed. Know how to determine if your dividend is likely safe. Is it paid based on GAAP earnings (like in the case of a C-Corp)? Or is it based largely on Funds from Operations (like in the case of a REIT). Perhaps it is based on Net Investment Income (like in the case of a Business Development company). Maybe the high yield is because the investment is self-liquidating (like in the case of many royalty trusts). In any event, companies that pay out more than their available cash rarely continue to do so for any length of time. Know that when the dividend gets cut, the value of your investment usually gets cut with it. And know that management rarely telegraphs a dividend cut in advance. Never assume that anyone is telling you the truth, including assurances of management's ""intent"". Do not believe the hype, but do believe the financial statements.

This is one I have to remind myself of, as I have played the game of screening for dividend stocks. Really, you cannot expect to find a deal unless you really have uncommon knowledge of why the stock is underpriced.

15-04-16,Automotive Retailers,"Im interested in the r/investing consensus on auto retailers, Autozone $AZO, Advance Auto Parts $AAP, and O'Reilly $ORLY. 

Autozone is the current top dog but they are playing semantics in stock buy backs when they could be buying anything and everything to build infrastructure. The company is backed by more institutions, carries a large house brand (Duralast), has big advertising presence. Big retail presence. Longest standing rewards program (physical card)

Advance auto parts is expanding in a HURRY. They bought Autopart International, General Parts and Carquest (and worldpac by association). They carry growing house brands (autocraft + wearever). They are big on the commercial side of the business but are wading into the retail side by acquisitions and expansion. They have taken on more corporate debt to build infrastructure. (and post dividends) The rewards program they run just started and is still getting its footing. (No card required just your phone number)

O'Reilly wants to grab market share, they are expanding fast by physically building rather than acquiring. Their advertising is ramping up to autozone levels. Rewards programs running smooth. Competitive with advance on pricing and promotion. The retail side is still building, orders dont have the sourcing Zone and Advance have.

Zone capitilizes in presence.

Advance capitilizes on sourcing.

**CHOP** is just really over extended with about 5.5 million float. I am expecting one of 2 things to happen tomorrow: 1- The stock gaps up above 3 and parabolics to ideally the 3.30 - 3-50 range. 2- the stock fails to hold 3 after testing a couple of times, then will fade off. Either way I will go short risking off the HOD.

**VLTC** had a little hiccup today. I fully expect the stock to either: have a weak open then have a red to green move and ramp up to the previous HODs and hold, or the stock washes out and collapses. I will be trading this one reactively. We aware that this is a very low float stock so squeezes are very possible. Also do not be shocked if this has the next ""GENE like"" drop.

**VGGL** This stock actually has a history of consistent spike ups followed the next day by falls. Ideally stock stock parabolics to the 2.4 mark in the morning, holds, and fades on the day. If it begins to washout I will short risking off of 2.2.

Realty Africa intends to stimulate growth and overcome negative perception

JOHANNEBURG – New platform Realty Africa will soon start offering small and big investors from all over the world the opportunity to invest in the growth and development of Sub-Saharan Africa. Through crowdfunding it intends to gather millions of dollars and euros each year for social housing, eco lodges, hotels, factories and other real estate projects.

By ensuring maximum safety, Realty Africa wants to overcome the negative perception of investing in Africa. Therefore service contracts have been closed with Deloitte and fiduciary servicer fund Imara, a first in crowdfunding.

Realty Africa is the first crowdfunding platform dedicated to property investments in Sub-Saharan Africa. ,,For developers in Africa and investors it is difficult to find each other. Most investors still find it scary to invest in Africa. That’s why experienced and large investors control almost the entire market,” says co-founder and CFO Erik van Eeten.
The platform gives investors access to markets, which have been historically out of reach, allowing them to invest amounts starting at a 1000 dollar with a good return. Also it allows  communities and project developers to raise capital, without high interest payments or collateral requirements.

The initiators have an international background. Co-founder and CEO Patrick Chella has fifteen years of experience in the banking and investment community in The Netherlands and Zimbabwe. Co-founder and CTO Emil Bengtsson has years of experience in ict. The platform has local teams and offices in The Netherlands, South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe and other countries. Already, various African projects have been evaluated and approved for crowdfunding, for example projects for family houses for local people and sustainable tourism.
Each project for which there is a demand and for which a realistic investment proposal can be made is eligible. Deloitte’s due diligence will screen each project before it is posted on the platform. Imara fiduciary services has assisted in drawing up a legal construction which prevent owners from selling their property. ,,Thus we provide maximum protection for investors,” says Van Eeten.

Today Realty Africa launched its own crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to gather the last of its needed starting capital. ( www.bit.ly/1JP3ye1)",1

Why this project?

My aim is reach as many people as possible because I have a dream about more peaceful world. We can bring Hope &amp; Opportunity to people with many invaluable tools for creating health, well-being, as well as personal and spiritual growth.

I believe if I can make someone smile, the world will become more peaceful place.Creating world peace takes many forms, but surely it begins with individuals. It continues to be the most significant challenge of humankind and requires the efforts of each of us.

I want to create many invaluable tools and make them accessible for everyone at anytime.

The question:

Can I make the World peaceful?

Don't think, ""what can I do?"" or that you are insignificant….,when the world is in a problem. You too have a role to play. A tiny homeopathic pill, which has a 1/100th, or 1/1000th potency, makes an impact on a body, which is sixty to seventy kilos! Scientists have discovered that a tiny change in one place, like the flapping of a butterfly's wings in South America, may produce a large effect in a far away location, like a tornado in Africa, which is called 'Butterfly effect'.

In the same way, every individual — everyone who is breathing, talking, walking, thinking - influences this planet. So we can all radiate peace, good thoughts, good vibrations, good wishes and that definitely makes an impact on the planet. Being peaceful in a meditative, prayerful state definitely helps.

Now we have a problem : The world is crying out for peace. Tune into the news today, and it’s evident: the world is becoming an increasingly violent place. Everyday we are increasingly asking: what can I do for peace? What can I do about wars, conflict and suffering?

It all starts in the mind. If we are not peaceful in our own mind, how can we be at peace with those around us?

How can I calm my mind – the answer is meditation, brainwave entertainment and daily wisdom to reminder us be happy. With your donate, we will create many projects to reduce stress, help people to calm their mind and reminder their that peaceful world is always possible. These projects will be everywhere: on phone, at metro &amp; bus station, at workplace... 

“Meditation is that technique that puts us in touch with ourselves. Meditation is that inward journey to find peace.”

All world problems, from military conflicts to domestic conflicts, are caused by violence. Through meditation we can remove the cause of violence, thus bringing peace to the world.
Any action that is undertaken without inner peace only leads to regret. And peace does not mean inaction. One has to use all methodologies to curb terrorism. We have to do it through education and persuasion. Force should be used only when nothing else works. Meditation and daily wisdom have transformed the aggression and violence inside people into compassion, love, and care. In these times of war and disease in the world, it’s so important that we all meditate a little bit every day. When we meditate, we nullify those vibrations, thereby creating a more harmonious environment around us.

Make every day a peace day! Start day with smile!!

15-04-17,A decline in oil and gas infrastructure spending in 2015/16 will put pressure on the oil and gas services and distribution industry,"According to Goldman Sachs (GS) and government department, there will be a projected fall of 30-40% decline in oil and gas capital expenditure within 2015/16. 

The decline in spending is similar in 2008/09 and 2002, click here 
for the graph:  http://goo.gl/efa9Eu.

The decline in 2002 and 2008/09 has devastating effects on the sector with declines in stock prices of 50% or more. 

At the moment, stocks like Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) is down 4% and 30% respectively, since July 2014. 

Capital spending in the oil and gas industry has been cut by $86bn in 2015 so far, and there will be further CAPEX cut later in the year when Exxon reports its results.

Balance sheet is gorgeous. $15.9B in assets vs $3.3B in liabilities. $5.9B of those assets are goodwill and intangibles, but that still leaves a clean $6.7B on the books.

Income statement: revenue is strong and consistent at over $2B per quarter. However profit is tiny. 8-9 figures per quarter.

15-04-17,Investing paralleled to roulette for a new investor.,"To start it needs to be said this is a super simplification of a very complicated concept. But I think read with a grain of salt can help explain to a new investor what they are buying with their money in a easily comprehensible way.

Generally when I started investing the majority said to begin the easy way with mutual funds. The proponents said 'It will diversify your money for you and mitigate risk.' 'These guys have a long track record of making the correct picks and your money is better off in their hands rather than you making 'blind' picks.' This is fine and probably somewhat sound advice there is another way to play that they should understand as well.

Mutual funds: Your chasing colors, you look at the board and see a streak of blacks and when you ask the dealer ( a broker) what he suggests he just looks to the board and nods. The past may not guarantee success you understand but it may be the best indicator a new investor can understand. This is fine you figure because you at least have a pretty good shot at good a fair return. You play your bets on black and some spins (days) you win and others you lose. The gains are small compared to number pickers but your risk is lower so your okay with that. Overall you feel your gaining ground as add to your pile of chips and it grows with time. The problem: Most fail to consider there are zeros on the board and that dealer (the house) is not giving you 50% odds as you thought but just a little below because the zeros (green) take away from what you thought was a solid return (the management fees the majority of these funds charge). 

Picking numbers: The odds are lower and you know this. However you do understand the odds. 1/37 is your shot to pick a winner and the upside is huge. You may not win on any of your picks in a given spin but the rolls you do there is potential for a huge upside depending on how heavy you play. 

Except in real life you can research your numbers (stocks) rather than picking your birthday and 21 because that's when you could start drinking. I know you can research mutual funds but at that point your beyond the instant I think you need one. Design your own, invest in several stocks at low quantities. No management fee.

TLDR: Just buy an index and pay sub 0.5% as they beat or match funds in the long term.

There are definitely better times to start investing than others. Look at a 20 year chart. The market goes through a recession/correction about every 7 years. That's when you should go in.

Edit: ok so clearly you guys disagree with me.
I personally believe that the market is ALL about timing. The smart guys go in after the recession not at the top. Do you seriously think professional investors just put their money in randomly because oh gee ya can't time the market.
Edit again: if you really believe you can't time the market then have fun waiting 40 years for some actual returns. Your beliefs will ruin you. Buy low sell high. It's so simple yet so few really live by it. But I guess the markets are just so confusing and random that it's better to just not use your head and randomly throw money at the market and just pray it continues to go up

Edit again again: and do you really think this bull market is going to last forever? China is slowing down. Europe is in a shit hole. The United States will be ending qe soon. Student loan debt is through the roof. Income inequality is as rampant as ever. Do you really think they solved the problems from the 2008 crisis? Watch inside job. All the same people are in power again. You know the banks need to be doing something fishy if they're making this much money. There is a massive correction coming soon. Have cash ready to invest at the bottom to truly buy low and sell high.
Peace out

15-04-17,Aggressive Roth IRA Allocation,"I'm trying to decide my strategy for my IRA before I start funding it.  I'm 18 years old and going to a community college in the fall for my first two years before transferring to a larger college. I'm expecting to pay almost entirely out of pocket for the next two years, at the very most around $5k. (The school is very cheap to attend and I received a very generous amount of financial aid.)  The following two years I expect to cost no more than $30k.  I am perusing a degree in either business or finance, I will narrow my path down as I go.

I live with my dad and will continue to live with my dad through school.  I don't have to pay rent and everything for my vehicle is paid for by him except for gas, so I will have very few other expenses.

I'm currently employed part time at a car wash.  I'm the only employee aside from my boss.  I can expect to work anywhere between 25 and 50 hours per week (Largely dependent on the weather) at $8.50/hour in wages and roughly $3/hour in tips.  This job is pretty secured for the next two years before I go off for my final 2 years of school and I expect raises as time goes on.

 Here's my rough outline for my Roth IRA.  I will also be posting this in /r/investing and /r/personalfinance as it's something that belongs more in their subreddits than this one, but I would still like opinions from here as we tend not to be as conservative as them.

I'm looking to do this mostly on my own through ETFs and individual stocks though I have selected one mutual fund because it gives me the small cap exposure I want at while being actively managed by experts. 

**-33% Small-Cap Growth** -  PLWAX Mutual Fund - I am looking for small cap growth exposure.  Originally I was going to do this myself by buying a Russel 2000 ETF, but this fund does exactly that and would be more actively managed than an ETF.  If anyone else has an ETF or Mutual fund alternative to suggest go ahead and suggest it.

**-22% Mid-Cap Growth** - Looking at either IWP or VOT.  Open to other suggestions

**-25% Large-Cap Growth** - VUG, Open to suggestions.

**-15% Individual Stock Holding** - Reserving this for my personal long picks which may change from time to time.  Mostly eyeing WETF, BRK-B, FB, AAPL.  Open to opinions.

**-10% REITs** - I'll slowly reduce this allocation if interest rates rise to a point where these begin to be effected.  Main targets are AMT, ORC, O.  Open to other's opinions.",0

15-04-17,Can anybody give me a good reason why the price of oil should continue to climb?,"So far I have been replied to with:


**OPEC controls the market** -  

*OPEC used to be the say all end all to oil. Their problem is very transparent now though. If they artificially inflate prices, they will lose market share to people who can produce oil at those higher prices. They have very cheap oil, and the only thing they can do is produce more of that cheap oil to hamper foreign production...but at the same time they are trying to keep prices inflated while pumping and selling as much oil as they can. They simply don't have as much power as they used to....because they don't have an option like they used to.*

**No I insist, OPEC controls the market because if they say they are going to cutback production, the price will jump**

*I think you are half right. If they said we're dropping production, yes prices would skyrocket....right along with everyone else's production, and then we would have a supply glut...kind of like right now. The thing is...they can't say they are decreasing production...and they don't want to say they are increasing...but they are.*

**Oil is too big to fail**

*So your best argument is that oil is too big to fail? The government is going to bail out oil companies if they go belly up? I think growth and profits accelerate when the price of energy comes down...I would think consolidation in the oil industry would just lead to organic economic growth...rather than a disaster. It would be a disaster to people who have invested too heavily in oil.*


**""because we depend on it"", ""oil is king"", ""energy density"", oh and corn...just fucking corn** http://redd.it/32tiu1  

*not going to reply, unless you insist*


**My own argument - The dollar could be on the decline**

*well semitard that is a good argument, why thank you semitard, but the problem is still there if the dollar inflates price...we have a supply glut. If the value of the dollar decreases, and oil continues to climb, it becomes economical for a lot of wells to come back online, and production will ramp, and at the same time, if prices are up, then demand will most likely go down. I suppose we could lift the export band at that point (or any point), but then what do you think OPEC will do?...not stop drilling and losing customers, that is for sure.*

**Rig count**

http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Jaffe-Despite-global-risk-oil-prices-could-head-6197500.php
 
*Jaffe put the break-even prices for oil production at $37 in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota, $48 for the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and $43 for the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma and Kansas.*

http://247wallst.com/energy-business/2015/04/12/low-crude-oil-prices-leave-thousands-of-u-s-wells-uncompleted/ 

*There are roughly 2,500 to 3,500 drilled but uncompleted oil wells in the United States, according to analysts at IHS Inc. (NYSE: IHS). As many as 1,400 of those wells are located in the Eagle Ford shale play in south Texas.*

*What do you think rig count is going to do if oil goes up?*

*Oh and plus, there are a lot of wells that still have to be completed by law...*

http://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/oil-production-down-second-straight-month/article_8f3183a6-ff1f-5a79-b972-a1bd8e67b7c6.html

*Wells must be completed within one year of being drilled by state law. More than 100 wells will hit that deadline in June.*

**Demand is going to increase**

*This is highly speculative, and loses weight as prices increase...and in my opinion a little ignorant considering the current oversupply. I don't think that demand has had its run and is over. I think that the control over the price of oil has had its run, and is now over. Production and demand are going to dictate prices, not so much politics and geology.*

**Iran deal is going to fall through**

*Probably, maybe not. Doesn't change the fact that they are increasing production and still have outlets to sell their oil.*

**Everyone including Goldman Sachs say oil will fall to new lows, I do the opposite**

*This pisses me off that I have to add this, but apparently a lot of people agree (which in itself is funny). Ok...so all the info available, and the people familiar with the situation are expecting the price of oil to go down...so naturally you are a genius contrarian investor that is about to make a killing. So that means you must have bought WTI when it was in the $40's, and when everyone was scared it would keep going down (like all the info suggest). Now what? Oil is up about 30% from that low...when people were being ""greedy"". You think oil is going to just keep shooting up? How much more? 40%, 50%, 220%? If you are buying up oil now, I would say you're jumping on a retard fueled band wagon, you are not being greedy, you are not being a contrarian investor, you are being a fucktard (if this is you're only argument). You might be able to make an argument about being greedy when oil goes back down to the $40 range, but I think I'm going to wait for more like the low $30. Also, I think the fact this same post got down voted to 0 in /r/stocks proves my point as well.*

**Big picture.. we are barely oversupplied. When you talk millions yeah reserves can build up**

*I agree, but oversupplied none the less...and reserves are still building. If the price of oil goes up, even more will go into storage, I think we agree here.*

**Not to mention there are still emerging markets where oil will become a necessity on top of the fact that the population of the world is not diminishing. It's expanding exponentially**

*Silly thing about humanity is that we evolve, technology evolves, infrastructure for emerging markets evolve. I completely agree that demand will increase. Emerging markets will grow...even faster with cheap energy. Renewable energy will still keep growing faster. Can you imagine how much different the world will be once we can harness fusion power? Anyhow, daily dependence on oil will decrease over time. And, we add about 1 billion people every 15 years...since about 1960, not exactly exponential (thanks for making me look that up.)*

**Finally shale wells peter out fast**

*yeah, I think it's like 90% of production is the first 2 years. We have somewhere between 2500 and 3500 wells just waiting to start producing though...*

**Another conflict will spill over some borders in the Middle East**

*This is probably the best argument I have got yet, and one that I'm fairly ill equipped to argue. I can say that it is highly speculative, but not really far fetched. I do feel like bringing an end to the control over oil could help the middle east get together for the better good of their nations to export as much oil as they can, but I feel like I should slap myself for saying that.* 

**a discovery completely undermining the estimated reserves left**

*again, very speculative for near term, but not far fetched...and something we should be expecting in the future, but how far into the future...who knows. I do know we are growing less dependent on oil, and are moving towards renewables, plus technology evolves.  Since we are being speculative, I pose this question...What happens to the world once humanity figures out how to harness fusion power?...there will be a lot of people who will give a lot less fucks about oil when that happens (and we are very close).*

15-04-17,CABN revolutionize graphene manufacturing?,"So stumbled upon this company and this looks like this may be a great gamble. They were a natural gas to liquid fuel business but last year pivoted to developing a mass scale production of graphene. If you don't know what graphene is please read up on it as it is likely the biggest push forward to nanotechnology. 

They then partnered with the UC Santa Barbara to help develop this technology. In January they created a new company owned 50% by CABN and 50% by Kaustav Banerjee the director of Nanoelectronic research lab at UC Santa Barbara. 

That said they are operating on debt and a pretty high amount of it but on April 7th they hired Dr. Rajeeva Lahri as a technical advisor who has had a strong presence in the semiconductor and solar industry. But he has an extensive background with venture capital. 


With that background I will say again this still is a huge gamble as they didn't have anything yet. However having worked in a prestigious schools lab I've seen some of the great breakthroughs possible. With the creation of a company between CABN and Banerjee in January 2015 I'm lead to believe they have very early processes indicating success that will require refinement and scaling even more. With the current financial statements they are high in debt but if they can get the involment of venture capital they may have enough to produce the mass production of graphene process. 

If they can do this coupled with the current expectations of they likely can either become one of the largest producers of graphene (if they are first to scale the production) or patent out their technology. 

So this looks to me to be very high risk but possibly very high reward. The company is adjusting to the market demands and changing their business model. They seem to have the right people and the right idea it just comes down to the question of if they can executive that plan. 

Anyone else have thoughts on them?

15-04-17,THCZ Hype Train Should Be A Good Example Of.....,"why you should avoid these sketchy weed OTC pennystocks if you don't know what you're doing (especially these kinds of stocks, they really punish bad traders). 

HOWEVER, I here people saying this stuff is not predictable. That is so false it's insane. It is very predictable AS LONG AS you are not buying/shorting the thing without a proper setup to occur first. You need to keep in mind any tiny piece of good news is going to have this stock skyrocket. You can pretty much prove it is hype and not real news by its action intraday, a parabolic move out of the gate (people hyped on whatever the news was) and slowly fading (hype faded off). The grinding action was the stock bouncing off the .215 mark. (punished bad shorts)

Think of it like this: You are always going to wait for a setup to occur first THEN trade it. Not trade anticipating a setup. 

**Example:** Right now it had a slow steady grind back up to the .24 mark intraday. What is likely going to happen? It will likely test, over and under and fade off again.

15-04-18,Tech company discussion: LinkedIn,"I’ve been looking at a few tech companies, one of them being LinkedIn (LNKD).  I’d like to share my brief qualitative analysis so far of this company to get some discussion going.  Not going to go into valuation, but that could be another thread if people are interested.

Their moat:  

* Tremendous network effect.  The more users join and connect with each other, the more useful and valuable it is for the users.
* Brand.  They’ve become the leading professional social network in most of the world.  Students are beginning to be taught since college that they need a profile.
* Multiple channels of income: they make money from recruiters/companies using their platform to recruit, ads sales, and member subscriptions.  This is all driven by the previously mentioned network effect.

Weaknesses and potential competitors:

* Segmented networks for niche industries, e.g. social network for doctors
* Facebook moving into the professional space with their existing network of users.  Recruiters are already using Facebook to recruit, so this could be a threat.  Other companies making productivity tools could also move into this space.  It’s all about having existing data to bootstrap a network.

Potential for further growth:

* Continue getting users engaged and locked in.  LinkedIn is already building out their news offering and building a publishing platform to distribute user generated content.  They’ve recently purchased lynda.com, a site with training videos for various topics, which is a nice offering for professionals already on LinkedIn.
- International member base is still expanding.  They’re one of the few US social networks allowed in China, mainly because international business provides value for the professionals inside China, unlike personal social networks.
- They are building a new product for finding sales lead, which has potential to match their recruiter product revenue, which is currently their biggest.
- The overall recruiting market is more than 100B.  LinkedIn currently has about 1.5B revenue from their recruiting product.  There is still a lot more room to grow. ",4

-

I am going to try out a classic thing I used to do. I basically list the most probable outcomes of tomorrow and what I would do. It is similar to how I make watchlists now, just a bit less specific. Let me know if you guys like this style better!

**CHOP-** Is a low float pennystock that is extremely overextended. I will by no means long this stock. I am looking for a nice weak open, bounce off of 4 to a strong red to green move. I like the stock to parabolic to the 4.50 mark, hopefully putting in highs and will make for a great short. If the stock cannot hold 4, I will go short risking off that mark as there is likely big upside. Will be shorting fades and parabolic moves, not buying.

**REN-** Looking for a weak open. Red to green move. I will be **buying** (gasp) dips as long as it holds the 1.3 mark! If the stock gets ahead of itself I will be looking to get on the short side (parabolic move out of the gate).

**ZBB-** is light on volume but I will attempt to trade it anyway. Ideally the stock tests 1 and fails right out the gate. I am anticipating it to fade on the day after if fails.

**SZYM-** will be using 4.4 as a guide to either: get long risking off it, or get short if the stock holds under. If the stock begins to perk off that mark, I will be going long adding into dips.

**VLTC-** expecting a weak open bouncing off of 8.50. I wouldn't dare go long on this stock, I would only go short on a big overextended parabolic move or late day fades. Be very careful on this low float stock!

**AMCN-** only shorting the fade setup, pretty much has to snap the 4.25 mark

**BSPM-** expecting a gap up push toward the previous HODs, I will be getting short on parabolic moves into that 1.7 mark! I would highly suggest not shorting this stock if it is able to hold above 1.7 and grind up.

I thought I would mention this here, please keep the discussion about the watchlist/stocks we are trading. I want to avoid any drama. I already PM'd the admin mods, that is all I can do to get him unbanned. Keep in mind my intent was never to get anyone banned, no matter what anyone says.",7

-
Since people didn't like my posts about THCZ being extremely dangerous. I thought I would make a post about it being dangerous...except with facts backing it up.

First off lets start with the fundamentals, they are a complete joke. The company is not making any income from their products. (As of March 31, 2015). However, I think it is pretty safe to say that this stock is NOT an investment. I wouldn't think anyone is actually investing in this. However, I did find this: http://imgur.com/BeaB7hu. That is extremely fucking scary, when they pay in shares and not money. But nevermind that, lets move on.

Frequently said things about THCZ:

**""well if you get in and get out quickly for a profit, what is the big deal?""**: it isn't my money but let me say this, how is that going to playout in the longrun? If you get in, one washout will kill an entire months of scalping (trust me I have tried). This is IMO a very risky and reckless strategy that in reality is just gambling. 

**""just because THCZ was a pump doesn't make it a bad buy""**: It is hard to say these people are wrong when everyone is reporting gains...... But in reality most are losing. Hell I am confident that 80%+ of the people on this subreddit have lost on this stock but are not saying anything. You really shouldn't brag about buying stuff like this either, because it can quickly drop 50% (which it did once already) and you lose it all. 

Also another thing: please don't brag about trades you made, especially when you never say your losses. On a stock like THCZ where it is complete gambling(at least the way some people on this subreddit trade it). There isn't even a strategy, you are relying on people to get squeezed or hype to pickup....

Now to the technical analysis, my bread and butter. First off the stock chart is pretty much how most hyped OTC stocks look. They usually follow this pattern:

Pump up, overextension, collapse, rebound but not to the peak of the previous high, then fades. Almost always. I would be shocked if this stock does not start fading by Monday. 

Another thing I hear is it is too unpredictable. Unpredictable for what? Swingtrading? This doesn't even make sense, for any sub-par trader (no offense) it is impossible to see what is going on. For me (not to say I am a great trader) back when the 50% drop happened, I figured it was either going to bounce back to about the .20-.25 range or just fade back to where it should be. People that are super long bias on this stock will **never** give you a true reason as to why the stock should go up. And people that are shorting this stock prematurely are also getting burned.

SourcingLink.net, Inc Is Primed To Capitalize On Chinese Restrictions On Exports Of Rare Earth Minerals As Canadian Prime Minster Pushes For More Global Mining Trade.
 
April 16 2015 (10:36pm CST) Rare earth minerals are highly coveted for their vital role in the manufacture of high-tech electronics devices, advanced medical equipment and military hardware, among many other applications.

In a January 7th 2015 Reuters article it is stated that China supplies 90% of the world's rare earth supplies. There are only two companies outside of China that currently produce rare earth metals one of them being SourcingLink.net, Inc.

Japan imports 56 percent of China's rare earth exports total output to fuel it high-tech industry. Facing uncertainty in that supply chain that would dramatically be affected by the potential loss and or increasing demand Japan must diversify its channels for importing rare earth elements. As Japan searched for a more secure supply of rare earth minerals located in North America. Japan has been drawing on their own stock piles since mid 2014 leaving the tremendously depleted the potential to effect tech output in 2015 and the future.

Canadian Prime Minister Harper met with Japanese Prime Minister Abe on March 25, 2014 on the margins of the Nuclear Security Summit in The Hague. The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to advance the Canada-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement CJEPA in parallel with the TPP negotiations, in line with the strong support for the CJEPA that was already expressed during Prime Minister Abe's official visit to Ottawa in September 2013. Source Government of Canada Website http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/japan-japon/background-contexte.aspx?lang=eng

Prime Minster Harper is looking to continue the success of these mining partnerships as he recently announced India's deal to import uranium from Saskatchewan Company Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) on April 15th 2015. This is the first of what could be possibly more multi-hundred million dollar mining deals that Harper plans to continue with moving towards an election in the Fall.

""SourcingLink.net, Inc. signed an agreement to acquire 100% interest in the Eldor Rare Earth Property Claims (The Eldor Project) located in Northern Quebec, Canada (one of the most favorable mining jurisdictions in the world). The Eldor Project consists of 334 mineral claims covering approximately 3951 acres and is located in Northern Quebec which is considered one of the most favorable mining jurisdictions in the world."" - Source http://www.marketwatch.com/story/north-american-rare-earth-suppliers----vital-for-future-global-needs-2015-02-27

What is a Mutual Fund?

A mutual fund is an investment company, represented by a single ticker, that raises money by selling shares of the fund to the public, who become shareholders. A professional mutual fund manager, that charges a fee, then uses that money to buy groups of stocks, bonds, short-term money market instruments, and/or other securities.The shareholders receive an equity position in the fund and, in effect, in each of the underlying securities.

What is an Index?

An index is nothing more than a list of stocks; anybody can create one. The
most widely followed index is the S&amp;P 500, consisting of 500 hand picked large companies selected by Standard &amp; Poor’s. The best known index fund is the Vanguard 500 Index Fund from The Vanguard Group, which tracks the S&amp;P 500.
Others include the Russell 2000 (small companies), the DJ Wilshire 5000 (total stock market), the MSCI EAFE (foreign stocks in Europe, Australasia, Far East) and the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index (total bond market) are widely used for index funds.
indexWhat are Index Funds?

When an investor purchases a share of an index fund, he or she is purchasing a share of a portfolio that contains the securities in an underlying index. The index fund holds the securities in the same proportion as they occur in the actual index, and when the index decreases in value, the fund’s shares decrease as well, and vice versa. The only time an index buys or sells a stock is when the index itself changes.
Since index funds stocks do not change as frequently (they are passive, unlike stock funds that are active); therefore index funds do not incur as many expenses to pay for transaction costs and broker fees.
An index fund will attempt to achieve its investment objective primarily by investing in the securities (stocks or bonds) of companies that are included in a selected index.
Some index funds invest in all of the companies included in an index; other index funds invest in a representative sample of the companies included in an index.
Index funds have ticker symbols and are traded on all major exchanges.
Index funds are not actively traded for performance; they simply follow the performance of the index to which they are tied.
Index funds are available for most any index. Some index funds replicate broad market indexes, and some replicate indexes that only contain securities with special characteristics, including minimum financial ratios, participation in a certain industry, geography, or other distinctions.
What makes Index funds good – less expensive, less volatile, diverse, can have high dividend return, often beat the broad indexes.

Diversification — Each index fund represents an interest in an underlying basket of securities so investors can gain broad exposure to a large group of companies easily.
Index Funds are much less volatile than individual securities because of the diversification.
Buying and selling shares of an index fund is far less expensive than separately buying and selling a basket of underlying shares.
Many index funds pass through the accumulated dividends paid by their underlying stocks
Studies have proven that over time, the average mutual fund typically fails to beat the broad indexes",1

**TLDR;**Put in $20 in robinhood as a joke. Bought cheap stocks as result. Became interested in short-term technical analysis strategies. Developing TA strategies here for extremely short-term trading. Not a thread to discuss the credibility and reliability of TA.
-
For the past month I have put in only $20 dollars in Robinhood (at first as a joke and for shits and giggles) but I have been buying nasdaq and nyse pennies and surprisingly have been getting some good return %. As a result, I started to develop my own strategy for very short-term holdings. Everyday I will post my positions and summary of the stock and if you guys are interested we could possibly come to a conclusion with general SHORT-TERM technical analysis strategies (i will only be holding positions for a month max). I know majority of people at r/stocks frown upon the idea of technical analysis but the purpose of this project isn't to debate about the credibility between technical or fundamental analysis, rather to study it as a test to see if we can even come up with a somewhat reliable short-term TA strategy.

I did not follow these rules for some positions as I have developed these strategies by testing the methods on the previously bought positions. But as we continue to develop a strategy I will follow it strictly and record the results here for analysis and discussion by you guys.

- Average volume &gt; 1m for liquidity purposes
- Beta above 1 and below 2. A little volatility is good but too much is too risky
- Market cap &lt; 2b because we want companies with potential for growth
- RSI
- 20/50/200 day SMA
- 20/50/200 day EMA

This made me look up their stock info, and subsequently their top two competitors CNK and RGC, which all seem pretty strong.

15-04-18,Stock portfolio rebalancing,"Hi,

I have a stock portfolio that has grown substantially over the last 10 years. Over this time period my investing capacity has increased somewhat so at the beginning my typical investment for each stock would be about 1,000 and now I am investing about 5,000 per stock. 

This has created a portfolio where some sticks with very good returns are assigned only one to two thousand dollars and some duds have been sitting on five thousand for a while.

I have read about some rebalancing methods, for example, keeping a specific amount for each stock, say 4,000 dollars, and selling out buying every quarter or month, to adjust each stock to this amount.

 So my question is this, first, should I rebalance the portfolio and second what methods would you recommend to do this? 

Most of the rebalancing info I have read is about stock vs bond, or asset class allocation, but not specifically about stocks.

Thanks for all your help and input

I've held $AAL since December 2014, hoping that with more money in people's pockets they might consider holidays abroad + low oil prices. (Currently down 2%) 

Now, last week I took advantage of a monthly reduced commission offer  (£3.95 per trade instead of £12.95) and to put it bluntly, I just went with my gut. 

50 $MSFT shares, bought in the knowledge that Windows 10 is being very well accepted in geeky circles. Since the subscription model for Office 365 seems to be fairly popular I think it would easy for them to tie that in with a Windows 10 subscription, getting all of their users on the same software. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So there's a look into to my trading history, now the trade I'm most excited about: $INVN. From what I understand nobody seems to agree on the prospects, but it's sensors seem to be getting into massive products and markets (iPhone 6, Samsung S6, Google nexus devices, drones, VR headsets, wearables (Apple Watch tear-down this week?!) 
Of course there are competitors, but they currently seem to be the go to for these markets and I and a few others don't think the current price reflects that.

So, I bought 112 shares. I'd really appreciate comments on my trading activities so far, your opinions on $INVN and anything I could do to make my posts better here in the future!

Cheers, Peter.

1. The line was wayyyy longer than what I normally would see at a Starbucks

2. I actually like their selection more. It's not as fancy pancy as Starbucks, but they have a variety of unhealthy things. Starbucks reminds me of a Subway (healthier, ,menu very basic) vs. a McDonalds (unhealthy, menu is all over the place with stuff).

Now my friend just did some marketing for Dunkin Donuts for a grand opening in California and I guess people are eating it up. I don't see Dunkin Donuts taking over Starbucks anytime in the near future, but they definitely will take a chunk of their coffee pie. It looks like Dunkin is starting to pick up that trendy cool vibe. They use an orange straw instead of Starbuck's green straw.

15-04-19,Are the US markets truly overvalued and due for a correction or is it relatively speaking fairly priced especially in regards to bonds and other asset classes?,"The argument about whether the US stock markets are overpriced is one that splits many experts in finance. 


Is the market overpriced or is it that it is fair priced considering the returns of bonds and cash. Those who argue that the markets are not over priced will say that in actual fact everything is relative. Many asset classes are substitutes for each other and different asset classes have different risks. If the risk “free return” attained from either bonds or cash is very extremely low. Then stocks, which return 5 percent for example look very attractive. The idea is that whilst stocks are somewhat pricy at current prices, they still return using conservatively estimated DCF models several percentage points above the risk free return of 0.02 percent return of US 10 week corporate bonds. Thus people are willing to pay historically somewhat inflated prices for what historically would have been a lower return. However, this is because bonds yields and interest rates are so low not because there is a problem with sentiment.

 Anyway this is one of the arguments to justify the bull market and it continued life. Personally, I at this point I am not really sure about the immediate future of the stock markets as there are convincing arguments on both sides. What do you guys think?

Why is not important, the question is - how do I make money from it?

I've been looking at options of how to invest in this hypothesis:

* Tourism - I can't really find a good way to invest in Mexican tourism.  A mexican tourism ETF sounds like a long shot.  I looked at hotel companies but I don't think there are any Mexican hotel chains that I can buy stock in.

* Real estate - I thought I had a better shot at finding a Mexican real estate ETF, but I can't seem to locate one.  There is an ""emerging markets"" real estate ETF, but I want to avoid anything that's going to get me involved with China.  

I could invest in a general Mexico ETF like EWW, but that's really a last resort because there are many things besides crime that can affect the economy.  So does anyone know of any better ideas?

15-04-19,[Updated] Can anyone give me a good reason why the price of oil should go up?,"This post has now become over the size limit (so this is last update), I had to edit out some redundant arguments. I would still appreciate reasons that you see oil climbing, because with everything so far, I seem pretty sure it is going to find a new low.

**This is the best supporting answer that I have got, thanks /r/whatdoiwantsk**

*USD rally + OPEC not cutting = oil prices crash. That's pretty much all there is to it. Either or especially both of those change, and we'll see a reversal.*

**These are the arguments that I was replied to with on why oil should climb, and my responses:**


**OPEC controls the market**/r/drunkenstarcraft  

*OPEC used to be the say all end all to oil. Their problem is very transparent now though. If they artificially inflate prices, they will lose market share to people who can produce oil at those higher prices. They have very cheap oil, and the only thing they can do is produce more of that cheap oil to hamper foreign production...but at the same time they are trying to keep prices inflated while pumping and selling as much oil as they can. They simply don't have as much power as they used to....because they don't have an option like they used to.*

**No I insist, OPEC controls the market because if they say they are going to cutback production, the price will jump** /r/staticchange

*I think you are half right. If they said we're dropping production, yes prices would skyrocket....right along with everyone else's production, and then we would have a supply glut...kind of like right now. The thing is...they can't say they are decreasing production...and they don't want to say they are increasing...but they are.*

**Oil is too big to fail** /r/letthebasskick

*So your best argument is that oil is too big to fail? The government is going to bail out oil companies if they go belly up? I think growth and profits accelerate when the price of energy comes down...I would think consolidation in the oil industry would just lead to organic economic growth...rather than a disaster. It would be a disaster to people who have invested too heavily in oil.*

**""because we depend on it"", ""oil is king"", ""energy density"" /r/hokaythxbai, oh and corn...just fucking corn** http://redd.it/32tiu1  

*not going to reply, unless you insist*

**My own argument - The dollar could be on the decline**

*The problem is still there if the dollar inflates price...we have a supply glut. If the value of the dollar decreases, and oil continues to climb, it becomes economical for a lot of wells to come back online, and production will ramp, and at the same time, if prices are up, then demand will most likely go down. I suppose we could lift the export band at that point (or any point), but then what do you think OPEC will do?...not stop drilling and losing customers, that is for sure.*

**Rig count** /r/hexmasta

http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Jaffe-Despite-global-risk-oil-prices-could-head-6197500.php
 
*Jaffe put the break-even prices for oil production at $37 in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota, $48 for the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and $43 for the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma and Kansas.*

http://247wallst.com/energy-business/2015/04/12/low-crude-oil-prices-leave-thousands-of-u-s-wells-uncompleted/ 

*There are roughly 2,500 to 3,500 drilled but uncompleted oil wells in the United States, according to analysts at IHS Inc. (NYSE: IHS). As many as 1,400 of those wells are located in the Eagle Ford shale play in south Texas.*

*What do you think rig count is going to do if oil goes up?*

*Oh and plus, there are a lot of wells that still have to be completed by law...*

http://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/oil-production-down-second-straight-month/article_8f3183a6-ff1f-5a79-b972-a1bd8e67b7c6.html

*Wells must be completed within one year of being drilled by state law. More than 100 wells will hit that deadline in June.*

**Demand is going to increase** /r/staticchange

*This is highly speculative, and loses weight as prices increase...and in my opinion a little ignorant considering the current oversupply. I don't think that demand has had its run and is over. I think that the control over the price of oil has had its run, and is now over. Production and demand are going to dictate prices, not so much politics and geology.*

**Iran deal is going to fall through** /r/norcon

*Probably, maybe not. Doesn't change the fact that they are increasing production and still have outlets to sell their oil.*

**Everyone including Goldman Sachs say oil will fall to new lows, I do the opposite** /r/vixgdx, /r/sharked...others

*This pisses me off that I have to add this, but apparently a lot of people agree (which in itself is funny). Ok...so all the info available, and the people familiar with the situation are expecting the price of oil to go down...so naturally you are a genius contrarian investor that is about to make a killing. So that means you must have bought WTI when it was in the $40's, and when everyone was scared it would keep going down (like all the info suggest). Now what? Oil is up about 30% from that low...when people were being ""greedy"". You think oil is going to just keep shooting up? How much more? 40%, 50%, 220%? If you are buying up oil now, I would say you're jumping on a retard fueled band wagon, you are not being greedy, you are not being a contrarian investor, you are being a fucktard (if this is your'e only argument). You might be able to make an argument about being greedy when oil goes back down to the $40 range, but I think I'm going to wait for more like the low $30. Also, I think the fact this same post got down voted to 0 in /r/stocks proves my point as well.*

**Not to mention there are still emerging markets where oil will become a necessity on top of the fact that the population of the world is not diminishing. It's expanding exponentially**/r/cod3r__

*Silly thing about humanity is that we evolve, technology evolves, infrastructure for emerging markets evolve. I completely agree that demand will increase. Emerging markets will grow...even faster with cheap energy. Renewable energy will still keep growing faster. Can you imagine how much different the world will be once we can harness fusion power? Anyhow, daily dependence on oil will decrease over time. And, we add about 1 billion people every 15 years...since about 1960, not exactly exponential (thanks for making me look that up.)*

**Another conflict will spill over some borders in the Middle East** /r/arKK

*This is probably the best argument I have got yet, and one that I'm fairly ill equipped to argue. I can say that it is highly speculative, but not really far fetched. I do feel like bringing an end to the control over oil could help the middle east get together for the better good of their nations to export as much oil as they can, but I feel like I should slap myself for saying that.* 

**a discovery completely undermining the estimated reserves left** /r/arKK

*again, very speculative for near term, but not far fetched...and something we should be expecting in the future, but how far into the future...who knows. I do know we are growing less dependent on oil, and are moving towards renewables, plus technology evolves.  Since we are being speculative, I pose this question...What happens to the world once humanity figures out how to harness fusion power?...there will be a lot of people who will give a lot less fucks about oil when that happens (and we are very close).*

**Wait, back to OPEC...As far as OPEC goes, they have to do something. At the current price point, OPEC by majority is not happy.**/r/KU76

*Very true. In order for a large portion of OPEC to remain fiscal balance, oil needs to be higher....how much higher?....ridiculously higher. According to Thomsan Reuters it starts at ~$58 for Qatar, and ends at ~$136 for Iran.* 

http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/14/opec/index.html

*Why? Because it's not a private business over there. Fiscal breakeven pays for a majority of their ""government"" expenditures....including subsidies and royal privileges. The cost that it actually takes them to produce a barrel of oil is actually the cheapest on earth. They have been so used to relying on oil production, and having the ability to manipulate the market, that they have grown very used to making a very wide margin. The profits from oil in Saudi Arabia account for ~80% of what the ""government"" spends....which is why on the above Thompsan Reuters chart, it says their breakeven is ~$93.*

https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/oil-revenue-as-a-share-of-government-revenue-opec-member-non-opec-member_chartbuilder.jpg?w=640

*So, it's funny that they are increasing production. Why?...to drive out U.S. shale. But wait, how long are they going to be able to do that for? Not very, even though they have massive reserves, they also have massive expenditures...a few years probably at best. This is where I get speculative, and what this half tard thinks is going on. The thing is, is that this is a bit of an economic war that is going on. Guess who is good at war...and economics? There is a bit of chess going on right now. Shale put OPEC in check. OPEC's only option is to adjust. There is a lot of corruption, a lot of waist, a lot of arrogance...that just got put into check. So it's their move. From the looks of things, I would say they are hell bent on applying the pressure back on Shale...which will work (hasn't quite yet)...but, (I believe at least) it will drive out some competition for a bit...no, not forever. They are going to have to diversify their economies....which is a good thing. Saudi Arabia has openly admitted to this, as well as Putin...and they have been working on it. So, what am I saying? What I have been saying, supply and demand are going to dictate the price of oil....not so much politics and geology. Right now we are oversupplied, and that is going to get worse...for now.*

**why would OPEC shoot themselves in the foot to regain market share from US Shale, that will just as quickly be lost?  Possibly the U.S. hired OPEC to drop oil prices to put the hurt on Russia for the whole Ukraine/Crimea situation last year, which comes with the added benefit of boosting the US economy.** /r/KU76

*I have been beating my head to understand how Russia ties into all this...I've been especially curious as to the recent deviation the Ruble has taken from the price of oil. Most recent signs say that Russia's economy is on the rebound...which doesn't make a whole lot of since in my book. If there are some behind the scenes maneuvering going on, I would say that Russia is doing really good at withstanding it so far, and that gives me more reason to suspect that this June meeting will maintain the current course, until some hurt starts really getting applied to where it is intended to be directed, be it shale or Russia.*

**Also, the majority of new discoveries are shale, deepwater or tar sands. These all need oil around $100 to be viable.** /r/the_ultravixens

*http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Jaffe-Despite-global-risk-oil-prices-could-head-6197500.php
Jaffe put the break-even prices for oil production at $37 in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota, $48 for the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and $43 for the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma and Kansas.*

oil sands

*Breakeven costs for existing projects such as Kearl Phase 1 stand at US$42 per barrel, with Husky’s Lloydminster (US$28), Cenvous’ Christina Lake ($26) and Suncor operations (US$30.3), all comfortably below WTI’s current price of US$46 per barrel, Citibank data shows.*

Deepwater

*the average breakeven oil price needed for new deepwater Gulf of Mexico developments in early stages of construction is between $65 and $75 per barrel. That “breakeven” implies a long-term annualized 10% return on capital.*

*Now, there was a lot more money being thrown at all these projects when oil was over $100, and I do agree that there will be a lot less investment if oil stays, or decrease...but like a said, there has already been significant investment in projects to keep supply climbing for the next several years.*

**If you look at the finances of the shale drillers, nobody was running a positive cashflow at $100 per barrel, so there is simply no way that breakevens are $45 outside of the most prolific core areas.** /r/the_ultravixens

*I believe we agree that the most costly oil is deepwater...so I looked up Seadrill's EPS from Q1 '14, and it was $1.58...they most certainly were making money.*

**Wind and solar provide around 1% of global energy, and it's all in the form of electricity. They currently do not fuel aeroplanes, trucks, boats or combine harvesters. In the timescales we're discussing (up to maybe 5-10 years max) they are irrelevant.** /r/the_ultravixens

*You are right here, they are still in their infancies. This section is growing very quickly. The technology is growing, the infastucture is growing, and the efficiency is growing. I think it will still be ~3 decades before we are running off renewable energy...I'm hoping for sooner, but we will most certainly have enough oil to make it*",2
15-04-19,ETFs vs. Index Funds,"I was reading into the Vanguard 3 fund portfolio model and came upon a question. They advocate buying three funds, either all index funds or all ETFs, obviously because of diversification and low cost.

15-04-19,"Been working on a Smart Google Spreadsheet to track my portfolio that will automatically inform me of problems. I finally perfected it, so here it is!","I've been stuck at home all weekend, being sick, so I've been working on a new spreadsheet to track my investments, since I haven't found one that met all my needs or was easy to use. So [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m98UCQvmmUbMK4VlodU5xTqszhMLbFSx8lgcfI4RcL8/edit) it is! 

Quick overview of the what I wanted it do: 

I own a few random stocks I prospect via Schwab, that I wanted to quickly be able to look at a day's performance. The majority of my investments are done with a lazy portfolio via Vanguard, though, so this is what I really wanted the spreadsheet for. 

Features: 

* The stock quotes are all live, via Google Finance. So just type in your Ticker and let it do the work
* Splits vanguard (or whatever broker you use for retirement) investments up by Personal and IRA Accounts
* Sub categorizes each account by allocation (Bonds/Equities &amp; International/Domestic)
* Provides retirement account overview to quickly assess if you are within allocation
* If you are not within allocation, it tells you which stocks to Sell/Buy to regain allocation (i.e., ""Sell $6,300 of Domestic Equities"")

Although that is all fun, I'm sure you've seen spreadsheets with similar features. I wanted this to be truly lazy though, in the spirit of the lazy portfolio. Not something I have to physically check every few months (ugh, so much work). Now for my favorite part:

* The spreadsheet includes an overview page, that allows you to quickly see the day's performance
* More importantly, it also allows you to see how far off allocation your retirement accounts are, and automatically color codes it for more visibility (i.e., if you are out of allocation by 10%, it is red)
* We're still not lazy enough. Now for the standout feature I couldn't find anywhere else *drumroll*: **It will automatically send you an email alert if you're out of allocation by 10% or more** (see instructions below for more information). Never check the spreadsheet again!


*Instructions for use* 

First, make sure you copy this spreadsheet to your own google account (File -&gt; Make a Copy). If you don't see the File menu, make sure you are logged into your account. 
Once that's done, It's pretty straight forward, for the most part. Just change the ticker symbols &amp; shares owned to your actual holding and it will calculate the rest. Also, you will have to play with the allocation math, if the default allocation doesn't match your desired target. Feel free to reply with questions.  

The trickiest part is getting the email notifications to work. Follow these steps: 

1. Tools -&gt; Script Editor
2. Replace ENTERYOUREMAILHERE on line 11 with your email
3. If you want to change the threshold to trigger an email (its currently set at 10%), change that on line 7 (change the number after ""value&gt;="")
4. Save the script by hitting the save button
5. Run -&gt; Read Cell (allow authorization) 
6. Click the trigger button (its directly to the right of the cloud button and save button)
7. Set up a trigger 
8. It should be set up as readCell/Time-driven. I recommend choosing a day-timer, so it will check once a day and if you are off, send you an email once a day. (I made the mistake of initially setting up an minute timer and getting an email every minute for 6 hours. Whoops.)
9. Save. Now forget about it and go do something else! 



*Note:* Before anyone asks, these aren't my actual holdings or stocks so don't send me advice about how X is a terrible idea. I wish I owned TSLA. The holdings in this portfolio are purely a demo. 

Lastly, if anyone has any tweaks or recommendations for this, please let me know. Im still new to spreadsheets and figured out most of this over the weekend. 

**Edit:**

A lot of people have been reporting that the page is loading in a view-only mode that does not show the menus, or allow copying to your account. I *think* it's just getting overwhelmed by the amount of visitors, so be patient and try refreshing a few times, or try back again later. Also, make sure you are logged into your account. If anyone has any other ideas as to why its doing that, or how to fix it, please PM me! Sorry for the confusion!",617

15-04-19,"GILD Earnings - Why should go all in, no hesitations","Gild is the Apple of Pharma (current p/e of 13). 

Short term, GILD will make a lot of people very happy.

Upcoming earnings are scheduled for April 28th and here is why GILD will crush estimates:

Last quarter net earnings was 7,314,269 (billion) - this was based on average of 6500rx / week. 

Q1 should be in the range of 9-10,000 rx / week - based on information from around the web.

Based on these numbers alone, we should see at least $10,000,000 (billion) in revenue for Q1 2015.

Buybacks have not been taking place in the blackout period (5) weeks leading into earnings - GILD has 15billion in buybacks authorized and will happen sooner then later (price is only going higher). By September 2015, GILD stock should be at 150$.

Also, a lot of negative articles have come out in the past few weeks, to keep the price low and to allow positioning for the next leg up.

Their cash flow was slightly hampered by a high receivable $5,000,000 (billion+) but they mentioned in their earnings call that some of that should be coming in, this quarter.

120+ after earnings. Buy either the 105MAY15 or 110MAY15. I am betting 10k on this, once I see market direction sort itself out in the next couple of days. If you don't feel confident in the short term May's, consider the Junes. 

Do your own due diligence. 

EDIT - Looks like positive news from China +lower estimates on almost every company and earnings season + overly bearish sentiment about the market = We are going to rip the next couple of weeks.

**SPPR** I anticipating a weak open, Red to green move rip up over 3. Will be shorting parabolic moves and the back side of the move. Obviously if 3 does hold I will go short risking off that mark. 

**VLTC** I will just go short when the stock shows serious weakness with a lot of downside. Really have to trade this stock reactively. 

**GBSN** I would like to see a weak open, red to green move over 4.2. Now if the stock is not able to hold 4, I will short risking off that mark.

**CHOP** Will not die. I will only short a grinding move with a solid downtrend, similar to AMCN.

Before I do I plan to read all the recommended books and continue to lurk (I wont have the money to invest until ~September as I'm making an emergency fund in the meantime).

Let's not even get into Spanish 10 Year yields vs. US Treasury Notes, 1.44% vs. 1.87%, respectively.

THCZ Really began to parabolic in the last 2 days, only a matter of time before all these buyers become sellers. I will only be shorting parabolic moves or will join the trend on the downside. I really do think the peak is it soon (probably at .30). 

VLTC I am very close to ignoring this stock all together, however it has been a bit top heavy lately. I will only be joining the trend if the stock begins to fade off below 10. Be very careful of a parabolic above 10 because of a clear technical breakout. I am realistically not expecting this to fall until the 11-15 dollar range (I know it is a big spread but it is really difficult to tell how much higher this can go)

CHOP is really beginning to hold up at that 4 mark. As soon as this thing snaps it I will go short risking off the HODs and add into pops. Be very careful with this stock!

NVGN Just on watch for lateday fades, that is all. If the pattern sets up I will join the trend and get short.

NYMX Ran sooooo much on this: (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/nymox-announces-new-prostate-cancer-clinical-trial-results-2015-04-20?siteid=bigcharts&amp;dist=bigcharts). I will really be looking to get short if the stock begins to parabolic over the 2 mark. Be aware that the 1.75 mark acts as resistance so if it holds I will go short (more likely to breakout and really rip).

BIOC is a big former runner. Only looking to get short into a big parabolic rip in the morning. Also would love to join trend with the back side of the move (lower highs).

15-04-20,CABN is it the answer to graphene mass production?,"So stumbled upon this company and this looks like this may be a great gamble. They were a natural gas to liquid fuel business but last year pivoted to developing a mass scale production of graphene. If you don't know what graphene is please read up on it as it is likely the biggest push forward to nanotechnology.

They then partnered with the UC Santa Barbara to help develop this technology. In January they created a new company owned 50% by CABN and 50% by Kaustav Banerjee the director of Nanoelectronic research lab at UC Santa Barbara.

That said they are operating on debt and a pretty high amount of it but on April 7th they hired Dr. Rajeeva Lahri as a technical advisor who has had a strong presence in the semiconductor and solar industry. But he has an extensive background with venture capital.

With that background I will say again this still is a huge gamble as they didn't have anything yet. However having worked in a prestigious schools lab I've seen some of the great breakthroughs possible. With the creation of a company between CABN and Banerjee in January 2015 I'm lead to believe they have very early processes indicating success that will require refinement and scaling even more. With the current financial statements they are high in debt but if they can get the involment of venture capital they may have enough to produce the mass production of graphene process.

If they can do this coupled with the current expectations of they likely can either become one of the largest producers of graphene (if they are first to scale the production) or patent out their technology.

So this looks to me to be very high risk but possibly very high reward. The company is adjusting to the market demands and changing their business model. They seem to have the right people and the right idea it just comes down to the question of if they can executive that plan.

Anyone else have thoughts on them?

15-04-21,Round Lot vs. Odd Lot: Or How Many Shares Should a Beginner Buy?,"I graduated university almost 2 years ago now, got a good job that pays well and leaves me with a little extra money, and so recently, I decided to invest some of it. After researching a bit about investing and how it works I bought a few shares of various companies, but in small amounts, typically 4-5 shares. Recently, I read about there being a standard number of shares that investors usually purchase to facilitate easy reselling in the future, managing their investment by thinking of it in dollar amounts instead of number of shares, and a bunch of other reasons. That standard number of shares being 100.  I also discovered that I've been buying Odd Lots and that doing so may make selling these shares in the future more difficult. Now I'm wondering how many people actually actively purchase 100 shares or more per trade, and if so, are there any other benefits to doing so that I'm missing? If people really are buying 100 shares all the time investing seems off putting because all trades will be above $1,000 for any stock more than $10. There's always the option to save enough money to purchase the shares, but then the process of investing becomes slow and tedious. Does anyone else trade odd lots? What are your experiences?",0

15-04-20,Indexed Universal Life Insurance,"I am about to sign up for the above mentioned policy. For those that do not know what it is, it is a tax free investment vehicle where your gains are capped at about 20% a year, and your losses are capped at 0%. Also, there is no contribution limit like there is for a Roth, and the fees are significantly less than whole life insurance.

The catch, besides your gains being capped, is you are paying for a life insurance policy and hence the fees/premiums are how the company makes their money. However, after four years you do not have to pay the premiums anymore and your investments will still be recognized as tax free to the IRS. So you could pay in for four years and then sit on the money, tax free, until you decide to take it out.

The policy is a complement to your retirement accounts such as 401k's Roth's benefit plans. 

Note- there are article touting that the program is ascam, as the insurance premium increaes each year, however I am in my early 20's and am fairly certain this will not be a big issue for me as compared to someone starting the policy in their 50's.


Does anyone on this sub have a policy, if so, how has it worked out for you? Or better yet, am I completely wrong about this opportunity and misinterpreting the pros and cons?

For example, I'm doing some DD on a Brazilian company now and I noticed that I could only find their 10K for end-of-year 2014 in Portuguese, not in English. Also, they're scheduled to release a quarterly earnings statement in early May, and their website lists the date for the English release as one day later than the Portuguese version. For the record, this is a well-known, established company (market cap over 3B).

So basically what I'm asking is if I can use the language factor to give me an upper hand the same way people with experience in a certain field/industry use that to their advantage?

15-04-20,Super-Rich Investing in Classic Cars.,"The market for top classic cars is on fire at the moment, according to one leading dealer, Richard Biddulph. He sold a 1932 Bentley 8-litre for £870,000 and a 1912 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost for £650,000 at recent exhibition at Essen in Germany. It seems that the fortunes (or rather misfortunes) of the eurozone are responsible for driving rich investors into tangible luxury assets. As Mr Biddulph put it, ""There's a lot of nervousness right now, so people are buying these cars as place to put their money.""

According to Classic Car Auction Yearbook, the undisputed bible when it comes to classic car stats, sales of vehicles at the main auction houses reached $1.16 billion (£780 million) in 2014, that's up by around 50 per cent in just 12 months.

For example, a Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Gullwing has gone up from USD 167,000 to USD 1,443,000. And a 1955 Porsche 356 Speedster, chassis #80228, shows sale prices going up from USD 66,000 in 1998 to USD 280,000 last year.

This year’s frontrunner, the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO sold for USD 38,115,000. In fact, this sum would have been enough to buy every single Top Five car every year from 1993-94 to 1998-99 – and still leave a few million dollars spare.

**THCZ** Really began to parabolic in the last 2 days, only a matter of time before all these buyers become sellers. I will only be shorting parabolic moves or will join the trend on the downside. I really do think the peak is it soon (probably at .30). 

**VLTC** I am very close to ignoring this stock all together, however it has been a bit top heavy lately. I will only be joining the trend if the stock begins to fade off below 10. Be very careful of a parabolic above 10 because of a clear technical breakout. I am realistically not expecting this to fall until the 11-15 dollar range (I know it is a big spread but it is really difficult to tell how much higher this can go)

**CHOP** is really beginning to hold up at that 4 mark. As soon as this thing snaps it I will go short risking off the HODs and add into pops. Be very careful with this stock!

**NVGN** Just on watch for lateday fades, that is all. If the pattern sets up I will join the trend and get short.

I will really be looking to get short if the stock begins to parabolic over the 2 mark.

If you are just papertrading this is an excellent platform but keep in mind that the info will be delayed 20 minutes. If you have cash in your account, you can request the delay be taken off and they will do it. This is good for practicing a new strategy or for back testing. If you don't know what back testing is, look it up on Investopedia.

I click on the Marketwatch tab and then click on the GEAR symbol. That brings up a box that has a few selections. I select LOVERS AND LOSERS then it brings up another box and I select PRE-MARKET TRADING. Once the list populates, I sort it by price and see what's there to trade. I might refresh the list 50 times before 9:00 AM but I usually have my picks by then. I put them on my watchlist and if they are moving rapidly upwards, I buy. I don't go get coffee at this time.

I'm not sure if this is a widely known strategy (forgive me if it is), so I thought I'd see what I could find and I thought it was interesting. Link in Comments","I took 17 insurance stocks and tested their performance compared to the S&amp;P index. I recorded the share price at when the beginning month of the rates being raised and at the ending month when they stopped raising.

What I found was that when rates were raised by 4.25%(July 2004 to August 2006) and 3.23%(April 1988 to April 1989), those 17 insurance stocks beat the S&amp;P by 15.9%, and by themselves had an average return of approximately 30.6%

When the rates increased 3% in February of 1994 to March of 1995, my index of randomly picked insurance stocks outperformed the S&amp;P by 5.5%. The S&amp;P was kind of stagnant, only returning 5% in that time period, but Insurance stocks doubled that return. 

In July of 1999 to July of 2000, fund rates increased 1.74%. Insurance stocks did not out perform the S&amp;P in this time period, but I believe the data is skewed because of the tech crash that happened in March. You can look in the file and see if you want.

I do not have direct control over where the money goes, but I have some leverage and can influence the people making the desicions like no other, and also make my own decisions with some discretion. 

We work with 5 different private banking firms and I meet with each of them to get a view of how to build our portfolio.

So all of them showed us similar products from big investing houses, and we proceeded to buy some shares in those funds.

15-04-20,Questions about DCF analysis,"Hey guys, I have been trying to learn discounted cash flow analysis and I am wondering if people here more well versed in DCF can clarify some points with me (I will probably have a lot of other questions too).

1. The WACC calculations require a number for risk free rate. Is there a standard number people use? People say to use US treasury yields for the risk free rate but which one (6 month, 1 year, 10 year, 30 years)? Should I use current yields or historical average yields (again, which maturity length)? What percentage have you guys been using?

2. I have the same question for the market risk premium. This should be the expected growth rate of the market but should I use historical returns or try to predict the growth rate of the market in the next 5 years? What percentage have you guys been using?

3. The example that I saw used 3.5% for the risk free rate and 9% for the expected market return. Therefore assuming a beta of .9, the cost of equity is: 3.5% + .9(9%-3.5%) = 8.45%. Are these numbers realistic? Because adjusting just 1% can change the intrinsic value of the stock by a lot. Is it better to err on the side of caution and use higher numbers?

4. I've been looking at real world examples of DCF as well. One of the stocks I looked is analyst coverage of LBIO, a biotech stock. The link below claims that Piper Jaffray put a price target of 21 based on DCF analysis. LBIO is a biotech stock that's still in clinical trial phase. How is reliable DCF analysis even possible on a stock like this? The company has zero revenue because it has no product out yet and is only receiving cash flow because of stock sales. How could an analyst do a DCF analysis on a company that has no product out for sale and is only in its trial phase?

I will give you guys the juicy bits:

&gt;Although you are referred to on the Prosper website as a “Lender,” you are not actually lending your money directly to Prosper borrowers, but are, instead, acting as an investor and making purchase commitments for Notes and purchasing Notes from Prosper, that are dependent for payment on payments we receive on borrower loans.

&gt;Loan Servicing fee: an annual rate of 1.0% of the outstanding principal balance of the borrower loan

&gt;Collection agency fee rate: 17%

&gt;Notes and returns on notes are not FDIC-insured and have no Prosper or band guarantee. Notes may lose value.

&gt;Notes purchased by prosper lenders are transferable only through the Folio Investing Note Trader platform.

Some basic stuff I think I know though; is to ignore the news and emotions. I saw a video of a trader saying he goes to sleep and prays for a recession which seemed counter intuitive, but the market always recovers, right?

So say Greece exit the euro and bring back the drachma. It would be a virtually worthless and I imagine even more confidence would be lost in Greece and Europe.

But in the long term (thinking 10 years+) could it be a good investment? A worthless currency should help to restore Greece's competitiveness, and with total control over their own monetary and fiscal policy they'll be able to start building up their economy again. However, I'm also aware that there are many, many factors that could equally cause Greece to stagnate and decline even further.

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/maEyAL0.jpg)

[Yes, I know how excessively, ridiculously risky this was/is. This was a speculative position, of course. I was aware of the triple-crotch punch of high fees, lack of dividends and natural decay from volatility cutting into the position. These are three very real negatives to holding daily tracking 3x etfs that everyone should be fully aware of. I consider myself very, very lucky to have not lost the entire investment and I do not recommend anyone do this with either SPXL or its inverse equivalent.]

As of today, it has risen ~386% to $340,623.90, paper gain of $270,526.94. I was curious how I would have fared holding SPY instead, which tracks the S&amp;P 500 with no leverage. SPY closed at $111.26 when I bought BGU/SPXL, so that would have been just about 630 shares. SPY closed at $209.60 today, so current value would have been $132,048. [edit: that's accounting for splits and reverse splits, yes]

SPY has also paid approximately $16.52 in quarterly dividends per share since.

$16.52*630=$10,407.60+$132,048=$142,455.60. Minus my basis, that's $72,358.64 in pre-tax gains from my what-if SPY position. 

$270,526.94 in SPXL gains divided by $72,358.64 means my SPXL position performed 3.7 times better than if I purchased SPY.

So what have I learned

1. 3.7x more gains is shocking to me, I assumed it would be 2x more when accounting for no dividends and decay. I guess the lack of volatility in the current bull market since 2010 amplified things better than expected? I don't know.

2. I'm still not convinced 3x etfs are a viable, long-term ""investment"" at all. I've been lucky to have held the position during the steepest, uninterrupted bull market ever. More volatility would have decayed me shares into nothing, I'm thoroughly convinced of this.

2. It's time for me to cash in my chips. SPXL has grown into the largest holding in my portfolio and I'd like to be rid of the stress from watching it whipsaw from day to day.",16

15-04-22,Quandary on $f (Ford),"I had invested into $f back in mid february when they were floating around high $15 range. As a relatively novice investor, I felt it would be a safe investment to make with promising returns. 

How did I come to this conclusion?

It wasn't an empirical decision. 

First, I had gained confidence being swayed by various articles online, heralding Ford as a great buy that is greatly undervalued. 

I held skeptical, until I saw more articles touting the same from WSJ, SeekingAlpha, etc. 

Then I saw the ratings from several investment firms, and they too seemed to have a good rating for the company. Of course, I had thought to myself ""I'm a novice at investing, these guys dedicate their lives to it, surely they must be on to something"". So I let that justify investing into $f.

Finally, I thought about how long $f had been around and developed a survivorship bias. 

Due to all the reasons stated above I invested into $F looking to hold on to it for a long time as a dividend stock. 

The above-said justifications are truly piss-poor for buying into a stock in hindsight. Granted, buying $F is not the worst I could have done. 

I do not know the basics of fundamental analysis beyond looking at P/E and P/S numbers and simple earnings reports. Honestly, I am not quite sure if it was a good buy. 

Ever since my purchase in Feb, the company has been truly lackluster. 

I read up on promising articles about how they are investing billions into foreign plants (India, Russia, and Mexico), but I am not too sure what to make of it.

I hear of the success in the F150 sales and the popularity of the Licoln line. This raises up some hope in the next earnings report, but find the market manifest little to no expectations of $F.

I find myself in a quandary with my position on $F. 

My history in getting into $F is laughable, a person with little expertise should just invest in index or etf for diversification. 

I still read up on positive reviews of $f by various articles, but the prices have very little to show for their raving reviews. 

I decided to go to /r/investing to hear their 2-cents on the stock. 

Do you own stocks in $F? 

If so why did you invest in $F or why did you choose not to?

What are your expectations of $F?

Do you believe the stock is overvalued or overvalued?

How long do you plan on holding $F?

Do you plan on buying into $F in the near future? Why or why not?",8

15-04-22,"TIL Hillary Clinton turned $1,000 into $100,000 trading cattle futures","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Rodham_cattle_futures_controversy

In 1978 and 1979, lawyer and First Lady of Arkansas Hillary Rodham engaged in a series of trades of cattle futures contracts. Her initial $1,000 investment had generated nearly $100,000 when she stopped trading after ten months. In 1994, after Hillary Rodham Clinton had become First Lady of the United States, the trading became the subject of considerable controversy regarding the likelihood of such a spectacular rate of return, possible conflict of interest, and allegations of disguised bribery, allegations that Clinton strongly denied. There were no official investigations of the trading and Clinton was never charged with any wrongdoing.


Rodham later wrote that she educated herself about the market and followed it closely, winning and losing money. By January 1979, she was up $26,000; but later, she would lose $16,000 in a single trade. At one point she owed in excess of $100,000 to Refco as part of covering losses, but no margin calls were made by Refco against her. Near the end of the trading, Blair correctly sold short and gave her a $40,000 gain in one afternoon. In July 1979, once she became pregnant with Chelsea Clinton, ""I lost my nerve for gambling [and] walked away from the table $100,000 ahead.""",492

Some basic stuff I think I know though; is to ignore the news and emotions. I saw a video of a trader saying he goes to sleep and prays for a recession which seemed counter intuitive, but the market always recovers, right?


So say Greece exit the euro and bring back the drachma. It would be a virtually worthless and I imagine even more confidence would be lost in Greece and Europe.


But in the long term (thinking 10 years+) could it be a good investment? A worthless currency should help to restore Greece's competitiveness, and with total control over their own monetary and fiscal policy they'll be able to start building up their economy again.

My hope is to eventually evaluate the Fear and Greed Index as a trading signal. However, I don't want to rely on the hacky scraping of a chart from CNN.com. I'd like to recreate the Fear and Greed Index with a combination of Quantopian's price data and easy to access external data sources.

While I feel like I am on the right track, many parts my home made index could certainly be improved. I could use some help finding the best way to equally weight all the metrics and account for the components' past values (as CNN does). Right now I am using rolling z-scores with decay.

""Vancouver, British Columbia, April 20, 2015 -- Cannabix Technologies Inc. (CSE: BLO) (OTC PINK: BLOZF), developer of a hand-held Cannabix Marijuana Breathalyzer for law enforcement and the workplace, is pleased to report the release of the first publicly available images of its marijuana breathalyzer Alpha prototype and an updated video presentation of its Cannabix Marijuana Breathalyzer. Media files and video that show the design and features of the prototype are available for online viewing at cannabixtechnologies.com.

The Alpha prototype images will also be showcased at the Marijuana Investor Summit and Business Expo (http://www.marijuanainvestorsummit.com) on April 21-22, 2015 in Denver, Colorado, at Booth 308.  The Alpha device testing is well underway with medical marijuana users. The objective of the testing is to maximize THC sensitivity, detection and reliability of the device for use as a roadside or workplace drug impairment tool. The Company is developing a Beta version for trial testing with external organizations.
  
Kal Malhi, President of Cannabix Technologies stated, “We have made good progress with our internal testing of the Alpha version of the marijuana breathalyzer prototype. In particular, we have been working to optimize breath flow mechanics in the device by testing a range of different materials and air chamber designs. There have been significant changes in the look and design of the device since our first engineered renderings; we expect this to continue as we work on developing our Beta version. We look forward to meeting investors, media, government officials and industry participants in Denver.”",3

Observations:  
1. Many here at Investing are relative newcomers to the field. Certainly, a site such as Reddit can provide newcomers with unique perspectives in the securities market. 

2. Many of the considered speculative stocks are indeed trendy, such as Apple, Ali Baba, even Bitcoin.  

3. Interestingly, Apple was considered the riskiest - and safest - stock by some in the survey.  This would probably be a good future question to ask in June the Q2 survey. 

4. Researching on securities to most is a part-time activity. This makes sense, seeing as how a lot of people work and have social lives, and thus have little time to research. 

5. For the most part, returns collectively are positive

6. People hate hidden fees, interest rates, Brokerage firms that do not offer low-cost index funds. People love index funds, low fees, historical data. 

7. Reddit is split between a preference towards value and growth stocks.

8. Optimism is afoot here, although it is unknown where the market will be five years from now.  

9. Reddit is divided when it comes to allocation of net worth towards investments.  

10. Reddit also is divided on whether or not one can effectively beat the market in returns.

Market sell: sell at the current market price

Limit: Minimum amount willing to receive per share. Again, not sure. 

Stop Loss: Price below the current price that converts your oder to a market order. So if I have a stock at $10, and I want to sell it if it gets below $8, if I set this to $8, it will automatically sell it?

NFL Teams have 2 Preseason Games, 8 Regular Season Games, and (Hopefully) a playoff game or 2.

Assuming 8% seller fees on eBay is my 'Break even point', I could easily see each ticket going for 10%+ of Face Value.  

What are the risks with this?  Is there anything I'm overlooking?

The day oil reached it's 5 year low I purchased a couple thousand in UCO shares and it has done very well for me. 40% ish return in the last month alone. I am pretty excited about these oil ETF's and have been looking at UWTI which is a triple weighed ETF. Right now it is trading in the low-mid 3.00 range but has been trading at over $40 dollars as little as a year ago. 

I firmly believe that oil is bound to recover at some point. It always does. What is the catch however? I know if it seems too good to be true it usually is. Why wouldn't everyone be buying these if there is so much potential for reward? Can somebody explain this to me?",3

&gt; A financial trader who played the world’s futures markets from a small suburban house in Hounslow, west London, has been arrested and faces extradition to the US after supposedly making $40m (£27m) for his alleged role in the so-called “flash crash” of 2010.

&gt; The US Department of Justice (DoJ) said on Tuesday that it was seeking the extradition of Navinder Singh Sarao, 37, who it claims “spoofed” financial markets using commercially available trading software to place $200m of false trades from his home in Hounslow. 


&gt; “On numerous occasions between at least in or about April 2010 and in or about April 2014, Sarao spoofed the market and manipulated the intra-day price for … S&amp;P 500 futures contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, including on or about 6 May 2010, when the US stock markets plunged dramatically in a matter of minutes in an event that came to be known as the ‘Flash Crash’.”

&gt; The DoJ added: “By allegedly placing multiple, simultaneous, large-volume sell orders at different price points – a technique known as ‘layering’ – Sarao created the appearance of substantial supply in the market … When prices fell as a result of this activity, Sarao allegedly sold futures contracts only to buy them back at a lower price.”

""[2010 Flash Crash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Flash_Crash) was a United States stock market crash on Thursday May 6, 2010, in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged about 1,000 points (about 9%), most within minutes, only to recover a large part of the loss. It was the second largest point swing, at 1,010.14 points, and the biggest one-day point decline, 998.5 points, on an intraday basis in Dow Jones Industrial Average history.""

15-04-21,New foreign dividend tax and my brokers response...need help,"I am invested in MDT which recently inverted their headquarters to ireland. Apparently ireland taxes dividends by 20%, except in the case of the inversion US residents are exempt from the dividend tax. I was recently paid my first dividend for MDT after the inversion and noticed that this 20% tax was passed through to me. I questioned my broker (sharebuilder) as to why I was being taxed even though I'm a US resident and this was their response:

""It looks like we were charged foreign tax by Pershing, who receives the payment information from the depository. There have not been any reversals or adjustments made to our account indicating this was processed incorrectly. Pershing (our 3rd party company who we use to process) does not keep track of resident status of all our individual customers exempt from this fee.""

So....what can I do? Obviously taking a 20% reduction in my payout is not good for me especially when I'm supposed to be exempt. How should I approach this with my broker?",1

This past week I have been very surprised by CSX's random swings – it took a giant hit down to 31.80 post-earnings (which were actually fairly good) and then the next day it swung up to 35.

Today it went back down to 34, but Intraday its now up big again to 35.50.

I don't really mind, I mean it is going up and I am holding for long term, but I would certainly like to know what is going on.  

My opinion is that there is a big buyer in the market – most likely a takeover bid of some kind.  This seems unlikely due to the nature of the business however, especially considering CSX is solely being targeted and not NSC or UNP.

Thanks for any insight.",2

FAirly new to this game, so hoping someone can help with some terms.. I've searched google first off, but it didn't help me all that much, having someone to bounce questions off is a nicer place to be.

I've got a small amount of cash in a company called Novogen (listed on the asx as NRT.ax and NASDAQ as NVGN).

They've treated me well, I was in at an average of 18c per share, and sold my initial investment at 42c .. keeping hold of 2/3 of my shares.  So I'm in the ride with virtually no risk ..

Last night they had a trading halt, and listed a notice that diluted shares from mid 40c to 30c.  They were short on funds to take their cancer drugs to trial, so needed to raise some capital.  This bit I understand somewhat.

What followed was a notice to all exisiting shareholders advising of 2 sets of options.  A 6 month option of 30c per share, and a 5 year option of 40c per share.

The notice can be found here :

http://hotcopper.com.au/threads/ann-novogen-announces-rights-offering-and-private-placement.2499486/#.VTamdCGeDGc

I get the feeling that I should be purchasing some more shares now and then additional shares are offered to me later at this same price - I really think this company will continue to rise in the mid term, but not sure how I am supposed to take advantage ..

Can anyone ensure I'm thinking along the right track?

15-04-21,The Best Short Indicators on the Market,"We all know penny stocks are dangerous to buy. People pump penny stocks, forcing them to rise without reason. This creates a highly unstable environment, and the ONLY thing that is certain is the fall of the stock. So my thought has always been, why participate, and most likely lose, in the pump, when I can far more easily get into the almost guaranteed dump? With this idea in mind I went to work thinking of a basic screener that I could use to capture over-bought penny stocks and simulate what would happen in the event they were purchased, or shorted. After a little playing around I came up with a very basic screen.

This screen, though extremely basic provides many of the aspects I, or anyone else, would look for in a penny stock they intended to short.

**Close &lt; 5**

This is simply stating that last closing price of the stock is under $5.

**(average(Volume X Close) within 20 days) &gt; 1m**

In order for you to be able to short a stock someone must hold a long position in a margin account somewhere. This line not only helps to assure someone is holding shares in their account for you to borrow, it also increases your chances of actually having your order filled when you go to sell it, or buy it back. No one wants to be left holding worthless shares. And you don't want to be in a completely iliquid position.

**Change of close over 5 days &gt; 50**

This is the kicker. Basically, this line only picks companies whose stock price over the last five days has risen by 50% or more. Now, the charts below are even more dramatic the higher you make this number. However, they weren't as aesthetically appealing as there was a lot of time where you would simply be waiting for that one stock to sky rocket that also fit the other two parameters in our list. 

**So how did it do?**

Wonderful! If you short the stocks that follow these guidelines you can and most likely will make a lot of money. However, if you buy according to these guidelines you lose your money... all of your money. 

So I can't post pictures on here so I wasn't able to put any of the graphs in this post. I've linked the article we released on our website below. The article itself doesn't provide any more content, but it does give you a chance to look at the graphs and get a better grasp on how well/poorly the strategy does.

15-04-21,WDHR,"Prologue: I know this is a shit stock. Please do not tell me how awful of a stock this is. I am aware.

About a week ago I put some money into WDHR at .0001 out of boredom. I haven't had time to actively participate in trading recently, but I thought this might get pumped before 4/20. It's currently at .00001 (yes, four zeros). Just curious if there are any brokers that let you trade that low? I'm aware that most people would not be able to set a limit order that low so placing a bid there is kind of pointless. Just wondering if anyone has ever come across quadruple zeros like this?

15-04-21,US citizen going to receive shares in a OTC stock in the London Stock exchange.,"I purchased shares of a foreign  private investment company in bitcoins over a year ago that at the start of this year was converted to shares and I am have copies as a registered member. I was just informed that the company will be going public on the London stock exchange AIM market. Shares will be allocated as a pre-ipo member and will be available to trade once they ipo (so long as they get to that point but anticipated for July 2015). 

Currently I use Charles Schwab and have only used a self managed 401k to trade so I wanted to see those from the US that have traded AIM stock on the London stock exchange and their experience with it. I see Charles Schwab has a global account but wanted to verify that this was required to trade in the London exchange. 

Is there a better company to use for this type of trading? Any major considerations I need to take being a US citizens trading on a foreign market? 

(disclaimer: I'm aware of the risk level I took by investing in a bitcoin investment fund so please do not comment regarding that. I was aware of the chance they would run off with the money)

15-04-22,Two UK-listed oil services companies that you should avoid at all cost and it might surprise you,"Petrofac used to be a company, with a strong balance sheet. But in the last two to three years its fundamentals have deteriorated where it needs to raise money. 

Don't be fooled by the £900m reported in its cash balance plus amount, taking account of the debt, it runs a net debt position of £400m. 
Compare that to 2008 (the last time oil and gas infrastructure faced a decline in spending), it has run a net cash position of £384m. 
Therefore, I believe the financial position of Petrofac have worsened if it wasn’t for the generosities of its suppliers. 

Back in 2006, trade payables was running at 18.6% of revenue; now it accounts for 43% of revenue. Suppliers will eventually get rough on Petrofac, and demands quicker payments if not, they too will struggle to survive financially. 

If we hypothesize that Petrofac’s trade payables should account for only 20%, then the company would have spent £922m to pay back suppliers. 
If Petrofac were to pay back £922m, then the cash balance would have disappeared, and the need to raise more debt or equity is imminent. 

On the asset side, Petrofac has not been as conservative in its revenue recognition, as trade receivables jumped from a conservative 18.1% of revenue in 2006 to a liberal 45% of revenue. 
And with oil prices falling by 50%, we should expect some of Petrofac’s clients to struggle paying back what it owes!! 
Don’t be surprised if they report write-downs in its trade receivables, as well as writing down more of its non-current assets. 
Petrofac’s share price
Back in 2008, despite the strong balance sheet Petrofac commands, the shares fell by 60% plus. However, once recovery took shape in the oil market, Petrofac’s shares went from £2.70/share to £18/share in 2011. 

Even with the shares currently trading around £9/share, Petrofac’s shares will come under pressure for the rest of 2015 and early 2016. 
Add in the weak fundamentals and the desperate needs to raise the cash I won’t be surprised if the shares trade around the £3.50/share level. 

My second surprise is the newly form company called AMEC Forester Wheeler (AMFW). 
AMEC recently took over Forester Wheeler back in early 2014 for £2bn. 
The results for 2014 were a tad disappointed as pre-tax profits fell to £155m, down 39%, due to an exceptional charge of £98m. 
When AMEC bought Forester Wheeler, they were paying a valuation measured at 30 to 40 times, in terms of P/E and Price to free cash flow. And ridiculously, it happened when oil was trading around $100/barrel!

The market currently has given AMEC Forester Wheeler the benefit of the doubt, as its shares fell 27% from July 2014’s peak. 
U.S. oil services majors Baker Hughes and Halliburton has fared much worse when capital spending in the oil and gas sector falls by 35% in 2008/09. The feat expects to repeat in 2015/16, and at a similar magnitude. 
I expect AMEC Forester Wheeler to fare no different, if not worse, given its deteriorating financial position. The shares should fall by 50% in the next 12 months at around £4.50/share (it currently trades around £9.50/share). 
Management in AMEC Forester Wheeler did put some spin, by saying they will get an extra boost of £150m in revenue if the U.S. Dollar remains strong. And has targeted £125m in synergies savings to be made. 
However, 2015 should see further write-downs from AMEC, and that should negate any benefit coming from the business. 

Disclaimer 
Currently, I do not hold any positions in Petrofac and AMEC Forester Wheeler.

The revenue, profits and the price of these shares seems to have been rising rapidly in the last few years though I've read that they seem to be massively overvaluing the company. Additionally, the major downside of this scheme is that because it's not on the stock market you can only sell your shares through Asset Match in an auction once a year.

15-04-22,"Your opinions on private wealth management, and at what point should one seek professional advice, and in what form.","Hey Reddit,

I'm recently married, and have always managed my own finances and investments.  I work in the financial services, but I have more of an economist background and don't manage money professionally, so I understand the theory and math very well, and like to think I've done a pretty good job with my portfolio, retirement accounts, and tax management over the past decade or so. 

My wife has more money than I do, specifically a trust fund managed by a private wealth management team at a global financial institution.  My initial reaction is that the PWM people are most likely a bunch of thieves and clowns, and we need to move the money as far away from them as possible.  

Our financial situation is not complicated.  I understand our liabilities, and am pretty sure I know what a portfolio to meet those goals should look like (save for long term, maybe buy property in a few years, be ready for potential expenses of having a kid).

So my questions is, what can these PWM people do for me that justifies the expenses?  And if I did need professional advice, what would the expensive and extremely conflicted  (because of their fee structure) PWM people do for me better than a fee-only CFP plus a capable accountant?  

Am I missing anything?  Are there rich people tricks that PWM has access to that us regular people don't?  One thought was asset classes, but I think it's probably dumb for an amateur to dabble in that.

Anyway guys, your thoughts?  Thanks a lot.",2

15-04-22,"I deal well with emotions regarding my system, reading numbers right and placing trades, but the wait for a target or stop fill just kills me. Why?","Greetings and success to you. Your feedback is welcomed on this thread of thought regarding emotion in trading. Scalping, specifically. 

As an e-mini futures scalper, my goal is to take two points out of the market by trading once every trading day, excluding days before market holidays and a few weeks in late December when I unplug completely to recharge. That sounded funny now that I read it back, but it is true. Anyhow...

Prior to going live, my system had proven effective in back-testing with conservative fills (price printing past my target or just touching my stop), and my charts/platform setup are as simplified as I can make them (one chart, one indicator, one DOM). I am trading the system live now, with the success rate I anticipated. I was taught how to set up my trading desk to maximize peace and minimize distractions. I work out, eat breakfast and shower before I trade, to be fully alert and up for a few hours before trading. 

My philosophy of managing emotions in trading is to simply be patient and wait for my setup to come to me which is about 80% of trading days, then enter at the system-identified price and set my target and stop orders. I have minimal stress in doing all that. I have read in this subreddit and elsewhere that most traders have anxiety in questioning their system and entering their orders because of the heat on their keyboard (sim traders will not understand). Well, I have no such anxiety, because to me it's just reading number accurately and then pushing buttons to match those numbers. I do that all day long at my job on Microsoft Excel, so I really am not affected by that process. I just follow instructions of my system. That's not the problem...

My anxiety comes AFTER I enter orders. I know the worst thing for me is to sit there and watch the chart, so I don't. I did my job, the orders are in, and now comes the wait to see what the market does. Any honest trader will tell you they don't know what it will do now, but they expect it to go in their direction. So, there is no benefit served by watching the candles go up and down. That's why I created my system! And no, I am not tempted to adjust target or stop for market conditions. I leave it alone 100%. My anxiety comes after I minimize the chart and DOM, leaving only the platform control screen visible, showing the two orders still waiting for a fill or a cancel, via OCO. THAT is what gets to me, and I don't know why.

I would love to turn off the computer and walk away to live the rest of my day, but I learned many moons ago that brokers and platforms are imperfect and must be babysat. So, all that to say this... how do YOU deal with trader emotions AFTER the trade is on?",4

15-04-23,"This sub doesn't seem to have much advice for people investing in a limited time frame, what advice would you give for short term &lt;5 year time frame","The best advice I've heard in this sub is to dollar cost average most of your money into slow growth, safe dividend stocks and ETFs. I think most people give this advice under the assumption that you're working with a relatively indefinite time frame (ie retirement or to build generational wealth). 

This is great advice but I don't think it addresses people who are trying to save in anticipation of spending the money fairly soon. I, for example, am in my mid-20s and have a decent paying corporate job. I put enough money in my 401K to get my full employer match so I'm not really worried about retirement right now (I'll start putting more in the closer I get to retirement). Aside from my emergency fund and a little spare change I hold in savings, most of my money (around 20K) is in a Vanguard account mostly invested in ETFs. I anticipate spending most of this money in the next few years. My plan is to buy a house soon and most of that money will be used for the downpayment. 

Dollar cost averaging makes sense over my 40+ year working life because barring a catastrophe the market will go up but it may be a bad idea in the short term. Someone who started investing in an ETF which tracked the S&amp;P in 2000 would have made a net loss by 2005 for example.

So what kind of investment vehicles and advice would you give for someone trying to invest money they plan to use fairly soon?

15-04-23,Peabody Energy (BTU) just fell down another shaft at $4.50 and may die down there.,"When Peabody Energy (BTU) one day in February, 2011 (the red vertical line on the chart), signed an agreement to ship coal to China through the yet-to-be-built Gateway Pacific Terminal in Bellingham, WA, touting jobs, jobs, jobs and running newspaper ads shouting how everyone was in favor the project (a lie as it turned out since almost no one was), the company probably did not know it was signing its death warrant but while the death-spiral is still unfolding, it is becoming more and more evident that is what it was doing.

Probably had no choice with the competition from fracking-cheap natural gas and rising renewable alternatives more and more often displacing coal in electrical generation at home but could not they see the West Coast wall they were about slam into? Talk about corporate mismanagement -- betting the company on trying to ship coal through the heart of environmentalism in the era of climate change? That's like invading a hostile foreign country and believing the local populace will throw flowers instead of IEDs.

The stock is down 92 percent from that day in 2011. There will likely be spats of short covering every so often now and again, and Peabody is going to have eat their last cash on buybacks to defend the stock and it might hold in here for a while, but at under five dollars, the investment risk (and me thinks the likely outcome of this epic fall) remains the loss of all shareholder equity.  Needless to say every investor must do their own due diligence before investing in anything, especially 
BTU, since as I said the risk here is actually **ALL** shareholder equity.

P.S. The last time I visited this subreddit arguing that $14 was a critical level for the stock (and so it was), some guy here was arguing that the company had plenty of liquidity so I was full of it.  I suggested he just watch the headlines.  Well, there have been headlines -- exploring asset sales, bond yield rising on risk, that sort of thing, and the incoming CEO has actually offered to take a compensation cut of 10% (big of him with the stock knocking on death's door). When was the last time that happened anywhere?  Facetiously, I have to ask could it be there's not enough money left to pay him anyway?

P.P.S. BTU has come out with its latest earnings.  Here's a summary of that **[NOT GOOD NEWS](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3096926-a-look-at-peabody-energys-first-quarter-results)**.

15-04-22,ForceField Chairman Accused of Using Backroom Promoters to Boost Stock Price,"Trading in ForceField Energy Inc.’s (NASDAQ: FNRG) stock was halted Monday morning after falling 22 percent at 10:21 a.m. The New York-based LED lighting company told investors in a regulatory filing Monday that Richard St-Julien, founder and majority shareholder, was arrested on Friday and had resigned as chairman.

In a press release on Tuesday morning, the SEC announced that trading in ForceField shares would be suspended until at least May 5. The SEC suspended trading in shares, ""due to concerns about the adequacy and accuracy of information available to investors concerning the funding of recent articles and promotions touting [the company].""

The SEC press release came on the heels of a Monday release from the Department of Justice that said St. Julien was arrested for securities fraud in Florida as he was attempting to board a flight to Costa Rica.

According to the criminal complaint, “since approximately August 2012 until April 2015, St. Julien and his co-conspirators engaged in a scheme to manipulate the price and trading volume of ForceField’s stock by using undisclosed nominee accounts, including an account held by a dermatologist in Boulder, Colorado, to purchase and sell the stock, and through the use of stock promoters and broker dealers who failed to disclose to potential investors that they had been paid by St. Julien to promote the purchase of the stock. St. Julien did not disclose his ownership and control of the shares purchased through nominees and used offshore banks, including in Belize, to pay the nominees to conceal his ownership and control. St. Julien coordinated the purchases by telephone and text messages.”

The DoJ says that “at the end of January 2015, St. Julien allegedly paid approximately $50,000 to a stock promoter through the dermatologist in Colorado. A few days later, the stock promoter began promoting the purchase of ForceField shares on its publicly available Facebook page, disclosing that his company had been paid $25,000 by an entity unrelated to St. Julien, or the dermatologist.”

Through his scheme, St. Julien and his co-conspirators deceived the investing public by creating the appearance of genuine trading volume and interest in ForceField’s stock, and as a result, from approximately January 2014 to April 2015, the price of the stock rose from a low of $4.55 per share to a high of $7.82 per share.

The company is also accused of failing to disclose that reports pumping its stock on the investor website SeekingAlpha.com were paid for by the firm.

The criminal case is U.S. v. St. Julien, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). The investor case is Atkinson v. ForceField Energy Inc., 1:15-cv-03020, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

15-04-22,Binary Options Trading | 80% Profit on Investment .,"Now binary trading options is the greatest way of investing online.
binary options are an exciting new type of investment. Rather than purchasing the asset itself, investors can speculate on which direction they estimate an asset will move in. 
When a BINARY OPTION is purchased on our platform, a contract is created which gives the buyer (known here as the investor) the right to buy an underlying asset at a fixed price, within a specified time frame with us, the seller.

Binaries are also known as all-or-nothing options, digital options, or Fixed Return Options (FROs), each name stressing the 0-1 nature of the options. This is because there are two possible outcomes to a binary option, both of which are understood by the investor prior to purchasing the option.

A BINARY OPTION TRADE on the anyoption™ platform may look something like this:
An investor purchases a Microsoft binary option for $100, with the opinion that at the end of the day Microsoft’s shares will be higher than they currently stand. If he is correct then we offer a 71% return on his investment.

Binary option outcome: 
1 - If at the end of the day, Microsoft is indeed higher than at the time the option was purchased, then we will pay the investor a $171 payout
0 - Should the shares be lower, then we will refund the investor $15

This means that when the contract is purchased, the investor knows that he will receive either $171 or $15. These values will obviously be much greater, the larger the investment.

15-04-24,PTBI DD,"All credit for this DD goes to Jbem777 from the ONCS google group. I'm in at 3.55.

Here is another stock I found that I think has HUGE potential. The float is very small so it’s hard to trade, but that also causes it to move fast with even the slightest bit of positive news. They have 3 major catalysts this year as well. They also already have 2 FDA approved drugs addressing a $2 billion dollar market. Just a year ago, it was trading at almost $30.

In short, they have upcoming catalysts, money in the bank from a recent financing, 2 FDA approved drugs, a pipeline addressing $17 billion dollar markets, and 99% institutional and insider ownership. Due to the small float, this sucker moves with even the slightest buying pressure. I will say, this is not a “trading stock.” The low float just doesn’t give it the liquidity, but when it moves, it goes fast. My plan it to hold through the catalyst and assess my position based on movement. I do plan on holding it a little longer because of the significant potential and huge insider/tute ownership.  

Share Price: $3.24

Market Cap: $64 million

Outstanding Shares: 19,998,801

Institutional Ownership: 28%

            Oracle Investment Management- 13%
            Perceptive Advisors- 6%
            Sabby Management- 5%
            Deerfield Management- 2%
            Soros Fund Management- 1.5%

Insider Ownership: 71%- This is not an error. Insiders own 71% of the company with the Chairman of the Board owning 13,125,024 shares.
 
With large tutes, including some very well-known investors (George Soros, Sabby, &amp; Deerfield), and huge insider ownership, the float is minuscule. Estimates vary, but from what I have found, the float is less than 2 million.
 
Float: 1,630,000
 
Finances: They recently completed a financing in December for 3.5 million shares at $4 and warrants at $5. It currently trading well under the recent offering price and there has not been any negative news. They also did a private placement with another large institution, Knoll Capital on 4/2/15 for 1,666,667 shares @ $3.
 

Upcoming Catalysts:

Commercial Launch of Mugard sometime in 2015. This has already been FDA approved and distribution agreements have already been made. Addresses a $2 billion dollar market.
 
SDF Alpha Data release 1H 2015- This is a more efficient method of extracting plasma from blood. This product is likely to be FDA approved in 2016/2017 and addresses a $15 billion dollar market.
 
SDF Validation, characterization, and IND filing 2015
 

Pipeline:

They already have 2 FDA approved drugs: MuGard for oral Mucositis and Proctigard for Radiation Proctitis. The market opportunity for these two drugs alone is $2 billion. Any sales figures or launches will create a nice bump. Even the smallest catalysts produce significant moves because of the low float.

MuGard™ is a viscous, mucoadhesive rinse which provides a protective coating to the oral mucosa. MuGard has received marketing allowance in the United States under a 510(k) from the Food and Drug Administration, and a CE Mark in Europe. The approved indication for MuGard in the US is “the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis (that may be caused by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) and all types of oral wounds (mouth sores and injuries), including aphthous ulcers/canker sores and traumatic ulcers, such as those caused by oral surgery or ill-fitting dentures or braces”.

ProctiGard™ is a treatment for rectal mucositis, a debilitating oncology side effect. ProctiGard received 510(K) FDA clearance in July 2014. Access currently holds global commercialization rights for ProctiGard.

Plasma-derived Therapeutics

Plasma biologics are bio-pharmaceutical proteins extracted, purified, and formulated from human blood plasma by the use of biotechnological processing techniques including precipitation, diafiltration, affinity chromatography, and ion-exchange chromatography. These products are rendered virus-safe by means of chemical treatment, nanofiltration, and pasteurization. The US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) exercises rigorous control of plasma collection to assure its safety.

PlasmaTech utilizes its Optimized Plasma Process™ (OPP) – a patented method short two-step optimized salt precipitation process, in contrast to the highly denaturing Cohn process to extract a wide range of therapeutically useful biologic proteins from human blood plasma. OPP enables the production of unusually high yields of these proteins compared with the Cohn process. Plasma biologics primarily address indications arising from genetic deficiencies which are increasingly being identified by means of newly available rapid and low cost diagnostic genetic tests. 
 
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (“AAT”): Also known as alpha-1 protease inhibitor (A1PI), is a protease inhibitor that protects tissues from enzymes produced by inflammatory cells, especially neutrophil elastase. Its normal concentration in human plasma is 1.8 to 3.5 grams per liter. The PlasmaTech Process recovers at least 70% of it, about 10 times that currently yielded from the Cohn process.  AAT Deficiency is a genetic condition resulting in damage to lung, liver, and pancreatic tissues, with pulmonary emphysema being the most common indication. Approximately 1 in 3,000 Caucasians suffer from the genetic deficiency, with over 150,000 people in North America and Europe living with the deficiency. Treatment involves lifelong weekly injections of AAT of at least 60 mg/Kg of body weight, or about 200 grams per year. Less than 5% of the treatable worldwide population receive AAT therapy.

AAT also exerts immunomodulatory as well as anti-viral and anti-bacterial effects independent of protease inhibition. Administration of AAT in non-deficient individuals may interfere with disease progression in the following conditions: Diabetes (Type 1 and 2), acute myocardial infarction, inflammatory bowel disease, cystic fibrosis, graft vs. host disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, vasculitis, organ transplantation, and multiple sclerosis. The number of new potential therapeutic indications for AAT could create supply problems due to the challenge of producing sufficient quantities using current plasma extraction methods to meet the demand created by the growing number of clinical indications. It is the view within the industry that the supply of AAT (without new indications) is currently nearing capacity. This factor underscores the significant relevance of PlasmaTech’s unique AAT yield increases.

I strongly suggest looking at the corporate presentation.

This stock has huge potential and due to the small float, it has been flying under the radar. The small float makes it hard to flip for pennies, but the potential is much greater than that. The company has solid management, is fully funded, and has a pipeline addressing $17 billion dollar market. 2 FDA approved drugs that will start creating revenue this year.

15-04-22,Timing the market when looking to buy?,"Over the past few weeks I have been extremely unlucky with my buys, I seem to always buy the day before the stock drops for no reason. No catalysts, no anything, the market just decides that the stocks ive chosen are worth 5-15% less than they used to be. 

for instance, I bought Opthotech at 57, the day before it dropped to 47 for no reason. Holding that one because im long 2-5 years, but it fucking sucks sitting on a 10% loss for so long (its at 51 range now). Bought XLRN at 37, it normally trades 40-42 range. the next day it drops to 33 on no news. finally got impatient and sold, switched to CALA at 14.5. Have to admit, that one was pretty stupid, i should have known it would keep dropping. 13 now. 

im very frustrated, i like all of these stocks long term but im losing a lot due to market timing. what advice can you guys give me when timing when to buy a stock? I usually look for catalysts and try to decide if I want in before or afterwards. I don't really believe in technical analysis but some things ive heard usually seem like good advice, such as dont try to catch a falling knife (CALA), so maybe there is something to it when deciding when to buy in. Is it just purely luck or did I make stupid mistakes?

My intention for Opthotech and Acceleron was to stay long for several years. I sold XLRN to try to trade CALA, I still think I can get a price above 17 or 18 within a few weeks. Thanks in advance for your advice",2

15-04-22,"I've been looking into Mad Catz lately... [rock band, guitar hero, EA, MCZ]","So I've been following MCZ lately because of the lucrative prospects of this exclusive agreement they have to build instruments for Harmonix' Rock Band due to release in the fall of this year. I'm a gamer, and, just from first hand interactions with friends and the general gaming community, everyone is looking forward to rock band much more than EA's guitar hero. Back in 2011/12 these games were huge, but MCZ was producing instruments for both GH and RB. With this new release of GH, EA announced that they will be using a new design for their guitars and they will not support other instruments. Everything seems to point to RB being the clear winner, but EA has tons of revenue. Does anyone think it's in the realm of possibility for EA to acquire MCZ? If so, couldn't they scratch the former agreement MCZ had with harmonix? I think that would completely gut Rock Band, and give GH an open field. With that being said, we are less than 6mo from release, and I don't know how likely this scenario is.

The alternative is a lot of time spent researching, operating and generally stressing about.
It is a matter of simple cost of opportunity: you are better off generating assets in a different way or just spending your time to enjoy life rather than speculating about stocks to make a big buck.

Professionals who do it for a living don't even beat the index funds a lot of the times as data shows.

15-04-22,Tesla (TSLA) Stock Rallying Today Following Positive Deutsche Bank Note. Up 6%,"NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Shares of Tesla Motors (TSLA - Get Report) are rallying, higher by 1.45% to $212.44 (now closer to 6%) in early market trading Wednesday, after analysts at Deutsche Bank issued a positive note on the electric car maker.

The firm said energy storage represents a ""significant"" opportunity for Tesla, while maintaining its ""buy"" rating with a price target of $245.

On April 30, the company is expected to announce the launch of its new battery storage systems for the home and commercial markets, powered by the same batteries in the Model S.

The firm noted that every SolarCity (SCTY) unit will be bundled with battery storage. Deutsche analysts estimate that equipping 50% of SolarCity customers could mean annual revenue of between $1.5 billion and $4.5 billion for Tesla.

Palo Alto, CA-based Tesla designs, develops, manufactures and sells electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. Tesla owns its sales and service network. (cont)

15-04-22,Stop Getting Your Investing Advice on Twitter,"There was an article in the Wall Street Journal this morning about people getting their investing advice on Twitter.  It is an interesting article, but a completely asinine idea for any investor to be getting their investing advice on Twitter.  You’ll lose your money if you do.

Talking stocks is always sexy.  Even when you don’t know what you’re doing, you can easily sound like the richest guy in the room.  Now, this totally crazy past time has made its way to social media and it is going to cost people lots of money.

Most small time investors have either money or time, but not both.  The first group of people are typically working a 9 to 5 job and trying to manage their personal wealth at the same time.  The other group is people with no real wealth who want to get rich quick.  I understand why people would get investing advice on Twitter, but you need to be smart about it.

Here are a few rules to keeping yourself safe as a small time investor.

1. NEVER buy stock advice – If the people who are selling you stock advice really knew what they were doing, they wouldn’t need to sell you anything.  If they were any good at picking stocks, they’d start a low fee fund and make their money on the carry.

2. Avoid frictional costs – A few common examples of frictional costs are management fees, subscriptions, and brokerage fees.  These all take away from your profits.  Getting investing advice on Twitter is free, but many of the people will want you to buy their “premium” picks.  That’s just an unneccessary frictional cost.

3. Bet long – Studies have shown that long term investing beats day trading hands down.  This is a great article that compares both, you can decide for yourself.  There are fewer frictional costs and volatility is reduced, yielding you a higher overall return.

4. Don’t follow the noise – The main subject of the article referenced above is Justin Pulitzer.  As of the writing of this post, he has posted investing advice on Twitter 72 times in the last 24 hours.  In the world of investing, less noise is always best.  Small time investors should never have more than 8 to 10 stocks.

5. A stock is not a person – If you think you might want to invest in Tesla (TSLA) start by reading their annual 10k.  Never invest in a company because someone has personified a company’s stock.  A stock represents ownership in the company and has no way of controlling it’s own action.  If someone tweets the following investing advice on Twitter; “TSLA is making an uphill run and she’s going to go through the roof” just ignore it for your own sake.  TSLA is not a person and has no control over where “she” is going.

6. Buy the business, not the chatter – People like me pray on people who trade on chatter.  If Blue Bell Ice Cream were a publicly traded company, I’d be looking to buy soon. This recall will have negative impact on a great business, creating a valuable position for entry. When Warren Buffett first went long on American Express, the stock had been nailed by the “salad oil crisis.”  He went to local restaurants and saw people still using their Amex cards.

The point is, buy the business and ignore everything else.  If you’re getting your investing advice on Twitter, you’d be best off to only use it to help you find ideas, then conduct ALL the research yourself.",1

15-04-22,THCZ,"So this company has gone from 1 cent all the way to 29 cents in the last 3 months.

Before all the anti-marijuana haters come in here bashing this stock let me just set it straight. I'm just ""interested"" in finding out more about this company whether it it's performance truly backs up it's stock performance.

#1. It's not REALLY a weed company. They have an energy drink that is 100% legal (no illegal substances in it) and all they are doing is capitalizing on the marijuana boom.

#2. They've signed some distribution deals including with Dr. Pepper.

Now I've tried asking around whether anyone has heard of Totally Hemp Crazy drinks before. Can't seem to find anyone from Colorado that has heard of them. Apparently they sold these drinks on Amazon recently and they sold like hot cakes.

#3. Their website is pretty nice and they do have a social media team.

#4. They signed a deal with the same marketing company that promoted Redbull and Monster

Now Monster Energy drink was once at .25 cents back 10 years ago or so. Could this be the next Monster? There obviously is a demand with this generation for energy drinks and they are using the popularity of marijuana as their brand.

Yahoo message boards are a bunch of trolls, but when I look at them for this company, everyone is overwhelmingly positive. Even those that say they shorted this feel that it could be a strong winner for even all the longs.

Anyone try these drinks or seen them? Still very skeptical, but this has peaked my interest with all the PR I've sen.",0

The company is doing fine and is able to payout these dividends through at least 2015.

I could have put some time in and done the calculation work myself but having been a longtime fan of vanguard, I figured they must be able to provide this dollar figure.

This was their reply:

&gt;There is not a place where you can see how much you've paid per year in fees by way of the expense ratio for your brokerage account nor your employer plans. Please note that expense ratios are taken on the fund level, not on the shareholder level. Therefore, there is no figure to represent fund expenses paid by an individual. More importantly, because these expenses are taken from the earnings before the dividends are paid, fund-level expenses are not tax deductible. Fund investors are taxed on the
net dividend after expenses, not the gross earnings.

I thought this was a cop out answer. I kinda expect more from Vanguard and hoped they would have a number ready rather than giving me the runaround. Obviously 0.18% is less than 0.50% but many of us, particularly those not reading this sub, need to see more than an expense ratio figure and an example based on $10k, they need to see dollar differences.

Do any other brokers provide such information? Or is it best to just do the calculations yourself?

15-04-24,Thoughts on PEGI?,"To start off,this is the first stock I've purchased back last November. I didn't do any research like I should have. Was just browsing the utilities and found it under renewable electricity. I thought wind power would be a great area to start investing, and the 5% dividend rate at the time pushed me to pull the trigger for 100 shares at $26.91.

The P/E is through the roof for a utility, but I suppose that's normal since the company has been purchasing wind farms all over the place and have several more under construction/planning. The source of my uncertainty is that I have been reading that solar has more potential for improvement in efficiency to cost than wind in the long term, and this company  seems like it is a small player in the renewable industry.

I'm up ~13% now, but I'm wondering if it is worth keeping long term now that I have had more time to look at it. ",2

All of their data corresponds to the Defense expenditures that have dropped 6.5% in 2014 to $610 billion which is a 20% decrease from 2010 levels.

What are your thoughts with their metrics and numbers and future forecasts for the company?

I think they are the best in class in terms of their technological position with radar, sonar, space sensors, and electronic warfare capabilities (land, air, and sea based). Their position within the cyber realm is expanding and they provide the bulk of advanced precision weaponry (missiles/torpedos) utilized during conflicts. 

I anticipate the reliance on their technologies to only grow as time moves forward and the military continues to modernize into a smaller and more efficient fighting force. ",4

Option 2: Could you just go to a portfolio of 100% equities and a smaller margin loan amount to get the same returns and same expected standard deviation? And not have to bear the interest cost. therefore getting a higher return for the standard deviation?

Will market movements affect the portfolio's differently?

I promise this isn't a homework post. 

Why does the stock market keep rising? I've done the topical googling, but I cant quite wrap my head around the issue. I'm approaching this mostly from the academic ""theoretical"" interest angle. 


The conventional wisdom of the day is mostly to park your retirement savings in total stock/total intl funds which implies that the market will always (or at least on average) grow, WHY?


Obviously, from a historical perspective this has been true, but as we know ""past returns don't forecast future results"". If this maxim holds true for our portfolios, why does it not hold true for the market as a whole?

15-04-23,Selling stocks,"Hello. I am an accounting student in my second semester of junior year. I have purchased some stocks/ etfs to hold long term. Something I'm not too familiar with is actually buying and selling the stocks. I purchased using limit, is that the best way? How does one go about selling stocks? Is there strategy that could result in you selling for a more favorable price?
Edit: I'm not planning on selling anytime soon. I want to know how to do it just in case.",1
15-04-23,How bad is my strategy?,"Total lamen here. Been doing this a few years now.

1. Every day I look at the market losers right at market open. 

2. I scan the list for any companies that had more than a 5% price drop overnight.

3. For each stock meeting that criteria I look at its Sabrient value score. If it was rated as undervalued before the price dropped I make a decision to buy.

4. I wait until around 10:10 AM when the panic sales tend to peak and buy anywhere from $500 to $1500 worth of the stock depending on how deeply it was cut and how risky I feel it is.

5. I sell as soon as the stock gives me about $10 to $30 of profit after my trade fees both ways. My logic with this is I sell when I've made some nickels and dimes While everyone else is hoping it climbs higher. I may not make as much as I could have by holding onto the stock but I'd also have the opportunity cost of my money tied up in one stock when I could have bought and sold many more in the time I waited for the price to rise.

I do not research these stocks at all other than trusting the analyst reports that they were undervalued BEFORE they plummeted and making sure the loss was sudden and not a gradual 52 week decline. 

I also LOVE product recalls, disasters, lawsuits, failed mergers etc because the market always overreacts Emotionally and eventually the otherwise profitable sound business will be back to normal. This is especially true if it's a moral outrage like an anti-gay CEO, etc. Eventually the public will forget and the superior company will rise again.

Basically I try to profit off the panic selling that happens.
 When a company misses earnings knowing that it always over corrects due to the panic... i.e. 7% drop will probably settle at 5% in a few days to a week.

I'm usually right... and if not I hold onto The stock until it bounces back. I NEVER sell at a loss, I hold until I recover at least my initial investment and trade fees. Sometimes this takes YEARs because I'm too stubborn to lose $40 but in that time I've usually earned enough in dividends to recoup my loss. Either way I'm currently operating at a net profit, though I don't know if that's from the market as a while improving the last few years.

I made $100 in the last 30 days doing this on about $1500 worth of money.

I've earned a steady side profit doing this for years but I've been limited by how many undervalued stocks plummeted. It doesn't happen every day.

To me it's not gambling because Unless the company y goes out of business I always have a chance to recover my losses even if it takes years.

Have I just been lucky? Am I an idiot? does anyone else do this?

I have no idea what I'm doing I just started playing one day.

15-04-23,Ditching Robo Advisors to capitalize on baby boomer trends,"So I'm ready to ditch the robo advisors and create my own lazy portfolio that I feel will achieve much better investment returns. After much research I selected a mix of six ETFs. I know that past performance is no guarantee of future performance, but the past performance for my selections is really incredible (and I mean average 262% 10-year growth vs. 80% growth for S&amp;P 500). It's weighted all in equities since I am still earning income through a job, adding to my investments each month, and do not plan to need any of these investments in the next 15+ years (already have my retirement and emergency savings funded). A key objective is for me to capitalize on the growth of the aged population as a percentage of the general population (e.g. through biotech, pharmaceuticals, healthcare). I'm sharing my proposed portfolio here so that you good folks may poke holes in my thinking or suggest alternative ETFs or other considerations I may be missing.

* [What Baby Boomers’ Retirement Means For the U.S. Economy](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-baby-boomers-retirement-means-for-the-u-s-economy/)


**PORTFOLIO SUMMARY**

1) 50% in US Stocks

* 20% large cap (QQQ)
* 20% small cap (VB)
* 10% energy (VDE)

2) 50% in ""baby boomer"" ETFs (capitalize off growing aged population as % of general population)

* 20% in biotech (IBB)
* 20% in pharmaceuticals (PJP)
* 10% in healthcare (FXH)

Please see table showing 10-year, 5-year performance as well as performance after the 2008 major market correction by [going here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0sLC_riifhNQmF0NHlVQW9FczA/view).


**HIGHLIGHTS**

* Ignoring bond funds and conservative ETFs but aggressively going 100% stocks since I do not intend to need any of these investment assets any time within the next 15+ years. I have ample retirement and emergency savings separate from my taxable investments and I expect that I could wait out any market corrections.
* Intentionally ignoring International stock and bond ETFs even though [most personal / robo advisors recommend them](http://www.etftrends.com/2015/04/why-it-is-a-good-time-to-consider-international-etfs/). I simply have not been impressed by their sustained long-term performance relative to these other options I've found
* Including energy ETF VDE since although historical returns have not necessarily been stellar, it seems to move independently from the wider market at times such as after the market correction of 2008 when it maintained very high positive returns though the rest of market tanked.
* The table shows that this selection of ETFs didn't get hit as dramatically as the wider market by the major market correction of 2008 and that they also recovered much better even just one year later (in March 2010)

I appreciate your reviews and comments so please poke away!


**UPDATE ON 5/19/15**
Thanks to all your review, help and discussion. I realized that there really are potential benefits to including allocation of international and potentially treasuries. But I also wanted to maintain a bet on the baby boomers segment. So here is where I ended up, which is much less risky than my original plan and should see much less volatility, though still may too risky for many of your taste. :)

* 20% - QQQ (large cap)
* 20% - VB (small caps)
* 15% - IXUS (international)
* 30% - ""Baby boomer ETFs"":
*  (10% IBB (biotech))
*  (10% PJP (pharmaceuticals))
*  (10% FXH (health care))
* 10% - VDE (energy)
* 5% - ZROZ (long-term treasuries)",2

Quick introduction about this worksheet I created: This is a strategy that I adapted out of an investing book that I have been reading, ""The Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing."" Essentially what the strategy is, is investing in an S&amp;P 500 ETF or mutual fund, monthly, ensuring your money will grow at XX% per month. So what I have chosen is for my investment in stock symbol, VOO, to grow at a rate of 1.5% per month for the remainder of XX-years. Now, what this strategy does, is it ""forces"" you to buy when VOO declines and ensures you sell when VOO increases. Since with ETFs you can't buy and sell portions of a stock, I have made my worksheet buy and sell whole number of stocks based on the monthly price. What I am struggling with is, say I wanted to add in an additional one-time investment of $X,XXX one month, how can I get this worksheet to adjust my monthly value accordingly. The orange cells are the input cells. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. The link to the worksheet can be found below:

Part of my success was diversification. My rules were 
1) only lend $50-100 max per loan 
2) only lend to borrowers asking for $2000 or less
3) only lend to borrowers who filled out every loan question on the survey
4) borrower must be employed
5) only invest in loans that have an interest rate higher than 25%

In the past two years, Prosper has made a lot of these requirements impossible. There are no loans that meet these requirements anymore, specifically #3 as they don't have borrowers fill out the questionnaire anymore. Loans are all for amounts over $10,000. Highest interest rates I can find are in the higher teens.

Turning a profit whether it is BINARY OPTIONS and/or any other type of method requires patience, determination, and a helping hand that can guide you in the right direction. Binary options can be targeted with the help of a quality, in-depth system that is able to assist with regards to pinpointing the right trades. The system being reviewed here goes by the name of ‘Binary Boom’ and holds substantial weight on the market as a potential game changer. Does it hold weight when it comes to looking past all marketing ploys put in place? This detailed review will highlight the pros and cons of this system and whether it is worth your time, effort, and money.

Is it Simple To Use?

When trading BINARY OPTIONS, it becomes essential to have a system that is simple to use. The user interface of this system is exceptional and wins hearts effective immediately. It is speedy, uncluttered, and downright easy to navigate. This is a great starting point for anyone diving into this investment opportunity, as a cluttered interface is a headache no one wishes to deal with.
It is not going to create hurdles before the trading begins as so many other options tend to do.

Is it Effective?

The claim made by ‘Binary Boom’ states its effectiveness at 82% when it comes to 60 second trades. Is this statistic a simple marketing gimmick looking to woo you in? Does it hold merit? Upon checking the system, it indeed does hold weight as the 60-second trades are easy to follow through on and it truly does provide the results it claims to.

It takes all of the risk out of BINARY OPTIONS or at least cuts down on it significantly. For most, this is the biggest hurdle and they help you overcome it.

How Fast can it be implemented?

How fast are the trades? How fast are the results? This is a system that can start bringing in results as soon as you get going. The broker on the other side helps you engage with the trades and complete these 60-second trades that are going to ensure you get to making money as you had hoped to.

Stop wasting time with solutions that require hours to complete. It is just not worth it to go with those options any longer. This system is easily the fastest solution when it comes to making viable trades.


Reduces Risk

What is the biggest challenge for anyone that is looking to get into BINARY OPTIONS? It is always the risk as with any investment out there. If you want a system that is going to reduce the risk and bring a bit of predictability to the investment, this is the system to go with.

It has been organized in a manner where the trades being made are not as speculative as you might believe them to be. It truly makes it easier to get the results you covet as fast as you covet them.

With the risk being reduced, it becomes simpler to go ahead and invest in BINARY OPTIONS.

Organized

This is an advantage that has to be highlighted. Organization is essential with systems of this nature and the reason for this is simple. An organized system is going to ensure you can focus on what is most important and that would be earning money with the trading of binary options.

Not only is the system easy to navigate (which it is), the system is also organized with regards to how the trades are laid out and how you can access them in order to complete the investment. It makes it easier for you to read into and digest as an investor.


Requires Patience

Patience is the name of the game when it comes to any type of investment and that can be perceived as a con. While this system is going to assist you along the way and will lay it all out on a silver platter, this does not mean you will start seeing millions pour into your accounts in seconds. It is not that simple.

The system works for those who are patient and still pride themselves on focusing on making the right investments. If you are patient, the results will come. If you are not, this system might end up looking difficult to manage.

15-04-24,Contrarian thoughts on LF?,"Leapfrog Enterprises -- This company's management is absolute garbage. They're pretty much running it into the ground, but I think there could be a potential upside to the investment from a contrarian standpoint.  1) They're currently trading at 63% of their P/B value, which is pretty attractive. 2) Their financials are pretty decent -- good amount of cash and **ZERO** debt (hence their very good current &amp; quick ratios).  

By no means am I saying they're a good investment for the long-term, but they've also been coming out with some new products like the LeapBand, which has solid ratings thus far.  I could see (from a contrarian standpoint) why someone would pick them up in hopes of a buyout from Hasbro or Mattel.

Here's what I've included so far:

1. **Get Asset Return** - Get's yearly return from asset first and current value.

2. **Get Asset Quantitative** - Get's the standard deviation, volatility, skewness, kurtosis, and drift of an asset's life.

3. **Get Asset Quantitative History** - Same information as above, except it gets it for every day of the asset's history of the trailing period days.

4. **Get Black Scholes Value** - Just calculates premium using Black Scholes Equation.

5. **Get Sharpe Ratio** - Calculates Sharpe Ratio of an asset/portfolio

6. **Get Future Return** - Gets expected return from PV, Interest Rate, and Years.

7.  **Get Mortgage Payment:** - Gets mortgage payment for term with IR.

8. **Get CAPM:** - Gets the CAPM return for asset.

9. **Get Bond Equivalent Yield:** - Gets equivalent yield of asset.

10. **Get Yield To Maturity:** - Get's yield to maturity of a bond.

11. **Get Zero Coupon Value:** - Get's value of a zero coupon bond from face value, yield, and time.

12. **Get Zero Coupon Yield:** - Same as above, but different.

13. **Get Yield To Worst:** - Yield to soonest callable date.

14. **Get Normal Distribution:** - Generates a Random Distribution with std. dev. and mean.

15. **Get Skewed Distribution:** - Generates a Skewed Distribution with skew, std. dev., and mean.

16. **Get Forward Value:** - Get the value of a forward contract depending on carrying costs, interest rates, time, and price.

17. **Get Perpetuity Value:** - Gets value along with yearly comparable worth valuations.

18. **Get Expected Value:** - Gets expected value from list of outcomes and probabilities.

19. **Get Mean, Median, Mode:** - what you'd expect...

20. **Get Percentile from Z-Score:** - Uses cumulative distribution function to get a percentile from a z-score.

15-04-23,Confused about my Mortgage vs Investment situation,"Hello, I am a 24 year old currently in a job which pays around 85k. I bought a house last year on which I owe about 223k on a 15 year term. I currently pay $2050 ( will drop $200 after refinance )which includes taxes, PMI and everything and my two roommates chip in $1200 combined. I want to have this as an investment property and will probably rent it out in a couple of years. On an average the rent for this place would be something around $1500 and I have seen the same homes go for more than $1600. The only debt that I currently have is a car loan for 15k at 1.49%.
As the rates have gone down, I am looking to refinance and I am thinking to do a 30 year and invest a part of it index funds. My company currently matches 3% no matter if I contribute or not and at the end of the year they do another 6-7% of my entire salary which comes around 7k in total for 401k. I have also maxed out my IRA for 2014 and will do the same for this year.
If I get married in few years I will most likely buy an another house and leave this a investment property. I am now really torn between refinancing this to a 30 yr vs 15 yr as I want to invest more for retirement. I understand going with 15 years will be somewhat risky as I will have an another house in few years but I will have a fully paid house in 15 years. If I go with 30 years I will have more cash flow and will be able to invest more and will be able to deal with any repairs/ no renters per a month etc. I am just not able to decide on anything and appreciate any advice/perspective.

15-04-23,"Anybody like TAN? I got in at 32 a share and it's been killing it for 1/2 a year. Thinking of buying more.","Here is why I'm bullish on Guggenheim's Solar TAN ETF.

2) China's new AIIB (Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank).  China is investing in all types of foreign infrastructure projects and I assume some of it will include Solar.  China is a huge PV manufacturer and TAN has several holdings that are Chinese PV companies

3) Not much reason to sell as we inch closer to grid parity and Oil prices remain unpredictable

4) Speaking of Oil... TAN kept going up even though Oil crashed... and we are likely going to hit an Oil bottom soon anyway.  If TAN can gain with low Oil, surely it will look attractive if Oil starts to creep back up again.

15-04-23,Building a concentrated portfolio - anyone thinking about such a strategy?,"My current portfolio consists of 15 stocks... I've had some winners here, and losers there. I'm dissatisified with my performance and want to rethink about how I pick stocks in general (started reading some books, started to learn about DCF valuation).

I've been toying with the idea of starting fresh by pooling all of my money together into a handful of stocks that I believe will outperform the S&amp;P 500 in the long term. These companies should:

1. Be an integral part of the American economy. Doesn't have to be a flashy company that's in the news all the time, but it does have to be a company that does something somewhat unique for the country. 
2. Possesses a huge economic moat in an industry that is difficult to break into. 
3. Pay a dividend.
4. Have a market cap of more than $10 billion.
5. Have positive earnings and positive operating cash flow.
6. Trade at an appealing valuation. 
7. Is in a relatively non-cyclical industry with solid growth prospects for the future.
8. Is not involved in the production of some commodity product or service.

From the top of my head, Visa is a stock I'm eyeing as part of this project, but I need to run through the numbers some more first. 

Now, I haven't started screening for stocks yet, but by my count, around 500 companies meet the financial criteria I've plugged into Finviz ($10 billion market cap, pays dividends, has positive net profit margin).

Once I have found my five or six stocks, I plan to go all in. I'll have the dividends reinvest themselves into more shares.

Has anyone ever pursued the strategy of a concentrated portfolio? Certainly, outsized gains are to be had, but if any of the companies I pick hiccup along the way, I could be in the red for the short term. ",4

The reason I ask is that I am currently 17 years old an lucky enough to have £1000 that I can invest with. I like the Bogle concept of investing for the very long term and not trading much. However, I've been looking at many investing sites, such as Fidelity; Charles Stanely; Nutmeg; Hargreaves Lansdown etc. and have found that they usually expect a minimum of £1000.

Should I be putting this into an ISA? Are the fees of an ISA worth the fact that they protect from tax? Is £1000 enough to start buying ETFs? Will the fees of buying and selling ETFs quickly eat away at my £1000? Where would you say is the most effective site to go and buy these ETFs with so little money?

15-04-23,Sell in May and September interest rate cuts,"Over the last 30 years, the 5 months between May and September have performed the worst of any months of the year. With that said, the only one of these months to average negative growth during this time period is September, and this is likely attributable to the 19% drop experienced in that month in 2008. With the analyst consensus for interest rate tightening set as September, the negative returns of September are likely to continue. Historically, it's paid to hold on to your stocks through these months and deal with the lower, yet positive, returns. This year may be different with the impending rate cuts. Do you think that the Fed will cut rates this September?

My opinion is no, due to the weak economic data for March (only 126,000 jobs added, Q1 GDP growth revised down to 0% by the Atlanta Fed) and the dovish character of the Fed chief, Dr. Yellen.

15-04-25,Momentum Daytrading Guide,"**Daytrade momentum specific intro:**
-
I short intraday. It is (in my opinion) the most fun style of trading. If i were you i would stay away from pennystocks until you have a good understanding of stockpromotion and short squeezes. If you want to do well in daytrading you should record each trade and write down where you want to get out of a stock (pretty much a mental stoploss).
Shorting intraday is not easy, you have to adapt and be ready to understand when to get into and out of a stock. Here is trade I made a few months back: http://i.imgur.com/aMU43pI.png?1 As you can see, I had gotten in with a set idea when I wanted to get out. I shorted because I felt the momentum has shifted and I looked for a opportunity to get in. This is in my opinion the most important aspect in a daytrader, having a plan.

**Research tools:**

And if i want to look for stock promotions to short:

http://stockreads.com/

http://stockpromoters.com/


**Brokers:**

* Interactive Brokers - great shorting list but has a lot of limitations such as starting with 10k.

* Etrade- decent short list, also has a lot of restrictions but you can start with less money and has a decent short list

* suretrader - bypasses pdt rule, has a good short list, but its platform blows. You would need to get das trader pro

* Center point- best broker for shorts but it costs a lot to start out, not a beginning broker

* robinhood- if you have literally no money and need to avoid commissions


**Platforms:**

* Das trader pro- my favorite but costs $50 a month, it is a nice platform

* thinkorswim- free platform and does the job just fine. Not as nice as das trader

* etrade pro- I have never used it but it seems like a cleaner version of tos

**And the scan i use (the basic version):** http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=311&amp;f=sh_curvol_o50,sh_price_u15,ta_highlow20d_nh,ta_perf2_d5o&amp;ta=0&amp;o=-volume , your choice to use it or not. Lots of traders would say ""ew those stocks suck"", i get the ones with the best setup to short. 


**Quick tip:**
When you start out, do not go in and immediatly trade. Paper trade first and record your trades, (don't lie about ur trades either, record the truth). Obvious learn all you can by reading books. Once you feel like you have a good understanding of daytrading then go ahead and try it with real money. Each trade you should get in with an idea where to cut losses and collect gains

Try to avoid doing the following when daytrading:
-

* You have no trading plan

* **You are blindly following others because they are experts** 

* No clue how to set a proper r/r

* ""Hope"" is part of your ""strategy""

* You average down on losers 

* You jump from one hot trading method to another hoping for ""the answer""

* Ask for stock picks

15-04-25,Your analysis template?,"Hi investors!

 For those of you who does your own analysis: What does your template look like? Mine looks something like the one below. If you think I'm missing something or have a comment, please post a reply! :)

 **Screening**

 This is not really a part of the analysis. It's just my starting point. If the company can't make it past the screening, it doesn't get analyzed. My screen is focussed on business metrics such as ROE, current ratio and D/E ratio. It contains some loose valuation parameters like PE &lt; 25, but I don't want to be too rough on the valuation parameters in the screening. I do my own valuation later on, and if the company is great but the valuation bad, I'll add it to my watchlist instead of buying it. 

 **Business**

 In this section I answer question such as: ""What drives the revenue?"", ""What does their business model look like?"", ""What are their plans for the future?"" etc. I also do a quick analysis of the management.

 **Numbers**

 In this section i dissect the financials. How much growth has there been? Why did this growth happen? What does the margins look like? Do they have a strong balance sheet? and so on. 

 **Competitive edge**

 A crucial category. I want some sort of competitive edge. If the firm doesn't have a nice competitive edge, I'll just move on to another company. 

 **Risks**

 What could hurt the firm? Any lawsuits coming up? Anything wrong with the business model? Any competitors coming out with better products in the next years? And so on.

 **Projections**

 Having a good understanding of the business, the numbers, the competitive edge and the risks, I move on to the financial projections. I limit myself to two years of projections. After that it gets too uncertain. I do the best job I can with the information available to me and I stay with conservative projections.

 **Valuation**

 I start out with a breakdown of the biggest competitors and then do a relative valuation. I continue with some sort of valuation model like a DDM, DCF or a DAOE depending on the situation. Most of the time I use a DAOE model. My inputs are conservative because the model builds on my conservative projections. Keeping the estimates conservative is key in a valuation model.  

 **Conclusion**

 If the company is good and cheap, I buy it. If it's good but not cheap, I add to my watchlist. If it's bad, I throw it in the garbage can. ",6

* Desperate investors seeking *any* yield at all are jumping head over heels into junk bonds. 


* They are not reading the fine print.


* Underwriters have taken away some long-standing protections.



This resulted in last year's investors getting decimated.

15-04-26,"Ok, someone school me on TASR!","So I'm a full time day trader/swing trader and I do a little mentoring on the side, and as an exercise with one of my students we decided to do a full fundamental analysis on TASR (he picked the stock and we just wanted something established, interesting, and domestic, no other reason for this particular pick really). 

That said, I started reading the annual report and was surprised because I've traded this company many times in the past but never really bothered to look into how legitimate they are. Are these guys like THE go-to company if your law enforcement agency wants to buy tasers? I also thought their integration with evidence.com and the whole body camera/android/iphone app/upload to website/store for evidence methodology was pretty cool. 

So I'm just curious what people who are more long term investors think of this company. It seems based on just the first few sections of their annual report that I've read that if anyone is going to benefit from more mandates for police to have body cameras, it will be this company. I haven't gotten to any of their financials yet but it appears on the surface that they're positive as they have positive net income, net tangible assets and also cash flow. I'm not really a fundamental guy, but I do know a good amount about company valuation and so this is one of the modules I teach but my student and I are actually using this exercise to improve both of our understandings of fundamental analysis, hunting for red flags, and the like. 

So anyway I was just curious what people think of Taser. To me they seem like a pretty cool company, well established, legitimate and in a good position to benefit from legislation that would require the use of police body cameras. I can see a few red flags/risks right off the bat but I just wanted to get a discussion going since this isn't something I usually do and I'm really curious! 

Thanks!

15-04-24,[Noob ETF question?] Average price keeps increasing,"Hey guys,

I've been investing for over 2 years now and have been doing so quite successfully. However, I've always bought into individual shares and never an ETF before.

Last month I bought 8 units of ASE:VHT (Vanguard Health Care ETF). Every time I buy shares I get an Avg Price for the shares that I bought, which remains fixed as long as I don't buy any more at a later price.

Maybe I don't understand how ETFs are structured, but this avg. price has been increasing ever so slightly since. I bought it at an average of around $138 and now it's saying it's an Avg Price of $141.71. I'm 100% sure these prices keep changing.

I'm in the UK, so I bought it with GBP at an exchange rate of 0.673. Are these changes a result of the FX fluctuations? 'Cause even then it's quite confusing.

15-04-25,Is it worth buying stocks in different currencies and exchanges?,"I'm a beginner investor, just formulating my first portfolio.

I'd like to invest in 3D printing and robotic surgery equipment however I can't find any applicable companies on the London Stock Exchange but there are obviously plenty on the US exchanges. Is it worth using my UK based broker to buy stocks on the Nasdaq or NYSE? Or am I exposing myself to more expenses and more risk?

The way I see it, by buying a stock in USD, not only am I exposing myself to the risk of the company, but also the exchange rate. In addition to that, my broker may give me a terrible exchange rate both in purchase and sale. Advice needed.

The robotic surgery company i'm interested in is Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) but I haven't properly analysed the financials yet. There are about 5 3D printing firms (DDD, SSYS, VJET etc.) i'm looking at but again, haven't done the analysis. My timeframe for these investments is 5+ years.",9

15-04-26,Thinking about Tencent holdings HKG:0700,"So first off I am not a pro, but a little analysis.

I will be comparing with Facebook

User numbers put Facebook around 1.1 billion and QQ around 829 million

Facebook messenger has around 500 million users as does WeChat (Although personally I think WeChat is much better)

Around 90% of Facebook's revenue comes from Ads, whereas 90% of Tencent's comes from services.

48% of Facebook's revenue comes from N.America whereas 85% of Tencent comes from China. So this may present a growth problem.

Facebook has been growing at around 58%, mostly through mobile ads, but Tencent has been slow at around 38%.


So although growth and user base is questionable, I think that with them pushing mobile payments in China, the outlook is good.

So for a long time now I've been trying to find a portfolio tracker that works for my situation... I'm sure there are others in the same situation and I'm hoping I can get some suggestions. Need something that fulfills at least these requirements:

- automatic importing of my trades from Questrade
-automatic dividend tracking
- ability to track Canadian stocks as well (I'm Canadian)
- ideally some simple benchmarks (like how portfolio is doing vs S&amp;P)
- automatic calculation of ACB and obviously investment return
- some simple reporting (profit/loss, capital gains etc.) - in conjunction with ACB esp useful when filing taxes with the CRA (and I assume IRS as well)
-data stored online/accessible and has a mobile friendly view
-currency rate automatic tracking (when I bought at, sold at etc.) accurate at least to the dollar noon historic rate.

So far, I've tried the following here are some rough comments:

- google/Yahoo finance: pretty good trackers but no automatic or import of trades
- SigFig/personal capital/most other trackers - either doesn't support Canadian markets, or doesn't support auto import from questrade, most of the time I only see import options from fidelity, Wells Fargo, etc. 

Most also don't take into consideration FX

So far I've resorted to just making an excel spreadsheet that I have to manually import data. But I find it quickly spiralling out of hand.

So I was researching yesterday and there is a Questrade API. As a developer, I feel this pain bad enough to consider actually writing a webapp that will satisfy those requirements.

There are probably other features that are helpful  as well if you guys have suggestions.

So basically two main questions:

1) am I missing something? Or is there a platform out there that already satisfies my situation

2) if not, is there anyone else in the same boat that would use this app if I set down the path of making one? (Would love lots of feedback here)

If anyone is interested, I'm doing some further research on this, please help fill out this survey :) https://laterolabs.typeform.com/to/ksLQbV

Thanks!

15-04-26,Guide To Momentum Pennystock Trading,"**Daytrade momentum specific intro:**
-
I short intraday. It is (in my opinion) the most fun style of trading. If i were you i would stay away from pennystocks until you have a good understanding of stockpromotion and short squeezes. If you want to do well in daytrading you should record each trade and write down where you want to get out of a stock (pretty much a mental stoploss).
Shorting intraday is not easy, you have to adapt and be ready to understand when to get into and out of a stock. Here is trade I made a few months back: http://i.imgur.com/aMU43pI.png?1 As you can see, I had gotten in with a set idea when I wanted to get out. I shorted because I felt the momentum has shifted and I looked for a opportunity to get in. This is in my opinion the most important aspect in a daytrader, having a plan.

**Research tools:**

http://finviz.com/screener.ashx

http://finance.yahoo.com/

https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/gainers?e=US

http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/markets/screener.asp

http://busystock.com/earnings-calendar/

And if i want to look for stock promotions to short:

http://stockreads.com/

http://stockpromoters.com/


**Brokers:**

* Interactive Brokers - great shorting list but has a lot of limitations such as starting with 10k.

* Etrade- decent short list, also has a lot of restrictions but you can start with less money and has a decent short list

* suretrader - bypasses pdt rule, has a good short list, but its platform blows. You would need to get das trader pro

* Center point- best broker for shorts but it costs a lot to start out, not a beginning broker

* robinhood- if you have literally no money and need to avoid commissions


**Platforms:**

* Das trader pro- my favorite but costs $50 a month, it is a nice platform

* thinkorswim- free platform and does the job just fine. Not as nice as das trader

* etrade pro- I have never used it but it seems like a cleaner version of tos

**And the scan i use (the basic version):** http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=311&amp;f=sh_curvol_o50,sh_price_u15,ta_highlow20d_nh,ta_perf2_d5o&amp;ta=0&amp;o=-volume , your choice to use it or not. Lots of traders would say ""ew those stocks suck"", i get the ones with the best setup to short. I extremely rarely go long as you can see by my recent trades here: http://i.imgur.com/PX4EATH.png (NOTE: this is the last time I make my recent trades public.)




**Quick tip:**
When you start out, do not go in and immediatly trade. Paper trade first and record your trades, (don't lie about ur trades either, record the truth). Obvious learn all you can by reading books. Once you feel like you have a good understanding of daytrading then go ahead and try it with real money. Each trade you should get in with an idea where to cut losses and collect gains

Try to avoid doing the following when daytrading:
-

* You have no trading plan

* **You are blindly following others because they are experts** 

* No clue how to set a proper r/r

* ""Hope"" is part of your ""strategy""

* You average down on losers 

* You jump from one hot trading method to another hoping for ""the answer""

* Ask for stock picks

Lately, lots of attention has been brought to wealth inequality via movements like Occupy, and fast food workers' strikes across the country. Companies like Starbucks have made news by offering college tuition, while some, like Wal-Mart and McDonald's have been pressured to raise wages across the board. There was recently a small credit card processing company whose CEO cut his own pay to up the salaries of all his employees to or above 70,000 a year.

I think this pressure for better wages and incentives will persist and grow in the future, and that those companies already moving towards this goal will fare better than the ones that lag behind.

* Expected demand of $5.2 trillion in new airplanes over next 20 years
* Defense business slowly growing out from US reliance, now 30%
* Defense business worth nearly $3 trillion over next decade

Recent share price drop after earnings result due mostly to a large decrease in operating cash flow. Yet cash flow is always very low in Q1 and annual flow still healthy at over $9b. Guidance for 2015 still in check. I see many people suggesting LMT here - BA offers an entry into the defence industry as well as the more stable commercial airline industry.

Can anyone point me to previous sector ETF launches and the effects (or lack thereof) they had on individual stocks? Thanks!",4

I have some money I want to put in the market, rather than just leave in a savings account.

I know it doesn't matter in the long run, but I'm most likely going to need this money in 2-3 years. So I'm looking to buy index funds in markets I feel are undervalued. I'm thinking parts of Europe. 

That being said, I want to make an informed decision, and want to know where I can find a ton of info on ETFs in general, on measuring country risk, the impact certain political events may have on the market (specifically which events would cause the market to overreact), etc.

Have 6 months emergency fund in checking so that's not a problem either. I take about $200-$400 per month and put it in to a high yield savings account (Ally). Have about $1500 in there currently 2 Questions: 1. At what point, or dollar amount, should I convert this savings in to an investment that will yield more than the .99% that Ally offers? 2. Is it better to take that money and put in to investment account I currently have? Or, put it in to a Roth IRA where I can max out the $5,500 annual allotment?

With that said, they still move a decent number of stock and before the failure they were sitting at $35. I've tried to look at their financials, but frankly most of it is still mumbo jumbo to me.

15-04-27,May start investing in Nigeria... could you evaluate my train of thought?,"Just wanted to run this by you guys for some advice. Here is what I have been thinking:

1: Nigeria has quite a large population and a Nigerian index fund is one of the better ways to invest in Nigeria and Africa as a whole.

2: I imagine they will grow quite a bit over the next 20+ years. It seems they went through a quick boom and bust cycle due to oil in the late 70's/early 80's. Is it just going through another ""boom"" cycle now that may end soon, especially with the social unrest and lower oil prices? The market fell over 50% but maybe the opportunity to buy is now?

3: This I just found out today... Nigeria's GDP is $500 billion + while the 200 stocks traded on the Nigerian Stock Exchange have a total market cap of about $80 billion. Compare this to the US with a GDP of lets say $17 trillion and a market cap for just the S and P 500 of $19.5 trillion. From this comparison alone it seems like the market has plenty of room to run. Should i be looking at a comparison like this?

4: Nigerias GDP has grown massively over the last 15 years.... multiplying by about 8. What factors other than social unrest could cause this to stop?

Thanks everyone - I am young and can take on some more risk and have have been lucky on some other investments, but is there anything else I should consider? I am looking to buy and hold for the long term, or at least until a point where the market looks massively overbought which i believe can happen often in smaller markets.",1

In turn, veterans of the market respond by saying 'do more research', to which I can only echo the sentiment. 

I'm here to ask: WHERE should beginners 'begin'? Do we begin by reading all the stickies (for relativity's sake) and continuing to learn how the market works, BEFORE dipping our toes in? Should we dip our toes in WHILST learning? What should we learn FIRST? Is it goal dependent and thus relative to each investor's desire?

15-04-28,Bronte Capital - Investors’ Letter for March 2015,"ChiNext is a NASDAQ style exchange attached to the Shenzhen stock exchange - but with lower listing standards. It is also the hottest stock exchange in the world - with almost every stock chart looking hyperbolic.

We met a local fund manager who assured us that careful research suggested that 40 percent of the companies listed on the exchange literally did not exist. [This is like the Chinese reverse mergers in the USA in 2011.]

That did not worry them though: “we have the other 60 percent to choose from”.

We went to visit a small Chinese investment bank which had listed in Hong Kong a company we believed to be fraudulent.

We grilled them for a while and concluded we were correct. Okay - no surprise there. So we grilled them about other companies they listed - and worked out they were all frauds. 100 percent of them.

Moreover they worked out that we knew what they were doing. But this did not end the meeting. They asked us to describe our business, how many clients we had, what we invested in. Then they offered us something we will never forget. If we buy their issues they would kick back half the money (your money dear clients) to us under the table. From their perspective any new source of victim money was a good source - even if it had a 50 percent charge.

It’s when you get to the third tier cities that it becomes comical. We went to one - about 120 kilometers from Guangzhou mainly with the intent of looking at the (idle) factories of listed companies we might short. We drove through 20 kilometers of idle factories - mostly originally built to manufacture auto parts.

And when we were finished we visited some property developers. One beckoned us with a giant Roman Style viaduct with Greek statutes on it. Inside were perfectly manicured gardens with thousands of Spanish style villas - all vacant - all locked with U-bolt bicycle locks. We got to the central-sales office which will - one day when this is a functioning community - be the town center.

We asked how many of the villas were sold (about 80 percent though we are not sure whether to believe them). We asked whether they had kept their value on resale - but they assured us that none had ever been sold in a secondary market. We asked if any were rented and what their rental yield was - but none had ever been rented.We asked how many were occupied - and they answered about 20 percent but extensive searching failed to find any that were occupied. The U-Bolts were ubiquitous.

The properties were properly delusional, with no public transport and nowhere to park your car. We asked where the car parks were and the sales office told us they would dig these out later. [The giant model of the development contained no car parking.]

The absence of car parks or transport made us wonder whether they were even built with the intention of ever being occupied.

Anyone interested should check it out [here](http://www.investopedia.com/university/options/).

Now to my confusion - I could not understand the [example](http://www.investopedia.com/university/options/option2.asp) used in the tutorial. Summary below for those who don't wanna click the link: 

The Tequila stock is currently trades at $67. A call option is offered for $3.15 with a strike price of $70. Three weeks later, the stock price is $78. Now according to the example, it says the option price has now increased along with the stock price, and is now worth $8.25. I'm very confused as to how the option is worth $8.25, and not $8.00, since $78 - $70 = $8.

If you post something and someone posts something that conflicts with your way of thinking, that is not a reason to report it to the mods. This is Reddit. People are supposed to use this as a forum to debate different ideas. I have made it perfectly clear that I do not like OTC's. However, who am I to say that OTC's are bad for someone else. If they work for /u/pennystockking then good on him. Shorting is not my thing but /u/badbaseball likes that so good on him. I like scalping but I have had others who say it's risky and they don't like it. Well, for my style of trading, it works. So, please, for the love of all that is holy, stop reporting people who disagree with you. 

Also, personal attacks. It is not a secret that there are some conflicting personalities in this sub. I am sure I rub some people the wrong way at times. Some of you have taken that to the next level and gone pro. Let's be adults here and stop with the personal attacks.

Lastly, maybe some posters should read their posts before they click the submit button. Make sure they are edifying and informative and not condescending (that means talking down to) and negative. I do not want this forum to turn into a battle royale of differing opinions but a good, solid forum for debate and education.

15-04-27,My adviser suggests I switch from ETFs to mutual funds. Opinions?,"Recently my wife and I have been meeting with a financial planner to ensure we're operating efficiently and protected with the right insurances, etc.


We've both had Roth IRAs for 5+ years, in addition to some more recent 401ks. Our IRAs are self-managed, and a mixture of standard ETFs (IVV, IWM, VWO, BND, etc.) nothing exotic. Our financial adviser recommended switching to mutual funds from Franklin Templeton, demonstrating that while we'd pay an upfront percentage, a portfolio with similar FT mutual funds would have performed slightly better over the past 5 or so years. The charts looked good, and both IRAs would have been worth about 10-15% more presently had we used those mutual funds instead.



I started reading about investing for retirement in 2008, pre-recession. I was extremely interested in it. Most stuff I read recommended not to use mutual funds because of the increased cost and because the performance of fund managers is never guaranteed. As a result, I've never used mutual funds.



After seeing this recommendation, however, I can't deny that the accounts would have been worth more now had we used what my adviser is suggesting. I assume he'd make a commission on this, and I know that 5 years of time isn't enough to ""prove"" that one strategy will always be better than another. At the same time it's hard to argue with the charts that I've seen.




**TL;DR** I'm on the fence about whether to switch my IRA from broad market ETFs to the Franklin Templeton mutual funds that my financial planner suggests, even though the funds seem to outperform my current accounts. Can someone provide me with reasons why or why not to switch? I'm not looking for someone to ""advise me"" via reddit, rather just provide some perspective on this issue I might not be considering.

15-04-28,AMCN: Why you Should Short It.,"Last week I posted the beginnings of a short penny stock screener. Since I ran the screen for the first time the other day, I’ve been looking into the top company spit out by that screen, AMCN. AMCN, or AirMedia group is a digital media network in China that is dedicated to air travel advertising. Over the past few weeks the company has gotten good press again and again as they won an exclusive contract with the Shanghai Railway Bureau, and sold 5% of its equity to Shenzen Liantronics. This is all great news, however, a stock can only go up so much for so long based solely on good press. Nonetheless, at first I thought my screener was false and spitting out bad results. Of course, that is until I actually looked into AirMedia.


AMCN has jumped over 100% since April 1st. This would be great, and not unusual for a company with such a low price, if the company was bought out or had any strong fundamentals whatsoever. Instead, we have a company with horrid fundamentals that simply lucked into a few pieces of good news right after another. Let’s take a deeper look. 


First, how did I find AMCN? It’s a fairly obscure company based out of China and is traded on the Nasdaq. Did I spend hours scouring the deepest corners of the stock market? No! Instead I created a simple screen that scoured the market for me using Equities Lab.  


When I ran this last week and wrote my article AMCN was one of the only stocks that fit the profile in the entire market. This being an extremely basic screener that I created more to make a point rather than to use as an investment tool I was surprised that any results were returned at all on that particular day. So I dug in. Looking at the chart I knew this screener spit out some of the most short worthy stocks I’ve ever seen and the fact that I now had an opportunity to capitalize on this screener excited me a little bit. Let’s dive into actually analyzing AMCN and make a final decision of whether or not to short it.  

The Synopsis  Tear Sheet is one of the easiest Tear Sheets to understand in the Equities Lab platform, and it still produces a lot of information any fundamental investor would need when analyzing whether or not to buy or sell a stock. Personally, the first thing that catches my eye is the fact that AirMedia has a Piotroski score of 0. 

Looking at the chart over the past year we can see that the Piotroski score has fluctuated from a high of around 3 to the current low of 0. Now, for those of you who are unfamiliar with the Piotroski Score, it is a score from 0-9 that looks at 9 different financial criteria to see whether or not a stock, particularly stocks grouped under the “value” category, are worth buying. The higher the score, the better the buy.

So the chart is only looking at the stock for one year. What happens if I look at the chart since 2007 when AirMedia actually went public? Maybe it’s a long term gainer. Maybe it has spikes like this often and they just build on one another over time. 

…Nope. I’m trying to stay positive about this stock but it keeps insisting on digging its own grave. It also looks like spikes like this one have happened since mid 2012, each a little bigger than the last. However, they all end the same way… with the stock dropping back down to a reasonable level. 

So all of the indicators are pointing towards a hard SHORT…or at least sell. If you got into this position at the beginning of the month kudos to you as you’ve just doubled your money in a matter of days, but get out now. No where that I looked could I find any indication that this stock was going to continue to increase in value.

**Disclaimer**
Now, do remember I’m just a guy behind a computer screen with a really cool piece of software. Take what I say as a grain of salt because I’m just here for your amusement. I don’t have any certification and I’m not providing any actual investment advice.

15-04-28,Security Exchange commissions in Europe,"We have seen all over the place all these new financial regulated entities, those brokers that have coplied to the requirements of the European Security Exchange commissions. However, we see that most of them (the new ones) are getting regulated through CySEC (Cyprus Security Exchange Commission) although CySEC was well known not long ago for being a tax haven, however taxes in Cyprus have increased since the crisis times and even though they remain lower than in other European countries it is true that they are paid. Thus, once could believe that this is one of the reasons why so many financial entities have come to be incorporated to Cyprus, low taxes for companies that want to declare millions in revenue monthly. It is not all that encouraging to do it in other countries such as the UK despite the fact that there is a far more reputated Security Exchange Commission as it is the FSA. Does Cysec guarantee a good quality level of compliance and security for the investors? one could say ""yes"" because there is an Investor Compensation Fund and companies are also being sued for misconduct. However, I doubt that it is as strict as the AMF or the FSA or la Comisión de Valores...
When it comes to choosing a broker, watching out for the regulatory environment is extremely important because it shows that your funds will be backed up by a transparent (or at least declared as transparent) organisation. When you are new to investing you not only need to check how to invest , investment tips, financial news etc. there are plenty of websites that do that for you such as fininconsulting, dailyfx, investing com etc. You need to check a list of best rated brokers in those websites, read their offers and requirements and check the regulatory scope.",8

With reports that the revenue and net income of Netflix, essential for a growth stock such as this particular, increased to substantial levels, many purchased shares in the company, thereby pushing 

Lost in all of the mania that seems to befall institutional investors and their individual clients is that, while it is true that the company has grown in the past decade, the rapidity of the stock has grown at an even faster rate, propelling the stock to levels not seen since the days of AOL and Yahoo a generation prior.  If the price had grown at a modest pace, investing long-term into Netflix would have been a sound and rational move.  However, at the current price of $571.55, as of April 17, 2015, the value of Netflix is too high.  

To start, it is important to note that in the world of investing, nearly any stock is worth some sort of price.  The question most investors should ask in a two-part process is: what is the value of the company, and is the current price trading at a bargain of the value?  

Currently, as of April 18, 2015, the share price of Netflix was $571.55.  With an earnings of $4.32, the P/E ratio of Netflix was 132.30, an astonishing number in a comparatively high, but modest (compared to 1999), market. With a book value per share of 30.75, the P/B ratio of Netflix was 18.10.  From the get go, compared to the S&amp;P 500, which possesses a P/E ratio of 20.34, and a P/B ratio of 2.82, Netflix is an overvalued stock.  It is true that in the short-run, Netflix may seem like an undervalued stock due to the market’s psychological need for purchasing shares of technology stocks during times of economic boom.  However, as a long-term stock, the purchasing price currently imposed to potential investors is one that is too high.  

To start with, rather than establishing a monopoly over other technologies, thereby increasing the worth of the brand, Netflix is becoming more-and-more dependent on other technologies and brands, thereby putting the blossoming companies life in the hands of other, more advantageous, ones.  

Gradually, as time went on, more-and-more emphasis was placed on streaming over DVD-by-mail membership services. In the 2014 10-K of Netflix, the company reported a decrease in American DVD revenues, stemming from a 16 percent decrease in DVD paid memberships.  Interestingly enough – one that should raise a red flag for investors – is that despite a clear decrease in the revenues of DVD membership, the company added $71.49 million in amortization of DVD content library, compared to $71.33 million in 2013. While it is sensible that amortization of streaming content library increased in 2014 compared to 2013, this was due to an increase in subscribers for the streaming section of Netflix. 

Ironically, one of the boasting points behind Netflix and their rising stock, one involving additional cash, hurts the company due to the method to which they obtain said monetary funds. In the 2014 10-K, Netflix reported that they earned an additional $408.1 million compared to 2013 ($1.6085 billion in 2014 vs. $1.2004 billion in 2013).  At first, this sounds astonishing considering that Netflix in 2012 possessed $748.1 million in cash.  In other words, in a mere two full years of business, Netflix was able to double their cash holdings.  However, during these two years, Netflix issued heavy debt in the form of convertible bonds and high-yield fixed income notes.  By issuing 8.5 percent bonds, Netflix issued corporate bonds on par with amounts one can generally expect from casino companies.  While Netflix has additional cash, the same company also has additional debt, which must be paid off through either interest or conversion into common stock.  

With regards to short-term investments, Netflix is also hurting their long-term value of current assets. Netflix has $111.76 million in money-market funds and $3.6 million in CD’s, ones that could potentially yield a lower rate than the U.S. interest rate.  In other words, once Netflix pulls out their money from a money market fund, they will find that said money is worth less than when they put their money in the fund.  Netflix has $295.50 million in corporate bonds, and $168.75 million in Government bonds.  Although these bring higher-yield than money market funds and CD’s, many of the corporate bonds fail to have a steady risk-to-return ratio; and in the case of American Government bonds, while the risk is lower, so is the return.  

It is important for Netflix to use their short-term cash because in their 2014 10-K, Netflix announced that they had a negative cash flow of $126.70 million.  Compared to 2013, Netflix in 2014 lost $81.3 million in cash from operating activities due to attempting to purchasing content for their subscribers.  Further hampered by purchasing $69.72 million in property and equipment, Netflix in 2014 had a Non-GAAP FCF of -$126.70 million. In other words, Netflix has no spare money to pay off future debts from the bonds that the company has issued out in recent years.  This puts Netflix in a pickle. Since Netflix does not have any cash to expand, it must issue debt.   However, while in the short-term, Netflix has cash to expand internationally and domestically, it must pay off their debt with future cash flow.  This is problematic, since Netflix does not have any positive cash flow.  Thus, to survive, Netflix must incur further debt through bonds in order to expand and pay off past debt.  Netflix has plans to pay $9.8 billion in future streaming content through money that is non-existent.  

The situation involving negative cash flow brings up a delicate situation for Netflix.  The streaming-media giant is one that uses Amazon Web Services in order to receive essential services, such as data processing, storage capabilities, and cloud computing software and hardware.  In order for Netflix to switch over to their own home-grown service, the company would have to temporarily suspend operations since their entire operations involves computing systems.  This creates a snowball effect of losing customers, revenue, net income, share price, and market capitalization. Furthermore, by depending on a rival streaming service for the maintenance of their service, it would be equivalent to RCA (Radio) depending on Consolidated Edison (ED) towards the development of radio stations during the 1920’s, or Yahoo depending on AOL during the 1990’s.  Netflix attempts to quell the weariness of investors by assuring them that Amazon will not strike against the company, noting that, “while the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in such a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service.”  However, Netflix cannot be fully sure of this, especially since Amazon’s streaming service is supplemented by their Prime service.  If Amazon was to offer a subscription service that competed with Netflix, to further enhance their competitive nature, Amazon could remove Netflix’s service, thereby ruining the media-streaming giant. 

Coincidentally, by gaining a dependence on Amazon in terms of software and hardware, Netflix is also dependent on Amazon in the investment market. If Amazon was to decrease tremendously in value, the stock’s decline would influence Netflix to decline in value as well.  Likewise, by being dependent on Netflix as a source of revenue, the decline of Netflix would mean the decline of Amazon’s market capitalization.   These proposition, mind the reader, are a long-term one and not a short-term one.  Despite the rapid short-term fluctuations of Amazon’s stock, stemming from a loss in earnings, Netflix is steadily rising in price. 

Historically, the connection between Netflix and Amazon is not new.  In the previous generation, when the dot-com bubble reached massive proportions, one would see a similar connection with AOL and other internet companies. During this time, AOL looked for additional streams of revenue in the form of advertising.  Meanwhile, burgeoning internet companies were looking for advertising that would increase their viewings, thereby increasing their share price in the form of irrational exuberance. By brokering a deal between Pets.com and AOL, for example, a dependence was set.  The survival of Pets.com depended on AOL using ad space for the pet-oriented company.  Meanwhile, AOL was dependent on the canine-friendly brand as a source of revenue, which at the time was the main factor in investment by speculators on the market.  If AOL decided to take away the ad space of Pets.com, for example, and replace the ad with an ad for Priceline.com, Pets.com would have lost an important stream of profit, thus killing the company.  Likewise, if AOL abandoned their arrangement with Pets.com, the founder of “You Got Mail” would lose revenue, thereby losing a part of their bottom line. 

TL;DR:  The company is too bloated with debt and overvaluation that the company should not be bought.  Sell now and reap your rewards. 

Critics of the proposition argue that unlike Pets.com, Netflix is “too big to fail.”  However, in the previous example, one must note that AOL, a much larger company during their heyday, collapsed under the circumstance of being too dependent on other companies as a source of success. AOL depended on smaller internet companies with their gullibility as a source of revenue.  When AOL lost these companies due to the early stages of the dot-com bubble bursting, AOL lost revenue, creating a snowball effect that eventually led to the demise of the company in its’ original form. 

In short, Netflix is a fundamentally unsound company.  Like many technological companies that have come before Netflix, the media streaming organization is stuck in a rut.  Speculators purchase the stock due to perceived unlimited upside potential in the future.  In the short-term, the company is valued higher than CBS because of the rapid growth in the company.  However, because Netflix is starting to lose money despite gaining money, Netflix as a large brand will eventually shrink in size, both in price and value, when the next correction occurs.  This is important, since the goal of our research team is to make sure that we do not purchase at an overvalued price.

 I'd like to close by saying a word about what distinguishes our
company from our competitors. You get more for your money with Wolfpack
because we originate the well in house, there are no middlemen's
markup. A 1% interest in our JV is equal to a 1% working interest in
the well. Many of our competitors are selling another companys' project
which is often heavily retailed. Also, Wolfpack keeps units for itself
so it can be said we have skin in the game. We believe in our projects
and prove so by being heavily invested in them.

  If these are the types of investments that interest you, give me a call
and let's talk about how you can benefit. Or if you want to talk about
our current or future projects, call me and we will discuss. Take care
and let me hear from you.

The El Lobo well is set to commence drilling this week. There are but a
handful of units left. The units are $16,000, the ROI is estimated to
be 3.7-1 at the low end of production estimates and as high as 8-1 at
the high end. The Packman is the next well scheduled for drilling. We
are just now starting to market it but due to the reserve estimates to
be double the El Lobo and the price of oil on the rise we expect the
Packman to sell quickly. The units are $16,000, the ROI is expected to
be 4-1 on the low end of production estimates and as high as 16.8-1 on
the high end. As far as other fees or expenses are concerned, these
offerings are turnkey so unless there are some abnormalities associated
with the drilling of the well, $16,000 is your investment.""

What do you guys think? 

I read with a working interested you are billed every month with the costs of the well and I honestly do not know how i would even calculate my return. The numbers he said sounded good though. 

Disclaimer: I already have my roth ira maxed, 6 month emergency fund, and over 40k in my taxed account. Just looking at other things

EDIT: It is turnkey so you would not be billed monthly or anything, it is included in the initial investment (16k). I was also reading if it is a dryhole they return 15-25% and you can supposedly write off ALOT of your taxes dryhole or not.",1

15-04-28,"Overweight NYMT, time to rebalance?","Three years ago I bought a large chunk of NYMT in my 401k, at the time it was in the high 6's. I have re-invested the dividends since then, and purchased more using a small percentage of my monthly contributions.


I now find myself with a very large percentage of my 401k (greater than 30%) in NYMT. As I am still young, the remainder is (almost) fully invested, using broad, low expense ratio ETFs, like VYM. etc.


Obviously, NYMT has done very well for me. My investment philosophy has always been ""sometimes wrong, but never in doubt"", but now I find myself with some questions....


1. NYMT, as I understand it, isn't a straight up mortgage REIT, it is more of a hybrid. Should I be nervous about a potential rate hike?

2. I wouldn't normally let any single investment occupy such a large percentage of my holdings, but this thing has been great, continues to be great, and I hate to mess with it. Should I rebalance, or just let it ride?

3. I am not a stock picker, I don't have the knowledge, patience, or confidence. I use ETFs, and sleep well at night. So why am I invested in a single REIT? I have no idea, I just kind of did it. Would I be better off finding a fund of REITs?",1

15-04-29,"If you're just trading AAPL and are confused/upset by its market movement after a good earnings report...you should really just be trading indexes.","AAPL has been kind of 'easy mode' for trading.  It earned a spot on the DJIA for a reason, it's part of why S&amp;P500 index funds have dominated many other sectors through the last six years.  It's one of the stocks that is easiest to see the long-term productivity effects through the short-term emotions.   But that also means that success in trading on productivity of the company makes it easy to confuse for having a 'real' grasp on the emotions that drive the short term behavior.  This is a mistake.

I was originally given submitter status here for probably the wrong reasons--I had just told most of /r/personalfinance to just index everything, because honestly not many people have the knowledge to do more.  *I* personally don't, and any stock trades I do, I see more as mental exercise/pursuit of my investment hobby, and nothing more.  I think it is fantastic what some of you do here and I read your posts to sharpen my mind and gain insight so that I can become better at my hobby.  But I am probably never going to reach a level where I feel comfortable trading more than 5% of my portfolio actively even if I have the free trades from my brokerage to do that at will.  

And as a result, I am never going to experience the emotional stress I am seeing some of you guys going through when things don't go the way you expected, even when you were right.  Because that's how the market is.  It's not there to make *you* rich or to build up your ego.  The long term index uptrends are there and will continue to be a boon to anyone with a retirement mindset.  That's where I have made nearly all of my money.  I'm a physicist and tend to look at market forces as being not so different from fundamental forces.  The long term growth of productivity and stagnation of worker wages is kind of like the gravitational force.  It's relatively predictable based on clear and quantifiable factors.  It has a clear direction, although that direction is not always up.   Emotions and valuations and technicals and even market fundamentals are nothing more than quantum electrodynamics by comparison--more significant in the NOW, but totally irrelevant when you're actually needing this money in your old age, and ultimately the momentum generated by it largely balances out over time.  And pretty wholly divergent from the ever higher march of productivity.  Predictable to some extent, but there's always going to be uncertainty.  That's just how small-scale effects are.  

And if you can't handle being wrong about things that no one can always be right about, short-term trading is not for you.",19

15-04-28,"Retail brokerages are being left out of the SEC's stock market reform club","http://www.businessinsider.com/r-secs-stock-market-reform-club-locks-out-retail-brokers-2015-4

""One recent example of a proposed SEC rule that retail brokers say will harm investors is the so-called ""tick-size pilot"" which would apply to shares of a large set of smaller companies. Once in effect, brokers will have to sell each share of these companies at prices at least a nickel higher than where they buy them, instead of the penny difference currently required.

That wider gap gives brokers higher profits, which in theory will make it more worth their while to take the other sides of trades for investors, making it easier to complete transactions in these thinly traded stocks.

But those benefits might mean more to big investors, who might look to sell large numbers of shares at once, than to small investors. Individual investors typically make smaller trades, and being forced to buy at prices that are a nickel-a-share higher than where they can sell could amount to their paying a sort of tax to the broker.

Schwab said in a letter to the SEC that the program would ultimately result in a ""wealth transfer"" from retail investors to stock exchanges and middlemen. Fidelity also said in a letter to the regulator that it does not support the plan.

The potential cost of the program to all investors could be up to $455 million dollars annually, TD Ameritrade said in a letter to the SEC in December. The No. 1 retail broker by client trading volume estimated the potential cost to its customers between $11 million and $18.4 million.""

15-04-28,"Portfolio analysis - small cap deficiencies, money to spare for corrections.","I recently came into an inheritance that I would like to put to work in a portfolio that my grandfather helped me start that I have coupled with a 401k through my work. The details are as follows -

* VEIRX	1481.99
* ODMAX	104.14
* MAIIX	513.19
* BSPIX	36.21
* NMSAX	124.34
* PESPX	31.64
* JVMIX	477.89
* OIDAX	200.65
* PCRAX	469.86
* VBTLX	129.17
* CRARX	77.49

VEIRX is my Roth IRA my grandfather started. I regularly contribute the 5500 allowed per year to it. The rest comprise my company's 401k allocations, which I have been contributing 10% to until now - due to my inheritance - I will be contributing the full 18k to from here on out. 

After some analysis, I've realized with this portfolio I've got zero coverage in the style-map area of 'small value' and 'small growth'. My 401k has about 2% of my total portfolio in small blend.

I have been considering the following to add coverage (I am partial to Vanguard) - 
* VEXPX - small growth
* VMGIX  - mid growth
* VISVX  - small value

I would attempt to balance my portfolio with these funds - the small-value and small-growth I would buy enough to get 3% in each, and the mid growth to get to 7%.

A few details - 

I'm 37 in a few months. I am single, with no intent of having children. I have recently paid off my mortgage, and I do not have a house payment currently; BUT I do have my sights set on buying a house and renting my current home. I have a good, stable job that is quite secure that pays ~93k a year. With the advent of my inheritance, I have approximately 750k in cash that I would like to invest in an intellegent manner. Moreover, I would like to invest not only to fund my retirement without having to concede to a ""target retirement fund"", but I would like to invest in some ""high risk, high reward"" style funds that could fund some nice vacations.

I am currently dealing with some downtime at work, so I am trying to educate myself as much as possible with the articles and webpages in the side bar. I do not object to speaking with a financial advisor, but with the information availble here, I feel I could make some wise decisions.

http://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/document-805915460.pdf

I agree with the broader premise but I have a few doubts. I hope someone can answer them.

1. On page 3 he gives a formula for Future value creation. I agree with the numerator but do not understand how the denominator was derived at. Why does it have to be Cost of Capital (CoC) plus CoC2?

2. On page 10 exhibit 5, why does the multiple for 4% ROIIC go from 7.1 (for 4% earnings growth) to 3.3 (for 6% earnings growth)? I am not asking specifically about the numbers, but why does it **decrease** at all. Is it because when the ROIIC is less than CoC, earnings growth will negatively compound value creation, which would lead to a downward spiral (even though earnings are growing) and thus reduce the multiple and attractiveness of the security?

15-04-28,Crowded Index Investing - possible?,"It is ""common knowledge"" that stocks outperform for the long run, which has been true over last many decades in the US (although this does not hold in other countries - but that is another topic). My question is, with the mass adoption of ETFs/passive mutual funds, is it possible that people are too concentrated in the passive index portfolio. While you get diversification of idiosyncratic risk, your systematic risk exposure to everyone else's portfolio is high. Can you defend the argument that capital is currently being ""stupidly"" allocated across the economy based on historical market cap/price data as defined by an index? If so, is there a state of the world in which you would say index investing is overcrowded and you should shift your focus to being underweight/overweight certain sectors or individual companies?

The counter argument is that of course you want to invest at current market weightings, because those market prices reflect all future earnings. I find this argument can hold on short horizons, stock prices are mostly efficient. However, so much of the earnings machine and shareholder responsibility is focused on the next two to four quarters, so I do not think this holds as well on longer time frames. A great example is stock buybacks, it doesn't matter if a stock is cheap or expensive, a new buyer in the market drives up market value/prices and locks in a higher allocation to your company from the index money simply because of an accounting mark. Wall street loves it for a couple of quarters and then forgets about the long term consequences.

Mostly a ramble, but hopefully some interesting perspectives on this...",0
15-04-28,"What, if anything could stop the marijuana industry from being a no brainier investment in the coming 2 years?","The popular opinion is to allow the states to choose for themselves regarding marijuana legalization. With the valuable examples like Colorado and Washington are setting, the other states are trying to figure out how it could work in their respective states. 
If this is the trend, what if anything could make the players in the marijuana industry a bad bet in the coming years? I am interested to see what reddit thinks, but I believe there is nothing, even a toddler having a bad brownie trip, that could stop the future money. Every time a state opens up, the industry advances. Obviously, some states would help advance the industry more than others. California, New York, Texas, Florida. Another point would be that there is money involved in both the medical and recreational stages. ",0

15-04-28,Understanding BABA (insight from an American living in China...),"What is Alibaba? 
(only covering important platforms/services)

**Chinese E-Commerce**

Alibaba already dominates e-commerce in China (JD and Alibaba together have ~80% of online ecommerce). It's growth rate is directly correlated with the growth of Chinese consumerism. 

Online commerce represents the main portion of the consumer economy. Brick and mortars lag far behind in total commerce. In the city I live in, Guangzhou (the third largest), you can visit any mall and see just a small percent of people actually go there to buy things. They go there to look at things and then go home and buy it on Taobao/Tmall/JD. Very different from US economy. I reckon a large % of brick and mortar commerce is wholesale buying. 

*Taobao* - Enterpreneurs / Small Retailers / Factory B2C

*Tmall* - Online Flagship Stores (Apple, Nike, etc..)

**Global E-Commerce**

*Alibaba* - B2B           
      
*AliExpress* - B2C     

**Cloud Computing**      
      
*AliYun* - more than 1.4 million customers and beginning international expansion. It's bigger than Amazon's AWS. 
        
**Financial Unit**       
     
&gt; Alibaba is entitled to a payment of at least $9.4 billion if Alipay or its parent hold an IPO. Alibaba also gets the perpetual right to 37.5 percent of the finance arm’s pretax earnings and can buy a stake of about one-third if regulators approve.      

[This quote is from this article, which explains the structure in more detail.] (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/alibaba-finance-arm-said-to-plan-2016-initial-public-offering-i5je2vu0) This financial unit includes AliPay- A payment processor with 300 million users doing 80 million transactions DAILY. AliPay is already integrated with the financial unit's other services... Users can keep their money in the AliPay system and get interest payments DAILY (currently at 4%/yr)- so it's acting like a savings account and giving the financial unit some money to invest, loan, etc... There's a chance that their financial unit can take a big share from the major banks in China (especially regarding loans to small and medium sized businesses).       
      
**Notable Equity Stakes:** 

* 18.5% in Youku - it's China's Youtube (now transitioning to produce original content- huge upside here)
* Lyft
* Meizu - an up-and-coming smartphone maker in China
* Snapchat 
* Sina - news portal and parent co. of Weibo (twitter/fb of China)
* Haier - home electronics      
       
**Leadership**

Jack Ma is a visionary. If you have any doubt about this, I suggest you view all his speeches on Youtube to learn a bit more about the guy at the top. Trust that he will find the right opportunities to grow his e-commerce site (like expanding into India).      
     
**NOTE:**

I'm probably missing some things... This is just a basic overview. I'm not a financial expert- just a marketing guy for a sex toy company =)

I just figured I would write this out because you a lot of people on this sub are misunderstanding this company. It does not have the ""potential to be like Amazon""- it already dominates Chinese e-commerce and has the potential to be an global e-commerce giant. It's also branching out and investing its cash. 

**Trading Advice:** 
      
If you're looking for a short term opportunity, then I have no advice for you. 

If you're looking for a long term opportunity (5+ years), then this is one of the best options for you (if you want to expose yourself to the Chinese economy). Compare it to any other option you have on the US market and check for yourself. Is it worth 200 billion right now? Not sure- but their growth rate is impressive (and I trust it will continue to grow) and their margins are fantastic. They will have a lot of money to play with and I trust the leadership to make money for its shareholders. ",29

So are there any funds that cater to this need, or are they all aimed at people with lump sums to invest and forget about? Are there any pitfalls to this approach? Are there any alternative investments that are better suited?

15-04-29,"Question: why is it that I can see a 52 week high/low of 10 to 5$ but on the chart it can peak at 40$. Why doesn't the chart adjust to show the actual relative value?","I bought stock in ATLS, thinking it was a good buy after looking at the chart and seeing it drop from its highest around 40$ to 7$. However the 52 week high/low shows that the stock ranged from 5-10 dollars. I would not have purchased this stock if I had looked at the 52 week range first and seen this. It was mostly an impulse buy after seeing the range on the graph. In the future I will be more careful.

I want to know if there is some kind of mistake or if the stock has condensed somehow so that the high of 40$ is equivalent to the current 52 week high of 10$. Has the stock done an opposite of a split? I guess I want to know if the stock has indeed been at 40$ in the recent past, or is the 52 week range correct in that the stock was 10$ which is equivalent to the 40$ because of some kind of split or what-not.

15-04-29,401(k): roth vs traditional+invest tax savings,"Hello, I haven't been able to find a great analysis of these two options. Most of the articles I've read compare investing the same amount via both Roth and traditional deductions. However, you have more money to invest by making traditional deductions due to the tax savings. I'm interested in an analysis of investing X amount via Roth deductions vs X amount PLUS the tax savings via traditional deductions. For example, $500/mo via Roth and $500/mo plus the $150/mo tax savings via traditional. In other words, a comparison of investing the appropriate amount via both methods so my net pay is the same. 

If I couldn't invest that extra money from traditional deductions, Roth seems to be the better option. However, I'm in my mid-twenties, so that extra money would have a lot of time to grow for a time when my tax bracket should (hopefully) be lower. I'd appreciate any articles on this you may be aware of. Thanks in advance!",0

They've announced the acquisition of the French software maker, new product lineup around the corner, expansion out of the US making a better % of their revenue... but, lots of competition ahead (how real is it?), nothing too major on the capitalization of their media segment yet.

Maybe this should go in the daily advice thread. Where's that anyway?

I've found a company on the OTCBB, and yes I know you're thinking, ewww, but I know the CEO and I've looked at all the patents. The first iteration of the product was shit. The current version they have is great. The engineering behind it is great. I'm an engineer. So I know the product will do well, however I'm confused about investing.

They only have one product. What is the typical life of a company like this, the exit strategy? Sure they could try to sell more and slowly build. If they decide to license the tech and stop producing in-house, will the stock be worth anything as license fees increase? If they just sell the IP outright, is the company even worth keeping?",0

15-04-29,"Anyone get in on EVA (Enviva Partners, LP) IPO?","I took the plunge into MLP's today with [Enviva's](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=EVA) IPO.

I was thoroughly surprised that it opened at the actual IPO price ($20), I was under the impression that only insiders and major players get access at the initial price. 

Nice 7.5% gain today along with an 8% yield. Crossing my fingers come next April that K-1's are manageable though. 


The only drawback I see right now that is that General Partner is already at max level IDR (50%), which means the entity that owns EVA gets 50% of their distributions (and that entity is not publicly traded). Normally with a young MLP the GP has not yet achieved the 50% IDR milestone and thus has a strong incentive to grow the distribution in order to increase their take of said distribution. Long story short I don't expect them to have phenomenal growth but I do think the price will rise to $30-$35 to bring the yield down to the MLP average, around 5%.

15-04-29,Growth Investing - What company today will be 10x the size in the future?,"**Goal:** Let's identify the strongest opportunity for investment today, something that in the future we'll look back on and say THANK GOODNESS or WHY :( didn't I put my money into that (regrets: nflx, aapl, cmg, sbux, etc)
    
    
**Requirements:**    
-Publicly traded company    
-Common stock investment (not option, ETF, etc)    
-Market capitalization of at least $100MM    
-Timeframe 5 years    
-You would invest in this company, after all this company is going to be 10x in the future    
-Bullet point your reasons    
-Bonus points for safety: strong balance sheet (assets &gt; liabilities), little to no debt, profitable today    
-Bonus bonus point for identifying the biggest risk to company, but mitigate it.
    
    
**My Pick:**    
**OLED - Universal Display Corporation**    
-Leader in OLED (organic light emitting diodes) technologies with over 3,500 global patents    
-Big name display and lighting manufacturers have supply and license/royalty agreements with UDC including Samsung, LG, BOE, Innolux, Philips, Oledworks, etc.    
-Growing list of consumer applications that OLED technology is designed into including Samsung phones/tablets, Apple watch, LG OLED TVs, virtual reality displays, lighting, vehicle lighting, etc.    
-Still very much beginning of product cycle for OLED technology.    
-Investment in manufacturing capacity is continuing and is coming online in Korea, Japan, China, and US.    
-Increased production capacity will continue to bring down costs of OLED devices.    
-OLED displays have power, contrast, color range/accuracy, and slimness benefits over LCD technology.  (note still some pros and cons, but largely positive)    
-Strong and growing margins    
-Revenue and EPS growth, profitable today with J-curve potential    
-Strong balance sheet and no debt    

**Biggest Risk:** Technology obsolescence.  Mitigated by the fact that the product cycle and trends are point up and to the right, plus current investments into manufacturing facilities cost billions of dollars.  Big boys don't push that type of cash into weak technologies, and they definitely have a significant expectation for a return on their investment.   Second key risk: Patent cliffs, mitigated by recent 1/26/15 LG long term Material Supply and License/Royalty Agreement that goes through 2022.
Cheers all.  I hope to hear counter arguments to my idea, as well as your other great investment ideas!    
**_Note on Position_**: I am long OLED with 50% of my portfolio invested in this company.  I highly suggest you do your own research and due diligence before investing.

15-04-29,Ok so about that Phyzer pitch....,"I figured since I didnt have any hard details and a solid case on why you should buy phyzer except for one reason: I think I might have have been exposed to some good logical information, i went ahead and made a post lsat week about how Ill be making a full writeup of why you should own phyzer.

Well now that I am about to write the post, I realized that I dont have any information to add without doing research, and ATM of writing this sentence, I dont even know where it is trading (close but still a guess).  


ANyway, for me to try to find a reason to buy it would be the same thing as trying to find a reason after I made a random guess, or I can sound smart and actually find a good arguement to own it-which would ineveitbly lead to my initial reaction to own it.  It would be a win win for me to seem smart and know what Im talking about as if i did have a few solid reasons for buying the thing, and IM sure there are, but frankly i realized I dont care about that.

Therefore, there is no basis for owning phyzer other than reasons you can find for yourself, much like a toddler looks for excuses to justify his actions after hes been caught.

ANd now the gravy:

Heres what I know-It takes a full 9-10 months of official testing of fda rounds before any announcements can be made about initiating production about any drugs.

RIght now, its about month #6-7 on a drug which has moved testing onto humans since its simple in concept, but safe enough to progress to this stage.  It would be appeal to a wide audience (not a cure for the common cold wide, but think chronic headache demographic-there are still a lot of people in this particular market)

On the next window of announcements for this new development (or any news for that matter), I think this stock can run-but heres the butt end of it--

Its phyzer-how much can it really move, even if it does have the cure for cancer and announces it starting production?  A few points maybe, but in this sector, we can see slow but higher long term growth, so i think it will go higher even after the announcement of ""We found something new-and it works!"" wears off.

Second, sorry, no charts.  In my mind when I first had the grand idea to sit down and write a novel with charts and underlines and italics and bullets everything seemed to take me to the land of legacy traders, but sorry, i did none of that and its 3 am and I may or maybe not, but possibly slightly, under some influence.  Perhaps I bought a new car, so im excited, or its the drugs and alcohol.  Or its the cold down here, but iM TOO lazy to turn up the heat. the thermostat is all the way over there.

3.  Yeah i think ill buy more phyzer, but my mouse is far away, and im not touching it now bc Im already typiung this and If I checked which options I bought initially would require me to find the mouse, move it and click and type other info fuck that, bottom line is buy phszer, its as good a bet as any on wsb, and has the same chance of making money or loosing money as anything else discussed here, but At least this time I heard it from an honest long term worker that is familiar with doing experiements and testing and wearing lab coats with some certifications.  

Id buy options 5-6 months out and wait for something to get announced in 3-5 months and sell no matter what.  But imagine it does send the stock mad high and you look back on your shitty portfolio and say holy fuck man, these options went thru the roof!! that would be fucking great.

15-04-30,Yahoo Finance: Bad sign? Retail investors all in: TD Ameritrade,"**This text is originally posted @ Yahoo Finance. Useful information for retail investors.**

A broad look at the 6.5 million customer accounts at TD Ameritrade (NYSE: AMTD) indicates that retail investors are ""pretty fully invested"" in stocks, the online brokerage's CEO said Thursday.

Fred Tomczyk cited several signs of this: margin loans at high levels, client cash at low levels and account holders at the firm logging in frequently. ""It's usually a good indication that people are very engaged in the markets and watching their investments closely,"" he said on CNBC's "" Squawk Box .""

But Tomczyk acknowledged the potential pitfalls of these trends and what they may portend for stocks. ""I wouldn't be surprised if we have a correction here. We've had six [or] 6½ years of up markets here.""

The Dow Jones industrial average (Dow Jones Global Indexes: .DJI) and the S&amp;P 500 (INDEX: .SPX) were relatively flat on the year as of Wednesday's closing. ""I think last year it wasn't an overly strong market. This year it hasn't been an overly strong market,"" Tomczyk said. ""I think it's all going to depend on what the data tells us about the U.S. economy in the next three to six months.""

Many economists are expecting a pickup in growth in the second half of the year, after the government on Wednesday reported that first-quarter gross domestic product grew at a lower-than-expected 0.2 percent. The economy advanced 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter and 5 percent in the third quarter of 2014.

In a policy statement Wednesday, the Fed played down the soft economic growth and removed all calendar references to when an interest rate hike may be coming.

Liftoff in June seems to be pretty much out, with September seen as the most likely month for the first rate increase in nearly a decade. But Tomczyk believes the Fed won't move until later. ""What the forward [yield] curve would tell you right now [is] short term rates aren't going to move until December.""

Earlier on ""Squawk Box,"" UBS economist Drew Matus argued for a June move. ""They had June lined up in their sights as of March.""

""I think everything would be functioning a lot better now,"" if the Fed didn't back off, he said.


Looking at individual stock names, Tomczyk said, ""Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is our most widely held stock. [It] has been for a long time.""

He also said clients are heavily invested Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), which has fallen about 5 percent in 2015 along with the 40 percent decline in oil prices over the past 12 months, though U.S. crude has been recovering somewhat.

""We have [a] large active trader base and so they tend to have a contrarian view,"" said Tomczyk, whose company is celebrating its 40th anniversary this year.

Last week, TD Ameritrade (NYSE: AMTD) reported earnings of 35 cents per share for its fiscal second quarter, which were were in line with expectations. Revenue of $803 million was below forecasts for $821 million.

Earlier this month, rival Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW) missed on the top and bottom lines, with earnings of 22 cents per share on revenue of $1.53 billion in the first quarter.

Now my concern is when I look at the WIN historical data it essentially has what the actual price per share was multiplied by 5. Is this normal practice?

15-04-30,"Apple, Healthcare, and Why I Will Never Bet Against Them","First off I'd like to say Apple expanding into healthcare is not a new theory at all. It is pretty widely known that Tim Cook has talked about expanding into healthcare and there have been numerous articles on Apple's interest in healthcare. I just don't think people are realizing the implications that means for **future Apple products.** 

One of the biggest components of the Apple Watch is the health aspect. Gathering data on your body, etc. Tim Cook in an interview with Charlie Rose(fascinating interview btw) stated, ""Arguably with healthcare, there is a wide open field to make some really profound contributions"" then goes onto explain sort of experimental health components to Apple products, as well as talking about how the Apple watch gathers data on you fitness wise. 

What a likely association to make with the future of Apple, is into healthcare. I think this will personally result in the greatest Apple product we know to date. This product will be a personalized healthcare device that can analyze your body with very thorough detail and generally measure the overall health of your body with basic things like blood sugar, heartbeat, BMI, etc. This could possibly include more complicated procedures such as detecting tumors, analyzing bone density and maybe even predicting a stroke/heart attack a certain time amount before it happens. If you're having an immediate health risk like a stroke or heart attack, the device will know and calls 911 automatically. Diabetes, asthma, cancer, white blood cell and red blood cell count, strokes, heart attacks, common colds, the flu (and many, many more bodily functions and diseases/sicknesses) ALL being analyzed in your body and reporting back to you on a personalized device. Possibly even synced with your local hospitals system. I think this technology will either be a new device or implemented into the watch or iPhone. If it is implemented into an existing product it will most likely be the watch due to it being direct contact with your skin. 

**Imagine the impact that would have on our society**. I think this will become a reality after Apple finishes with developing the TV. I'd really like to know what you guys think of this.

TLDR; We're going to the moon baby, see you guys in 10 years.

15-04-30,"The Case for $CPRX, Catalyst Pharmaceutical","Disclosure: I am long $CPRX.



Ignoring all other projects, [CPRX has a drug, Firdapse, that has demonstrated positive Phase 3 data](http://ir.catalystpharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=873552). This drug is intended to treat a condition known at LEMS, which [afflicts roughly 4500 people in all of North America](http://www.catalystpharma.com/firdapse-QA.shtml). Data is strong enough that FDA approval is expected. With approval, they earn rights for exclusive distribution of the drug for 7 years with [peak projected annual revenues that could be about $100 million annually](http://www.catalystpharma.com/firdapse-QA.shtml). Current market capitalization is $270 million. 

No brainer right? Why am I even writing this? Well, to share an opportunity with you. [The share price has recently taken a large hit on news of a competitor, Jacobus Pharmaceutical, also having positive data regarding this drug](http://www.thestreet.com/story/13125612/1/catalyst-pharma-competitor-surprises-with-positive-orphan-disease-drug-study-results.html). While having a competitor increases risk, I see this as additional validation that the drug actually works.

Jacobus has been distributing the drug under the compassionate use program approved by the FDA for free to LEMS patients for many years now. There is a moral argument that has weight in this very niche space. It goes something like this: CPRX is greedy for trying to charge money for something patients are getting for free already. Before you formulate your opinion, understand that this has significantly affected share price in the past and represents a source of volatility and/or risk depending on your timeline.

The drug in question is 3,4-diaminopyridine which Jacobus currently makes and provides. CPRX is seeking approval for Firdapse, an analog of the drug that Jacobus is making. It is 3,4-diaminopyridine phosphate. This data is used to support the ""greedy"" moral argument state above. However, there is actually a very functional difference between the two analogs. [The drug in the form that Jacobus produces requires refrigeration - Pg. VI](http://www.touchneurology.com/system/files/private/articles/10905/pdf/ohsieb.pdf). The phosphate analog produced by CPRX is stable at room temperature and *does not* require refrigeration. This is a legitimate competitive advantage on the supplier and user end (eg. storage and transportation costs).

CPRX is ahead of Jacobus. [The current status of Jacobus is somewhat ambiguous but some internet sources suggest Phase 2](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01511978?term=3%2C4-diaminopyridine&amp;rank=5). CPRX is well into Phase 3.

Currently and future-looking, [the Jacobus compassionate use program can only reach between 100 and 200 people](http://www.lavoiegroup.com/news-and-events/bid/349029/Catalyst-Pharma-Fights-Greed-Charges-Over-Orphan-Drug). Their moral argument begins to be challenged here as they are only helping a small portion of people afflicted. Proper FDA approval can provide access to many more patients. With ACA, affordability concerns should be somewhat reduced.

Jacobus's capability in production has been also called into question with [numerous FDA violations](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM402956.pdf).

Will Jacobus keep giving the drug away for free after spending millions putting it through phase trials? I doubt it. Given that their analog requires refrigeration, I would expect their price to be even higher due to energy-dependent storage and increased rate of spoilage.

From just potential revenues, if we assign a modest 5:1 ratio of market capitalization to annual revenue, this drug alone will deliver $500 million in market cap. Catalyst has several other drugs in their pipeline, but I won't speculate any further on those fronts as they are less proven and just like any other small-cap biotech.

I believe that the recent decrease in share pricing caused by ""new"" data released by Jacobus has created a opportunity to purchase CPRX shares at discount.

* FDA decision is expected Mid-2016.

So this Robbins-Geller company is trying to conduct a class action lawsuit against Aerie Pharmaceuticals for ""hyping"" up their stock and after a bad trial the stock fell 64%, according to the article. I'm no expert, but isn't that a bunch of bologna? Just because the company may have TOLD people their product will succeed doesn't mean they should've listened. I don't understand how they can be sued for NOT succeeding. I imagine this won't stop them from continuing research, but I imagine this lawsuit is just bad bad news for their stock value, and I bought in at 11. 

Also on a side note, they're releasing their financial report May 7. Anyone know if Pharmaceutical companies usually see stock value increase after these?

Every single option, whether call options or put options, has a time factor. An option will expire on a certain date that’s determined by mutual agreement between the option seller and the option buyer. This time factor also affects the option’s premium.

The premium of an option is based on a simple mathematical formula: the square root of time (how long before the option expires). Thus, as time goes on, the premium you pay (as an option buyer) increases at an ever slowing rate. This right here is the assumption behind options, which is something that you (the option buyer) can exploit.

Keep in mind that the premium is meant to protect the option seller (and hurt you, the option buyer). This basic assumption implies that:

Over the long term, the market is neutral. Gains will be offset by losses, and losses will be offset by gains. Thus, it is ok for premiums to increase at a slowing rate (the slope decreases) b/c the risk also increases at an ever slowing rate.

Thankfully, this assumption is just plain wrong. Or else trends wouldn’t exist! And since we know that (obviously) trends do exist, we can exploit this assumption to our own benefit. For example, commodities have been in a bullish trend over the past 13 years. Whoever sold commodity call options would have lost a lot of money over the last 13 years!

Thus, it is evident that long term options (1 year – 5 year) options relatively speaking become cheaper and cheaper (because time is square rooted). That’s why long term options are generally much cheaper than short term options and why, generally speaking, long term options are much better investments.

Volatility
The definition of volatility is simple: how much has the price of a market been fluctuating recently? The larger the fluctuations, the higher the volatility. The smaller the fluctuations, the lower the volatility.

The second component that affects an option’s premium (besides the time until expiration) is volatility. This is actually quite simple to understand – the more volatile prices are recently, the higher premium you (as the option buyer) will be required to pay. The smaller volatility has recently been, the lower the premium you will pay. Why?

Because from a pure theoretical risk management standpoint, volatility = risk. The theorists assume that present low volatility will result to future low volatility. In other words, they extrapolate the present low volatility into the future. We’ll see why that is not true in reality.

Theoretically speaking, low volatility equals to low risk to the option seller. Thus, options are cheap to buy when volatility is low. However, volatility is usually lowest (option premiums are cheapest) near the end of a bull market, when every person out there is a blindly bullish (a.k.a. the market is in a bubble). Thus, in reality low volatility actually equals high risk. When volatility is low, you know that the market is in a bubble and sooner or later, the bubble is going to burst and all the bulls are going to be in a ton of pain.

Thus, the time when volatility is low and options are cheap is exactly when risk is the greatest. Low volatility does not equate to small risk. It equates to large risk (because the bubble is about to burst).

The most common measurement of volatility if VIX, an index created in 1985. Its sole purpose is to measure the amount of “fear” or “volatility” in the market.",1

15-04-30,long $CPRX,"Disclosure: I am long $CPRX.

Ignoring all other projects, [CPRX has licensed a drug from BioMarin](http://ir.catalystpharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=717459), Firdapse, that has demonstrated [positive Phase 3 data](http://ir.catalystpharma.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=873552). This drug is intended to treat a condition known at LEMS, which [afflicts roughly 4500 people in all of North America](http://www.catalystpharma.com/firdapse-QA.shtml). Data is strong enough that FDA approval is expected. With approval, they earn rights for exclusive distribution of the drug for 7 years with [peak projected annual revenues that could be about $100 million annually](http://www.catalystpharma.com/firdapse-QA.shtml). Current market capitalization is $270 million. 

No brainer right? Why am I even writing this? Well, to share an opportunity with you. [The share price has recently taken a large hit on news of a competitor, Jacobus Pharmaceutical, also having positive data regarding this drug](http://www.thestreet.com/story/13125612/1/catalyst-pharma-competitor-surprises-with-positive-orphan-disease-drug-study-results.html). While having a competitor increases risk, I see this as additional validation that the drug actually works.

Jacobus has been distributing the drug under the compassionate use program approved by the FDA for free to LEMS patients for many years now. There is a moral argument that has weight in this very niche space. It goes something like this: CPRX is greedy for trying to charge money for something patients are getting for free already. Before you formulate your opinion, understand that this has significantly affected share price in the past and represents a source of volatility and/or risk depending on your timeline.

The drug in question is 3,4-diaminopyridine which Jacobus currently makes and provides. CPRX is seeking approval for Firdapse, an analog of the drug that Jacobus is making. It is 3,4-diaminopyridine **phosphate**. This notion of ""analog"" is used to support the ""greedy"" moral argument state above - that they are the ""same"" drug, profiting from a drug given away for free, etc. *However, there is actually a very functional difference between the two analogs*. [The drug in the form that Jacobus produces requires refrigeration - Pg. VI](http://www.touchneurology.com/system/files/private/articles/10905/pdf/ohsieb.pdf). The phosphate analog produced by CPRX is stable at room temperature and *does not* require refrigeration. This is a legitimate competitive advantage and is a benefit from the supplier and user end (eg. storage and transportation costs).

CPRX is ahead of Jacobus. [The current status of Jacobus is somewhat ambiguous but some internet sources suggest Phase 2](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01511978?term=3%2C4-diaminopyridine&amp;rank=5). CPRX is well into Phase 3.

Currently and future-looking, [the Jacobus compassionate use program can only reach between 100 and 200 people.](http://www.lavoiegroup.com/news-and-events/bid/349029/Catalyst-Pharma-Fights-Greed-Charges-Over-Orphan-Drug) Their moral argument begins to be challenged here as they are only helping a small portion of people afflicted. Proper FDA approval can provide access to many more patients. With ACA, affordability concerns should be somewhat reduced.

Jacobus's capability in production has been also called into question with [numerous FDA violations](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM402956.pdf).

Will Jacobus keep giving the drug away for free after spending millions putting it through phase trials? I doubt it. Given that their analog requires refrigeration, I would actually expect their price to be even higher due to energy-dependent storage and increased rate of spoilage.

From just potential revenues, if we assign a modest 5:1 ratio of market capitalization to potential Firdapse-generated annual revenue, this drug alone will deliver $500 million in market cap. Catalyst has several other drugs in their pipeline, but I won't speculate any further on those fronts as they are less proven and just like any other small-cap biotech.

I believe that the recent decrease in share pricing caused by ""new"" data released by Jacobus has created an opportunity to purchase CPRX shares at discount.

Operator

Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Littlewood from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.

Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse
Thank you very much. I appreciate the opportunity, guys, and the clarification on APIO just now was certainly useful. I had a couple of questions on USIO pricing. It was my understanding that Essar Algoma had a pre-fixed price last year. If I remember it was $114 or $117 a ton or ton or something, but they carried over some tons into the beginning of this year.

If you were selling tons to Essar Algoma today that would be somewhere in the $50 at ton range, so there is a pretty big difference in the price you realize between the two. Just wondering if you might be able to help us with what the magnitude of that was in the March quarter numbers?

Lourenco Goncalves - Chairman of the Board, President, CEO, Principal Executive Officer
Nathan, I do not discuss pricing client-by-client. The fact that you know our price or you believe you know our price is a matter of a serious concern for me, because this would be a violation of the confidentiality clause of the contract between Cliffs Natural Resources and Essar Algoma, and you just mentioned that you know the price, **so you will eventually will be subpoenad in the lawsuit that I am moving against Essar Algoma based on breach of confidentiality**, so I am not going to discuss this subject. What will be your next question.

Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse
No problem, fair enough, Lourenco. The other one was just on the embedded guidance. I believe that at least your public disclosure in the past has been fairly clear that the HRC price is the driver of the in line steel contracts that you have with Mittal. Could you clarify what HRC price is embedded in the current USIO pricing guidance?

Lourenco Goncalves - Chairman of the Board, President, CEO, Principal Executive Officer
Well, the way we talk about hot-rolled prices, the price was not linked into the any index. They are based on the actual prices that the clients execute with their clients, so our relationship with this client, and I am not nominating any specific ones, is so open that we have access to their actual hot-rolled prices, realized prices and they are checked and included in the price going forward. That is the way it works, so of course the indexes are illusively guidance for that, but the actual price is that they practice are much higher than the spot or the index or anything that you may use as a general number for HRC prices.

Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse
Yes. Absolutely, and I was aware of that Lorenzo, but I guess when I look at what AK Steel and US Steel have done recently or reported recently I should say they have obviously got a lot of contracts in their order book and the analysis that we have done suggest that those guys are kind of realizing HRC prices, which might be sort of $50 or $60 above the actual spot price, so eventually the contract price of these customers are selling at is going to have to catch up to kind of spot price reality, and I am just wondering sort of what the embedded expectations are on that curve, be it, either the index price or Mittal's average realized price.

Lourenco Goncalves - Chairman of the Board, President, CEO, Principal Executive Officer
Look, the expectation that prices will continue to go back up, because my expectation is that imported steel is unfairly traded into the United States, will go away and the steel mills AK Steel, included ArcelorMittal, include, the US Steel, included, the Essar Algoma included, we will be able to recover their sales prices to a decent level, because that is just fair and just, so that is my expectation at this point.

Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse
Okay. I would certainly agree with that too, but just at the beginning of the year you had talked about I think in embedded assumption of 575 or 580 or somewhere in that neighborhood, I assume that we are a bit lower than that now. Is it possible to give us that number or is that not something you want to discuss?

Kelly Tompkins - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President
Nathan, we are a bit lower, but at this point we are not trying to provide that detail. You will see further disclosure in our Q, but it is slightly lower than what you embedded in your assumption.

Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse
Okay. No problem. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

Lourenco Goncalves - Chairman of the Board, President, CEO, Principal Executive Officer
**Nathan, before you go, just a reminder, you have an EBITDA target for Cliffs Natural Resource for the year of $170 million. In Q1 alone and Q1 is the frozen quarter, is the quarter that we are not shipping, because you can walk between here and your home country in Canada, you know that.**

Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse
Australia, but yes.

Lourenco Goncalves - Chairman of the Board, President, CEO, Principal Executive Officer
Even with this difficulties, we are able to generate $94 million reasonable in Q1, so now based on your EBITDA target, I am $76 million away from reaching your EBITDA target and I have three quarters to do it just a reminder.

Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse
Sure. No problems. We will take another look at the model. Thanks for the feedback, Lourenco.

Lourenco Goncalves - Chairman of the Board, President, CEO, Principal Executive Officer
**Yes. Take a look at your price target as well, because you went from 10 to 1, baked into your report the assumption that Cliffs Natural Resource by now would be would be bankrupt, so you were wrong. I am not bankrupt, I am not heading to bankruptcy. Your assumptions are all wrong and the outcome has been bad so far.**

Nathan Littlewood - Credit Suisse

On the one hand, more than half of all gold mined is turned into jewelry, so I would expect increased demand to translate into higher material costs.  But on the other hand, I would expect demand for a luxury good like gold jewelry to peak in times of economic prosperity, when people have more disposable income, yet gold generally underperforms when the stock market is booming.

Another thing to note is that before the oil crash that started in August 2014, none of these companies consistently beat earnings. Now they all do, all the time. Since August 2014, Chevron has beaten 3 times in a row (so has Exxon and Total), before August 2014 Chevron beat once in 7 quarters (similar trends in all of the big oil producers.)

------  
  
By MICHAEL J. CASEY April 29, 2015 11:04 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is one of two lead investors in a $50 million funding round for bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd.  
  
Goldman adds its name to a growing list of Wall Street institutions exploring digital-currency technology’s potential to provide faster and cheaper financial transactions and payments.  
  
Circle, based in Boston, uses bitcoin-based systems to allow customers to digitally store money and transfer it to and from other people and merchants.  
  
The new $50 million injection comes on top of $26 million in prior financing founds for Circle and, according to people familiar with the deal, values the startup at around $200 million.  
  
Goldman declined to comment about its investment beyond a brief statement in the news release from Tom Jessop, managing director of the investment bank’s Principal Strategic Investments Group. He said the investment bank sees “significant opportunities in companies and solutions that have the promise to transform global markets through technical innovation.”  
    
Circle said in a statement that the investment bank’s co-lead investor was China-based IDG Capital Partners, an early investor in Chinese Internet giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc. The firm’s involvement reflects a new push from Circle to break into the Chinese market.  
  
The funding news coincides with Circle’s move to allow consumers to hold traditional currencies in their accounts in addition to bitcoin. Chief Executive Jeremy Allaire said Circle will start with dollar offerings but then provide Chinese yuan accounts and other currencies once it can do so practically and compliantly.  
  
Also joining the investment round were Circle’s existing investors, including Breyer Capital, General Catalyst Partners, Accel Partners and Digital Currency Group. The firms’ individual contributions weren’t disclosed.  
  
Goldman’s commitment to Circle follows investments by the New York Stock Exchange, Spain’s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA and USAA Bank in San Francisco startup Coinbase, which runs a bitcoin exchange and competes with Circle in the market for bitcoin wallets, with which users store and send digital currency.  
  
Also, UBS AG this month said it would establish a special research lab to explore financial uses for the core technology underlying bitcoin—its so-called “blockchain” digital ledger.  
  
The strategy to offer dollar-based services marks an important shift for Circle, which began as a purely bitcoin wallet service. Mr. Allaire says the inclusion of fiat currencies is consistent with the firm’s founding philosophy.  
  
“We’ve always preached this idea of the hybrid digital economy where fiat currencies can move frictionlessly around the world using bitcoin as the free Internet payment network,” Mr. Allaire said in an interview.  
  
Dollar account holders’ funds will reside with Circle’s Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insured banking partner, Silicon Valley Bank of Santa Clara, Calif. It is expected that similar setups will be established with regulated banking entities as Circle establishes access to yuan, euros, yen or other currencies.  
  
Unlike other fast, low-cost, dollar-based digital money-transfer platforms such as PayPal or the digital money-sharing app Venmo, which operate exclusively inside their own “closed-loop” networks, Circle’s inclusion of a bitcoin connection allows users to send money outside the firm’s network. It achieves what Mr. Allaire describes as the goal of interoperability.  
  
Circle is trying a similar strategy in the Chinese market, where hundreds of millions of mobile-phone-toting consumers frequently use closed-loop services such as Alibaba’s Alipay service and the payment app attached to Tencent’s messaging service WeChat. Mr. Allaire called China “an extremely attractive market in terms of consumer behavior and in terms of scale,” highlighting the Chinese government’s desire to develop an economy that is led by consumers that spend their money globally.  
  
It is a similar bet to one being played by Beijing-based bitcoin exchange OKCoin, which is launching a “Superwallet” for storing yuan and other currencies, giving users the capacity to use those funds to purchase goods offered for sale in other countries in bitcoins.  
  
“The opportunities for cross-border payment activity and for digital money are exploding as we speak,” says Jim Breyer, a partner at Breyer Capital and Accel Partners—both early investors in Circle, who in the past has collaborated in Chinese investments with IDG.

So what else do you need to see?  Blythe Masters is working in bitcoin space, the first bitcoin exchange fund will begin trading soon, and now Goldman Sachs can't even afford to ignore bitcoin any longer.  
  
Berkshire Hathaway, 2.92% owner of Goldman Sachs, just caused Mr. Buffet to make his first investment in the emerging tech universe of cryptocurrency.  Why?  *Because it's a smart move!*  
  
It might hurt to admit that I'm right on this one, but I am.  2016 is going to see bitcoin prices way, **way** higher than piddly $220 each.  
  
The financial universe can only send you so many wakeup calls.  It would be foolish not to have at least 1% of your portfolio in bitcoin or bitcoin-related tech at this point.

15-04-30,"Cramer's Twenty-five Rules for Investing","Rule 1: Bulls, Bears Make Money, Pigs Get Slaughtered
It's essential for all traders to know when to take some off the table.
 
Rule 2: It's OK to Pay the Taxes
Stop fearing the tax man and start fearing the loss man because gains can be fleeting.
 
Rule 3: Don't Buy All at Once
To maximize your profits, stage your buys, work your orders and try to get the best price over time.
 
Rule 4: Buy Damaged Stocks, Not Damaged Companies
There are no refunds on Wall Street, so do your research and focus your trades on damaged stocks rather than companies.
 
Rule 5: Diversify to Control Risk
If you control the downside and diversify your holdings, the upside will take care of itself.
 
Rule 6: Do Your Stock Homework
Before you buy any stock, it's important to research all aspects of the company.
 
Rule 7: No One Made a Dime by Panicking
There will always be a better time to leave the table, so it is best to avoid the fleeing masses.
 
Rule 8: Buy Best-of-Breed Companies
Investing in the more expensive stock is invariably worth it because you get piece of mind.
 
Rule 9: Defend Some Stocks, Not All
When trading gets tough, pick your favorite stocks and defend only those.
 
Rule 10: Bad Buys Won't Become Takeovers
Bad companies never get bids, so it's the good fundamentals you need to focus on.
 
Rule 11: Don't Own Too Many Names
It can be constraining, but it's better to have a few positions you know well and like. More
 
Rule 12: Cash Is for Winners
If you don't like the market or have anything compelling to buy, it's never wrong to go with cash.

Rule 13: No Woulda, Shoulda, Couldas
This damaging emotion is destructive to the positive mindset needed to make investment decisions.
 
Rule 14: Expect, Don't Fear Corrections
It is not always clear when a correction will strike, so expect and be prepared for one at all times.
 
Rule 15: Don't Forget Bonds
It's important to watch more than stocks, and bonds are stocks' direct competition.
 
Rule 16: Never Subsidize Losers With Winners
Any trader stuck in this position would do well to sell sinking stocks and wait a day.
 
Rule 17: Check Hope at the Door
Hope is emotion, pure and simple, and trading is not a game of emotion.
 
Rule 18: Be Flexible
Recognize and be open to the unexpected shifts in the market because business, by nature, is dynamic, not static.
 
Rule 19: When the Chiefs Retreat, So Should You
High-level executives don't quit a company for personal reasons, so that is a sign something is wrong.
 
Rule 20: Giving Up on Value Is a Sin
If you don't have patience, think about letting someone who does run your money.
 
Rule 21: Be a TV Critic
Accept that what you hear on television is probably right, but no more than that.
 
Rule 22: Wait 30 Days After Preannouncements
Preannouncements signal ongoing weakness, wait 30 days to see if anything has gotten better before you pull the trigger to buy.
 
Rule 23: Beware of Wall Street Hype
Never underestimate the promotion machine because analysts get behind stocks and can keep them propelled in an up direction well beyond reason.
 
Rule 24: Explain Your Picks
Buying stocks is a solitary event, too solitary in fact, so always make sure you can articulate your reasoning to someone else.

Rule 25: There's Always a Bull Market
It's OK if you have to work hard to find it, just don't default to what's in bear mode because you are time-constrained or intellectually lazy.",4

I'm open to other kinds of investments but I lack experience and knowledge of them. So I come to you for advice.
&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


I just graduated and have no college loans nor any kind of debt.
&amp;nbsp;

I'm earning $130,000/yr.... after taxes I get just over 6k/month. SF hurts.

I put at least 4k/mo into my savings and am almost at 40k saved.

I keep reading about all the maintenance and time consuming things you need to do as a land lord but are these things really going to take up more than a few hours a week at worst? And to anyone that argues time is valuable... I can sacrifice a night or two of Netflix. If anything goes wrong with plumbing or another utility isn't it as easy as calling someone to fix it?

I agree that I can't time the market but it also doesn't make sense to me to invest in the market after a 6 year rally.  
I'm not trying to argue that stocks are overvalued and set to fall, just that they don't seem to provide much reward for the risk and that I think the valuation of the market when you enter provides some indication for what future returns you could expect. 
Then again, what are the alternatives?
