Stocks: Here is my pick from the list of high dividend stocks of 2015

ETFs: Or, I can go with an ETF portfolio

Which one would you choose? My starting budget is $50K, and current tax bracket is 28% if that helps.

Recently they announced that they [don't have enough authorized shares to cover the remaining warrant exercises](http://biz.yahoo.com/e/150921/gbsn8-k.html) and that within 90 days they need to obtain stockholder approval to somehow increase the number of authorized shares (I'm assuming reverse split is prob the most likely option). But what happens if they can't get approval? What if they simply cannot increase the amount of authorized shares enough to cover all the warrant exercises? Will they basically just keep splitting the stock and letting it drift to $0 over and over until all the warrants have been exercised? Can they be delisted from the exchange?

NOBL - I like the idea of getting some dividends a few times a year, very diversified, think its solid as a safe choice not gonna make millions but at some point probably a few thousand.

WPCary - dividend, this is my risky choice just saw some stuff on motley fool that say its a great pick, i dunno, just want this so i keep the balance of index/one stock. 

VMRGX - Looks like a great time to buy and keeps a lot of companies, fairly risky but in the long term I dont see how this can be bad unless america collapses and then it doesnt really matter what I get

VHT - health care. Another diversified risk, more years more sickness more solutions I'm willing to see where this goes in 10 years. Last 10 years is 10% which is of course beautiful.

It's come to my attention that USO and other crude oil ETF's are a crappy way to do this, since they track the daily spot price, and horribly underperform over the long term as they pay to roll over futures contacts.

So, my questions:

1. If I buy a long dated call - say, $13 to buy 100 barrels at $53/barrel by December 2023 - do I actually have to take delivery of the oil at that price on that date? What happens if oil stays below that price for much longer? Can I somehow get rid of these options, even at a big loss, so I don't have to worry about taking delivery of crude oil?

However, Pastor and Stambaugh from Chicago and Wharton argue that this thinking does not account for uncertainty about future returns and that in fact, **stocks are not safer in the long-run**. This is true despite taking into account the mean-reversion in stock prices.

For example, looking [at this chart comparison](http://i.imgur.com/QQeuirT.png) between CHTTX and JORNX makes it really difficult to know which one has performed better over the past 2 years.  It looks like JORNX is far and away the better performer, but the big price drops in CHTTX the end of 2013 &amp; 2014 are due to a total of $11.00 in dividends that were paid out.  If you reinvested those dividends, you wouldn't has seen those big declines in value in your portfolio.

They announced an asset sale this morning for C$205mm.  The stock is up 10%, but I think that's still an under-reaction.  

My back of the envelop calculation is that enterprise value (market cap + debt) before the sale was C$2.5 billion.  Effectively they sold 3% of their assets at a price of 8% of their enterprise value.  The spread between the two should be added to the market cap.  That would imply an increased value of 15 to 20 cents, when it's actually only up 5 cents.  Also, oil is up which should further increase it.

15-10-01,Question about HTC stock.,"First of all:  Hello everyone, i hope you have a great Day! :)

So, im looking into investing in HTC Stock because i think that Virtual Reality is going to revolutionize the Entertainment (or at least the Gaming) Industry. 

After researching, i found out that the only HTC stock that i can buy from my Bank in Germany is this one: [HTC CORP SP GDR REGS](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=7583206). 


My question is: Whats the difference between the one above and this one : [HTC Corp](https://www.google.com/finance?q=TPE%3A2498&amp;sq=htc&amp;sp=1&amp;ei=9kQNVpGhD4aUUNH-svAF) 


And more importantly: Will the HTC SP GDR REGS stock rise if the HTC Virtual Reality Headset HTC Vive is successful? 


As you may have already noticed im kinda new to the stock market, so any help or advice is greatly appreciated!",0

15-10-01,Can someone please tell me if I Questraded properly? I have some money and I wish to be reckless with it.,"Everyone at /r/investing was all ""have you paid your student debts off""

NO. I haven't, but I don't want to wait 30 years to mess around with stocks I know little to nothing about on the chance I luck out and get to feel like I know what I'm doing.

So, I was wondering if anyone here could please help me learn what the hell is going on.

I set up a Questrade account and did all the documentation and funded it with my $1500 account to have fun with (it was a gift, this is how I'd like to spend that gift rather than on beer or shoes).

I am investing in TSX because I'm in Canada and I don't want to buy USD stocks because the loonie is worth approximately nothing at the moment.

So - I pick (and by that I mean I read a bunch of stuff other people think online) my shiny company I'd like - for my first ever trade: TA.TO it's Transalta - they lost a lot of their value and maybe people still need coal, so I am like yes: this is the perfect buy, it's going to at least quadruple in value by next month I'd imagine :)

So ... I'm in questrade and I open up the IQ thing, and find my stock and there's the BUY/SELL button, I press it - it has a bunch of settings I don't understand, anyway, I leave stuff as the default because that's probably cool and I buy 100 stocks of TA.TO at $6.21 each. 

So then in my ""open orders"" section it says Status ""offered"", I've set the duration of this offer as ""Day"" - nothing changes for a bit, I go to bed.

This morning it has moved to ""Accepted"" hurrah! But in my questrade ""positions and balances"" pages it still says my account is 100% ""cash"" and shows no ""positions""? 

* Is this stock mine?
* Do I have to do anything else at this point?
* What is ""Fill price"" and why is it 0?
* What is ""Fill quantity"" and how is it different from ""quantity"" (fill qty is also 0 unsurprisingly).

Here's a picture of what I've got.

15-10-01,"[VLKAY] How far will it drop before it's time to buy?","Speculative, obviously.

Volkswagen has been on a steady decline since the onset of Dieselgate. It's silly to think that this conflict and deception will destroy the company -- VW has the second largest market cap after Toyota, bigger than GM and Ford. 

At some point, wounds will heal -- VW's product line will have changed (or their diesels will be retrofitted) and people will forget this drama, but the question is how far will VW drop before that happens?

I owned VLKAY a year and a half ago at $38.00. I sold at $54.00 this summer. Now it's back down to $23.xx, and I'm thinking about buying again -- but I'd like to wait until a solution is released, so we know the extent of the damages. The problem, however, is whether that will be too late -- you don't want to buy when the climb starts back up.

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this.  I recently just opened a Robinhood account (I typically use Fidelity for my Roth IRA + 401(k) and various ESPP).

Here is my scenario:  If I can only manage to deposit $75-150 / 2-4 weeks, do you think it would be a great idea to just buy stocks (T, KO, JNJ, PG, WFC) that are not entirely over my price point here, or should I just save as much as I can in this account and try to go for the giants (GOOG, AMZN, AAPL)?

Also, is this an advantageous strategy to use Robinhood to buy individual stocks as opposed to my Fidelity individual account where I suppose I can buy mutual funds (VTI)?  I was trying to avoid any fees possible because with the little amount that I am gradually investing with, I figured Robinhood would be a good idea because there are no fees.

15-10-01,(2002) The Nifty-Fifty Re-Revisited,"Nice history lesson here about the purported ""Nifty Fifty"" (there was never an ""official"" list) and their returns in the following 20 years after 1972

http://economics-files.pomona.edu/GarySmith/Nifty50/Nifty50.html

&gt;A fundamental investment maxim is that, ""A great company is not necessarily a great stock."" No matter how good or bad a company’s management, no matter how large or small a company’s profits, no matter how bright or bleak a company’s prospects, the attractiveness of a company’s stock depends on its price. At some price, a great company’s stock is expensive; at some price, a lousy company’s stock is cheap.

&gt;To illustrate this fundamental principle, people often recall the early 1970s when institutional investors were infatuated by the Nifty Fifty—a small group of “one-decision” stocks, companies so appealing that their stocks should always be bought and never sold, regardless of price. Among these select few were Avon, Disney, McDonald’s, Polaroid, and Xerox. Each was a leader in its field with a strong balance sheet, high profit rates, and double-digit growth rates.

&gt;But is such a company’s stock worth any price, no matter how high? In late 1972, Xerox traded for 49 times earnings, Avon for 65 times earnings, Polaroid for 91 times earnings. When the stock market crashed in 1973, the Nifty Fifty defied gravity for a while, held up by institutional enthusiasm that created a two-tiered market of the richly priced Nifty Fifty and the depressed rest. Then, in the memorable words of a Forbes columnist, the Nifty Fifty were taken out and shot one by one. From their 1972–1973 highs to their 1974 lows, Xerox fell 71%, Avon 86%, and Polaroid 91%.

Basically, the Nifty Fifty as a group DID under-perform the S&amp;P 500 from 1972-2002, but not by as much as popular perception would lead you to believe.

&gt;In comparison to the S&amp;P 500’s 12.01% annualized return over this period, a portfolio of these 50 stocks would have had annualized returns of 11.64% (a frozen portfolio that is initially equally weighted) or 11.85% (rebalanced monthly to be equally weighted).

What I took away from this is that price still matters, even when you are choosing from great companies BUT that you can pay a really high price for great companies and still do OK in absolute terms.",6

After watching Ichan's doomsday message and [hearing him on CNBC](http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000391298) I decided to make my first money-backed foray into speculative options. I'm writing this up as something for you to laugh at and for me to learn from. I'd really like some feedback on my construction of this ""strangle"" from a ""how options work"" standpoint.

I wanted a way to play a crash precipitated by the high yield bond market (junk bonds) but I wanted a hedge in case the sky doesn't fall. I focused on OTM options to try to get in cheap-ish. I didn't want to write options because, for me, that would be a YOLO to far.

First, I looked [here](http://etfdb.com/type/bond/junk/) to find ETFs that track junk bonds.

I settled on [HYG](http://etfdb.com/etf/HYG/) because of it's high volume and apparently shitty performance.

Next, I used the thinkorswim Risk Profile tool to find a profile that looked like the type of yacht I want to captain;

http://puu.sh/kv1zu/a7ff2a9358.png

    HYG160115P70 +15 @0.46
    HYG160115C87 +3 @0.54

Here's what I *think* is happening with this;

(p is the probability according to the risk profile tool)

* Between 82.75 and 87.62 I lose @ expiration if I hold that long. 
* Above 87.62 I start breaking even if doomsday doesn't come (p~10%)
* Below 82.75 I start breaking even+profit (p~55%)
* Below 69.50 and what kind of beer do you want me to stock the yacht with? (p~5%)

~~I think my risk is limited to a max around $116.~~ My max risk is $852

As of today, I've covered the initial spread loss on the purchase, which gives me a feeling of security, perhaps a false one.

If you know of fundamental reasons I should jettison this position immediately and resume my life as a landlubber, please, *please* don't hold back.

FAEIX

Should I simply invest in FAEIX based on that lowest ER?

I've been actively watching about fifteen different stocks over the past couple weeks, and after EXXI's news yesterday I figured it would be a good time to buy. Unfortunately I held off because I told myself that I didn't want to invest in the oil industry because of the volatility. But this morning after seeing it open at  1.11 I bought in at 1.12. 

Five minutes later, stock up to almost 1.20. This SHOULD HAVE BEEN my selling point. I had 200 shares in (laugh it up, you rich bastards) and was feeling good about my 20 dollar gain. Should have just peaced the scene and realized that a $200 dollar speculation isn't going to net me $50+ dollars in a day. But I held onto it.

A few hours later, Exxi starts creeping back down. I hold. Keep telling myself that the middle of the day shouldn't be the time to sell and keep holding. EXII keeps dropping, so I (semi) panic sell at 1.06. ($10 dollar loss). 

I guess what I learned the most from this experience was to 1) set an exit price. I had never seriously considered how important it would be to know WHEN I needed to sell -- and 2) don't panic. If I would've relaxed I could've sold for around 1.10 towards the end of the day. Oh well.

15-10-01,"The consequences of Fed's Zero Interest Rate Policy and Are we Headed for a Market Slump?","A lot of people are asking, is the Fed's ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy) going to affect us? And is the damage done already too big? Also, is Carl ICahn right about anticipating a broader market slump in the coming months?

I will attempt to answer these questions while avoiding spiraling into a ZeroHedge-Tyler-Durdenesque demagoguery.

&amp;nbsp;

**First, is the Fed's ZIRP having an effect on anything?**

The short answer is yes, and this is only the beginning. Take Glencore for example: the company invested heavily using low-interest bonds, and bought commodites like there was no tomorrow. Glencore somehow managed to pile up $30 billion in debt. Now that commodity prices have slumped, and Glencore cannot finance that debt any longer, the company is in big trouble.
 
http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GLEN:LN

http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/09/30/444531514/as-commodity-prices-slide-layoffs-and-restructurings-follow

**Takeaway: Companies who used a lot of debt to expand and are dependent on commodities and industrial growth are in a world of pain. This explains why Catapillar, Alcoa, and Glencore, Anglo American are suffering.**

&amp;nbsp;

**Second, is the damage from ZIRP already too big?**

Yes, it seems so. Fed should have started raising interest rates a year ago. If you look at a few charts, you can see there are now bubbles in many sectors:

Student Debt:
http://ftalphaville.ft.com/files/2015/09/US-fed-govt-holdings-of-student-debt.png

Corporate Debt:
https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/NCBDBIQ027S

China and Emerging Markets Debt:
http://online.wsj.com/media/EM_Corporate_Debt.png

http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/09/29/imf-flashes-warning-lights-for-18-trillion-in-emerging-market-corporate-debt/

http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-01/these-charts-show-the-big-change-in-chinese-corporate-debt-since-2007

**Takeaway: There are many bubbles that have yet to burst. China's stock market was the first major wake-up call. What will happen when corporations or emerging economies cannot service their debt? We have had some wealth destruction, but there is still a lot more to come. We have seen the effects of wealth destruction as companies have tightened up their advertising budgets, affecting DotComs that are heavily depended on them such as LinkedIn, Yelp, Twitter. Facebook and Google seem to be some of the few that are doing well.**

http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/08/27/as-growth-at-yelps-local-ads-business-slows-mobile-ad-growth-takes-center-stage/

&amp;nbsp;

**Lastly, is Carl Icahn right about a market slump?**

Yes, at this point a market slump looks unavoidable. Carl Icahn doesn't have a perfect track record calling market crashed, but he is right about a global slowdown right now. He called this recent correction, even when we were near the market peak back in June:

http://www.profitconfidential.com/news/stock-market-crash-you-wont-believe-what-carl-icahn-just-said/

Lets take a closer look at why he could be right. This is one of my favorite charts, the weekly intermodal rail traffic. The rail traffic is higher when companies are buying inventory, signaling a healthy economy. When the traffic slows down, it's an indicator of trouble ahead.

http://ycharts.com/indicators/us_intermodal_units_weekly_rail_traffic

It's hard to see because of the cyclical nature of the chart, but this September we had the biggest drops in rail traffic since the last recession, and this week's recovery numbers are weaker than they have been since 2008. 

Moreover, the BRIC countries are all slumping, Europe's feeble recovery is slowing down, and countries with commodity-based economies (Canada and Australia) are hurting. I look at Canada and Australia as a barometer of global growth, since both countries have huge cache of natural resources. Better global growth = higher need for resources.

http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/08/european-economy-guide

http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2a6c3d6a-0f62-11e5-897e-00144feabdc0.html

Furthermore, the Saudi government shares this pessimism in global equities. They have been liquidating their assets at a very high rate.

http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/09/28/2141029/on-those-diminishing-petrodollar-flows-saudi-edition/

**Takeaway for LONG-TERM INVESTORS: Don't despair, if you are a long-term investor, ignore the volatility. Buffet is not worried about the daily and weekly swings in the market, and neither should you be. Volatility does not affect a good asset's value in the long term. This may be a good time to snap up some stocks for the long term, even Carl Icahn has been adding some energy companies to his portfolio. Besides energy, there are some battered stocks that are now good values, Stores, Lulu-lemon, Micron to name a few.**

**Takeaway for TRADERS: Expect Volatility to remain elevated, regardless of market action, exploit this distortion in Implied Volatility (IV) using options. What I mean is that  IV is high for puts relative to calls, near term IV is higher vs further dated IV, causing an inverted structure. Types of trades that can work: Selling OTM puts, or put spreads and owning calls; Sell near-term IV, buy further-dated IV options.**

I see the new equity buyer rushing to convert his warrants to shares (the upcoming board meeting) and he's doing it at a loss right now but I expect he wants to get some of his money back on FDA and I see his shares entering the market on that play.  And I see a lot of potential to get burned by this stock if you haven't looked pretty hard at how you're going to play it.

So I'm curious.   How does WSB think AMDA is going to play its FDA decision and I'm curious how many of you have actually thought this through.

Therefore, my suggestion is for the wiki to be made a sticky. These newcomers don't read shit, think every basic question posed is the first time anyone has ever thought to ask it, never bother to search old posts, don't notice the side-bar wiki, etc etc... Meanwhile their answers are all within the wiki.

At least with a stickied wiki, it's front and center, and can help reduce the posts. ""New here? Read the wiki"" hidden halfway down the sidebar, and looking extra inconspicuous does not accomplish anything. Hell based on words alone, that doesn't even sound like it'll help people with beginner investing problems... But rather is just a reddit how-to guide.

I'd like to think 1 sticky doesn't take up too much screen real estate. Plenty of pointless things already get stickied. 

I'm all for helping people out, but it does get extra annoying when people can't even be bothered to do one second of research for their ""problems"".

15-10-02,Uncorrelated Asset Methods,"I guess I got the idea from Dalio, who talked about investing in uncorrelated assets. The problem he talked about is that correlations change based on marco-economic happenings. I'm personally not worried about anticipating deleveraging in Singapore, I just like to find some assets that generally (over the long long term) track in the opposite direction of equity shares of american corporations, particularly when things crash. I'm wondering if anybody tries to do this around here, or something like it.

Personally I try to be 50% equity/reits with the other 50% being assets that sort of move (over time) opposite of the equities. I stay away from shinny pretty rocks, fracked earth juice, countries flooded with refugees or covered in rain forests, areas raped by the Khans, and also things you can eat. Keeping it simple, red white and blue. Equity/REIT ------ us debt, usd, crude, vix. Specifics would bore you.

I'm just wondering if any of you do this kind of thing, and what your methods/allocations/entry points/exit points are? 

Index ETFs only? Stocks? Do you max leverage (because of uncorrelated hedging)? Average down? Use futures? Options? Do you hold and hold and hold, or swing? Months, weeks, what? Mean reversion? Trend following? How do you manage allocation.

[When the cash machine is broke](https://medium.com/@stockflare/when-the-cash-machine-is-broke-9f4fcc3e0610)

PS: to avoid Blogspam, full text is below.

***

**When the cash machine is broke**

*The dangers of buying a stock whose earnings are less than its dividends*

There is no data on the future. And no “system” works consistently on the stock market. This keeps the professionals guessing and often scares the rest of us. But as Warren Buffett is at pains to repeat:

&gt; The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future.

Ignore the cash flow potential of a business at your peril. Perhaps the brightest signal on cash flows are the dividends you get.

**When dividends are higher than earnings**

Dividends can only be paid out of profit. So it’s rare to see dividends that are higher than earnings, but it does happen.

In the case where the board is giving a *special* dividend, there is rarely a case for alarm. If fact the market usually cheers the extra cash payment.

But if earnings have fallen, albeit temporarily, and the board decides not to cut the dividend, there may be cause to sell out. It’s a warning signal. Not fool proof, but it’s a flag all the same.

**A warning? Why?**

It all comes down to the word temporary. Look what the recent collapse in oil prices, has done to the earnings of the oil majors. Is this temporary or permanent?

If the hit to earnings is temporary, then a company’s board may decide to keep the dividend payment flat on the previous year. Even if forecast earnings falls below dividends, the board can dip into the company’s reserves to maintain the dividend. If they decide to live with a dividend / earnings imbalance, the signal to shareholders and the stock market is one of confidence. Confidence that the long-term cash potential of the company is intact.

Sticking with the example of the oil majors. Only one of them, Chevron, is in the dividend danger zone.
Earnings forecasts for 2015 are down 71% to $3.30 a share. But the expected dividend for 2015 is $4.31 a share, which exceeds earnings.

But with earnings forecast to expand again in 2016, to $4.45 a share, the dividend / earnings imbalance looks temporary. At least that is the forecast of the professionals on Wall Street.

**But what if the forecasts are wrong?**

If a temporary fall in earnings turns out to be permanent, then the impact is usually bad. Obvious, you might say? Yes, it is simple, the future cash flow potential has fallen.

The problem, though, is the speed the stock market reacts. It’s rare that earnings forecasts are cut, before the stock falls. Usually the stock prices falls before the professionals on Wall Street get to change their forecasts.

Similarly, by the time you realise that the dividend is going to be cut, and that the fall in earnings isn’t temporary, it’s also to late. You’d be:

&gt; Shutting the stable door, after the horse has bolted.

So what are you to do? Be vigilant. If the fundamentals of a business you’ve invested in start to get worse, reconsider your investment. It’s not a must sell, but you need to ask yourself one simple, but troubling, question:

&gt; If I didn’t own this stock today, would I buy it?

If the answer is no, then why on earth do you still own it? Don’t get emotionally attached to any investment.

**Let’s run the numbers!**

I ran the numbers for UK stocks back in March. There were 7 companies, worth over $1 billion, that were forecast to pay higher dividends than earnings. Two were giants, BP and Vodafone. Here’s what the picture looked like at the time.

Roll forward 6 months, and what’s happened to the earnings and dividend forecasts? Six of the seven companies have seen the forecast earnings decline with four of them seeing forecast dividends decline.

Did the changes in forecasts impact their prices? Yes, performance was universally negative.

Though we need to put this into the context of the stock market. In the UK, the big-cap index, FTSE 100 is off 14% over the same period. And the mid-cap index, FTSE 250 is off 4%.

**It’s just a flag, not a “system”**

So yes, the dividend / earnings imbalance was a flag, but in some cases (CWC, TalkTalk and Vodafone) the stocks have performed reasonably when compared to the market. How can that be?

Share prices are driven by two factors: the fundamentals, and; sentiment. It’s entirely possible for the fundamentals of a business to get worse, but for sentiment to not change/ even improve. Sentiment can be a powerful driver of stock prices in the short term. Booms and busts being extreme examples. To quote Warren Buffett’s mentor, Benjamin Graham:

&gt; In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.

So yes, it’s a flag that something bad may happen. But like any rule of thumb, there are many times it doesn’t hold. Especially in the short term.

**Forget the past, what about today?**

I hate price charts, as they tell me what I should have done 3 months ago, not what I should do today. Equally, you can accuse me of telling you about the fall of 7 major UK companies, after the fact. Your criticism is valid.

So why don’t we run the numbers today? Both US and UK.

*Dividends &gt; Earnings in the UK*

I doubt anyone’s surprised to see a mining and an oil stock on the list. Though a pharma and an insurance one is a little more mystifying.

*Dividends &gt; Earnings in the US*

The US list is oils heavy. Plus, given the size of the US stock market, I’ve only posted the 12 stocks with a value over $25 billion. To see the full list of 76 stocks over $5 billion with a dividend / earnings imbalance, please click this link for the data.

**And…what should you do?**

We don’t make recommendations or provide advice. We are highlighting a rule of thumb, a cautionary flag. So let’s roll forward 6 months, and see how the 18 companies above deal with their imbalance! I suspect it’s be a mixed bag.

And, if you are scratching your head and wondering what you should do? Well… be vigilant. To quote the economist John Maynard Keynes:

&gt; When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do?

So if the fundamentals for any invest you’ve made change, it’ll be time to think again.

The breach, disclosed by the companies Thursday, covered about 15 million people. It included information on T-Mobile subscribers, former customers as well as consumers that applied for service or device financing at the wireless carrier in roughly the last two years.

The exposed data included names, addresses and birth dates as well as encrypted Social Security numbers, driver's license or passport numbers. The companies said credit card or banking information wasn't compromised.

T-Mobile said the breach was discovered on Sept. 15, and it was notified about a week later. In a public letter, T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere said the encryption of the downloaded information may have been compromised.

""We will institute a thorough review of our relationship with Experian,"" he said. Meanwhile, any T-Mobile customer or applicant can get two years of free credit monitoring services from Experian itself. T-Mobile said the data was stored by Experian and was required by law to be held for a minimum of 25 months.

In a statement, Experian said the incident ""included access"" to a computer server with T-Mobile customer data and that ""no other clients' data was accessed."" The company said its consumer-credit-database, which holds records on tens of millions of Americans, wasn't affected. An Experian spokesman said no other servers were affected by the incident.",55

2. Improving economic indicators are likely to trigger the Fed's decision to raise rates.
3. Therefore, improving economic indicators are causing people to pull money out of the market, causing it to decline.
EDIT: Corollary to #3... declining economic indicators (today at least) are causing people to put more money into the market because of the perception that interest rates will stay low.

1. SPX go up 3% less than 1% of the time.

3. monday and tuesday historically are terrible.
4. Terrible numbers released, crashes saved by some buybacks. Just shows desperation
5. Beginnings of months usually start with a hard push followed by a regression.

I think the likely worst case possibility would be a sideways monday, at which point, I'd have to throw a 1.25% trail on it (its value is 900k dollars after all)

I'm gonna close a few shares every .49 % all the way down until I've closed all 10. At each point of sale, I'm going to attach 2 stop sells 49% above each limit buy, so that (if they go back up momentarily) I can sell them short and buy them once again on the way back down.

15-10-02,"Get you shit together and buy $TACT, mad DD inside.","I'll start off by saying this: Unless you want a little rowboat instead of a yacht that you can watch John Cena strip on; listen up. Mortgage your house, sell your children, your kidney and your foreskin because you're gun' need all the money you can get. Put all your cash into $TACT and profit like crazy you fuckers. 

If you follow this advice, you'll go through 4 simple steps

1) Buying TACT  
2) Selling TACT  
3) Realizing *MAD GAINZ*  
4) Buying a yacht

Now lets cut the shit and funny business, I'll let you in on some of their financials. 

Revenue you may ask? Do they ever revenue. Not only a little bit or revenue but our friend Transact Technologies revenues up a smooth $18 million in June 2015 alone, and, some $200 million a year. Not bad for a company that makes printers. Yeah, fucking printers. 

Cash reserves? They've practically got a license to print money. TACT has a cool $6 million in the bank as we speak. Again, not bad for a printer company. No wonder my ink costs so fucking much. 

What the fuck to they make? Printers, yeah, but not just any printers, super high tech printers that only print John Cena nudes (can someone invent this please). No, they make fancy printers for large corporations and casinos who think they're better than a good ol' HP. 

Well, actually they design specific machines for specific tasks for thousands of companies across the globe; Samsung is just one of the names they're contracted by. Get this, because the printers are exclusive to them, you need parts, ink, paper? Too bad, you can't go to Staples, give us $100k and we'll fix it for you, it's like the Apple of printers. 

Okay, why should I buy this? First of all, I stake no position in their company other than the shares that I own, so, I couldn't give any fewer fucks if you buy this (other than I typed this out so.....) Yeah. It's not some pharmaceutical company that's soon to get FDA approval on their cum-color-changing pill, but they've got a profitable business and a good business plan. 

Not only are they the only company that really does this, but, people are gonna stop needing printers any time soon, so, as long as there's environment to destroy, there's money to be made here. Also, they've gains like 30% in the last month or so and about 45% in the last 4 months, so, yeah. 

Unless you want some dollar menu blowjob instead of fucking Kate Upton riding your dick, buy $TACT and do it ***NOW*** (by ""NOW"" I mean on Monday when the market opens). Also, while you're at that, maybe you plebs could also pick up some $GPL, $WHZ, $SMT, $MNI, $NADL, $TGP, $OIBR, $NSLP and if you're really a baller $ZINC. I'm not gonna do the same in depth YOLO analysis and I did but trust me. I think they're gonna gain.

15-10-02,Skechers (SKX) or ABInBev (BUD),"I recently purchased positions in these two stocks and was wondering if anyone else shares a position in one of these two. What are your thoughts on them? I'll share mine below...

For Skechers, I like that they are second in shoe sales to Nike but only hold 5% of the market share. This gives them massive room for growth and I can see Skechers changing their ""Old man shoe"" image to a more progressive and socially acceptable shoe for younger people haha. I see them only gaining more marketshare of shoe sales. Also, they have a 3:1 stock split coming up in 2 weeks. This suggests management is confident they can attract new investors into Skechers with the lower share price. This should add a nice little bump to the share price for a short term gain. Again, from what I see Skechers is being ambitious to expand and adapt as a company, which means they have potential to grow.

For InBev, They honestly just own my drinks of choice and it gives me the opportunity to invest in something that I am passionate about and believe in the product. The 4% dividend yield is also nice. ",3

15-10-02,How to trade instantly in RH,"Since some of y'all noobs use Robinhood like me, I thought I share this little and easy trick.

1) First of all, always do limit order and stop limit. Never Stop or market order unless you really wanna yolo.

2) Get your Robinhood app, find the stock you wanna yolo.

3) Open ThinkorSwim (might need an account at TDA). Fucking type the ticker into ""Market Depth"" at the bottom left.

4) Look at the Bid and Ask, set your Robinhood limit order to 1 cent or more higher the Bid price of ""Composite"" or lower if you expect the price to drop some more. 

5) Execute order in Robinhood.

6) Order completed almost instantly to your benefit.

-----------------------


If you are desperate as fuck to get those shares tho, set your order price to the ""Ask"" price, but that's basically what Robinhood fucking does when you choose market order. Nah, my nigga. Sellers be desperate, they will bite! Set it near, at or below the Bid price. That's the only way you will make quick and profitable trades on Robinhood. The quotes on Robinhood are way too slow and they only show the Ask price so even if you set your limit order to what Robinhood is showing you pay a higher price than smarter people do, not to mention they don't update quotes in real time at all so the price might already have dropped and you fool bought that shit high like a kite.

tl:dr Robinhood quotes are crap. Use a real-time tool that shows you bid and ask, go with the bid price or lower. Happy yolo, my RH friends.",8

15-10-02,"""Dont buy a stock because of XYZ because XYZ is already priced in!""",So I see a lot of people here and on other investing places telling someone not to buy a stock for a certain event because that event is already priced in and even if it goes well the stock could very well drop if it doesnt meet and possibly exceed expectations(depending on hype I guess). I think this is true but it is not the full story!   I herbey propose my theory of Cost Regressional Pricing Alertness Equality.  In short not only is that certain event priced in but the fact that it is priced in is also priced in! So the fact that an event could possibly lower the value of a stock if it doesnt meet expectations is priced in causing the price of the stock to go lower by about 82.7% of whatever gains it was making. For example if there was a company that had a stock on the market for $69 and suddenly it announced that it was teaming up with netflix and bernie sanders to plan a mars mission to search for dank memes and mr skeltal that would get priced in and the value of the stock should go to $420! But then because of this it would actually go to $130 but then the price would also go back up because the fact that the the price in is priced in would increase the stock 10% and the fact that this is priced in would decrease the stock 50%! And then its all turtles all the way down. And according yo my calculations when we calculate the limit as the number of price ins approaches infinity the final value of the stock will be worth $0 although due to error from certain values which had to be approximated the value has an error of +or- infinity. Not sure how it could be worth less than nothing though. Maybe that discovery will win me the nobel prize?    I still wouldnt buy AMDA though tbh or AMD. But that paper is still being worked on so I cant tell you my results. ,9

**INTRO**

-

/u/tedfor tried to tell us about this stock [at .475](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3m4erk/too_early_on_my_pwe_yolo/) at [.50](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3n3tyl/pwe_looking_good_this_morning/) and at [.55](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3n8k4r/pwe_is_running_up_again/) before [doing a true WSB I told you so at .60](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3n961b/i_told_you_fuckers/).   So is this the top?   Will we all be snickering at a .13 cent gain followed by a .50c loss or will we all be looking on in awe as /u/tedfor starts speccing out his yacht?   Lets peer into the crystal ball and see what the future holds in store.

-

**The Company**

-

Penn West Exploration is a Canadian oil and gas company.   Given the current oil market you'd expect them to be beat up, and they are.   Their big problem is that they were deeply in debt to the tune of 2 BILLION (with a B) Canadian dollars (that's 1.5B US) before the oil crisis hit and with the downturn they had less income to pay off that mountain of debt.

-

To their credit they have worked to reduce this liability by selling assets (to the tune of $800m Canadian thus far).   They have also suspended their .01c dividend which will save a few more million.  Also reducing their workforce 35%.

-

Our problem as investors is that shedding workers means oil fields are not being developed, Income from sold fields is not being realized and the overall valuation of the company has to be adjusted because of all this.  Remember, these sales of company assets are being done at the worst possible time (like having to sell your AMDA shares right now to pay taxes) and share holders aren't going to see any of this money either as a dividend or in the growth of the company.

-

The company is bringing its costs in line with its expenses.  It's shrunk its operating loss from .55c a share to just .06 in the last 3 months (as of July).  It's possible the company will achieve profitability by the end of the year.

-

There are 502m shares outstanding.   The cash on hand value of the company is .17c -- Canadian.   Fortunately there are other assets (land, income, etc).   Subtracting liabilities from assets (excluding shareholder equity) we get a realistic valuation of the company at $10.57 Canadian or $8.03 US.  That is, if the company liquidated today and gave all its cash to its share holders they would receive about 8 bucks US.   And you can get it for .60c a share US.

-

**Catalysts**

-

* Just people waking up to the fact that a 4b dollar company worth $8 share is on a fire sale for .60 -- might take a while for that to happen though.  A return to profitability in these lean times will help that happen.   Further debt pay downs should also highlight that.   Any increase in oil futures will highlight that.

* This shouldn't be a catalyst but it is.  **AT THESE PRICE LEVELS $PWE  IS A TAKE OVER CANDIDATE WILLINGLY OR UNWILLINGLY** unless there is some obscure Canadian rules that would prohibit it.  A company purchasing $PWE at today's valuation would be adding a relatively solid 4b in assets to their books.  

-

**Risks**

-

* Oil never recovers
* Oil goes down so does PWE, regardless of its value.
* [NYSE delisting in 120 days if they can't recover $1/share](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334388/000119312515313836/d69852dex991.htm).
* Electric cars -- everywhere
* Solar
* Fracking in the middle east.

I'm going to post this here because this was solid [WSB DD 9 months ago by a deleted user](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/2qh497/thoughts_on_pwe/cn7zesh).

-

&gt;Dividend down almost 80% to 3c/share with DRIP suspended; CAPEX is down 24%; production projected to be 5% lower. Penn West’s production has fallen every year since 2008. The most it achieved was an average of 189,426 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2008. 90,000 barrels per day is predicted for 2015. Penn West takes an average of 120 days to drill and complete a well compared with an average 40 days among its peers. They've had a difficult time disposing of assets to help pay off debt. The company found $381-million worth of questionable accounting entries in 2013 and 2012, causing it to obtained waivers from the holders of its senior unsecured notes to avoid default and restate earnings. The company is also accused of manipulating options and stock prices in addition to back dating of boardsitters' share sales and has had to sell assets at below market prices due to breaching bank covenants. Used to be a income trust, but converted to a stock company after the tax advantages of income trusts were erased by Canada's finance minister circa 2011.

-

**Professional Opinions**

-

The professionals disagree with /u/tedfor and I; The professionals are probably right.

* Columbine Capital Services Inc.: Sell (9/01/15)
* Merrill Lynch: Underperform (12/11/14)
* Trading Central: Sell (9/27/15)
* ValuEngine: Sell (10/01/15)
* Zachs: Hold (9/30/15)

-

**Price Warning** 

This stock has seen a recent rise in its stock price.   Note that almost a million shares were bought into a limit sell at .65.   With 502m shares outstanding this is a long game, there is no rocket to the moon, but maybe an escalator.  **If you're day trading you may be buying at the top of a temporary run-up to be followed by another dip back to pre-PR levels.**  If you're investing it doesn't really matter where you buy in at these levels.


-

**Conclusion**

-

Limited risk company.  Buy and forget about it for a year or two.   Unless oil becomes completely irrelevant, the stock should appreciate rather fantastically on a long term basis far out-pacing any stock index fund.

15-10-03,Where to buy long dated options,[deleted],1
15-10-03,Please give me feedback on my portofolio,"I started saving 2 years ago. I use TD Ameritrade. By my calculations I will be in the accumulation phase for about 10 more years. After which I plan to withdraw 4% to live off. I earn in an european currency so I have to buy US dollars every month. I keep my emergency cash stash in my local currency (about 2 full salaries).

This is my current asset allocation: 86% Stocks, 11% Bonds and 3% REITs.

Stocks:
- US Stocks - 70% - VTI
- International Stocks - 30% - Here I use VEU and VSS to mimic the VXUS index fund (90% VEU and 10% VSS)

Bonds:
- 100% in US Bonds - BND 

REITs:
- 100% in VNQ

Each year I plan to increase my Bonds allocation by 3%. So at my target retirement date - I will be at 50% Bonds (in about 13 years). And I also plan to increase the REITs to about 5%.

Should I also use international bonds and reits?

I plan to only use these ETFs, ""stay the course"" and don't alter the plan in any other way at least until retirement. I am also planning to diversify my investments by also buying a rental and starting a very small business in my town sometime in the futre, maybe in 5 years or so. The reason beeing that by my calculations the dollars I put to work early on are the most valuable so I decided to go all in on the stock market at the beginning.

Is this a sensible plan?

If you use $37 for the value of Hal (slightly above where it is now), times 1.12 you get $41.4. Add the $19, you get $60.4. $60.4 is the value, assuming things stay where they are, of each BHI share. Someone tell me if I'm not right, please.

If all of that is right, it means that people who have a cost basis in BHI of over $60.4 per share are going to be taking a ""loss"" if/when the merger occurs, right?

[obviously, if Hal increases or decreases between now and the date the price of Hal stock is set, the number changes.  Is the setting of the price/date something that would be in the merger paperwork? is this public information?]",1

I am looking for the most tax-efficient way to invest for retirement given my current situation. I am being paid through a government training fellowship and my income does not qualify as **earned income**. This disqualifies me from any sort of IRA (I was using a Roth IRA before I took this position) so I have simply been investing in a brokerage account through Vanguard. Unfortunately for me, this is not a short-term situation. I plan to start a PhD next year and the vast majority of programs pay stipends/fellowships that are not reported on a W-2 and are not **earned income**. So for me, this represents a 6+ year tax disadvantage. 

So my question is, are there other types of accounts for which I would be eligible that bear less of a tax burden? Any **LEGAL** tips and tricks for avoiding a full tax load in my situation? Any responses would be greatly appreciated!

15-10-04,What is a standard 401k employer contribution? What is considered good? What is poor?,"This June I began my career as an engineer. As someone interested in investing for retirement the best way I can, I've recently become curious about the different ways an employer determines to contribute to 401ks. I have a hard time finding specifics on contributions on company websites though. Maybe 1 in 10 companies actually discloses how they match. There's also Glassdoor, but the info there was inaccurate about my own company so I'm skeptical of others. If I really wanted to I could dig through 5500 forms but that isn't a very time-rewarding experience.

From what I can tell I've got a pretty good employer contribution, but some companies either don't disclose or they hide behind ambiguous statements such as profit sharing, company stock discounts, etc.. Or they offer a contribution up to a cash limit, in which case I have no idea how to compare directly. 

The simple version of my company's plan is that if I give 8% of my base salary, I get 10% of my base salary from them. But they have no profit sharing, discount company stock, longevity bonuses, or any other sort of scheme. They've got all the standard plans plus good index fund options supplied by Vanguard. I think my total expense ratio is on the order of 0.05%. There is a 5 year vesting schedule.

In my mind that is better than 4 out of 5 companies I've looked at, but I simply don't know if that is an accurate statement.

So that's why I'm asking the question. What is a good percentage of base pay to see an employer contribute? What is phenomenal? What is average? What is awful? Are there any companies that base contribution off of total pay rather than base pay?",70

I have looked through the =googlefinance function too (which i prefer) too but that contains no attributes to retrieve dividends.

Anyone know a data source with more complete information?",104

15-10-04,WGBS possible discount price?,"Edit: Still not a lot of movement in price. The launch of their new product (icell8) won't take place until sometime this week at the ASHG annual meeting and I wasn't able to find out which day that would take place. I'll report back if anything gets released to the press in the next few days.


I'll start by saying I'm still new - so absolutely take my opinion with the grain of salt. I'm here to simply ask some questions and provide a few facts that I noticed while examining this company. 

Pros that I've noticed 

* Increase in revenue from previous quarter
* Increase in EPS from previous quarter (although still negative)
* Cash and cash equivalents from 6 months ended June 30, 2015 almost double the cash and cash equivalents from 6 months ended June 30, 2014 
* Historically, they're 1 month from the lowest value that their stock has reached (even post-reverse split from a few years back)


Risks that I've noticed

* ROE% and ROA% are considerably lower than the previous quarter
* Product revenue has decreased since June 30, 2014 
* Negative CF from Ops

___________________________________________________

One of the biggest things that turned me onto the idea of investing in WGBS was this news here 

* ""WaferGen Bio-systems (Nasdaq: WGBS) announced that the Company will commence the commercial launch of the ICELL8™ Single-Cell System at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) Annual Meeting taking place October 6-8, 2015, in Baltimore, MD. The system will create a new standard for single-cell analysis, enabling unbiased isolation of up to 1,800 single cells on a single chip. The system includes an imaging station for rapid image capture and CellSelect™ software for automatic selection of cells of interest for further processing for RNA sequencing. The system also allows researchers to run multiple samples on a single chip, enabling applications that require investigation under uniform conditions.

“We are pleased that the ICELL8 Single-Cell System will now be available to deliver what the single-cell research community has requested: greater cell isolation capabilities, control over the selection of isolated cells and the ability to run multi-sample experiments,” said Rollie Carlson, CEO of WaferGen.

* I understand that investing in this company might be a considerable risk because they are still operating under a relatively heavy net loss. However, I was considering holding this for ~1 month, to see if their new technology that is being introduced this next week will increase their share price. 
* I also understand that the new technology could be a massive failure and not receive the anticipated reception from the industry. This would appear to be a sizable risk of an investment. 

What do the more seasoned investors on WSB think about this pick? Good, bad? I'd love to hear some more opinions -- I'm personally thinking about buying in on Monday and holding.

If a ticker sticks out to you and you're thinking about YOLO'ing some dollars at it, great!  If you'd like to get the rest of the retards on this board to give you their insight, no problem!  Here's the deal though- you need to put in some fucking effort. You can clean your room and do your chores later tonight, I'm sure your parents/bf/gf will understand that YOLO comes first.


This board is all about looking at spec plays, thinking outside the box and taking some b-hole puckering risk; but you better come correct. 


No more ""$ANUS Thoughts?"" posts. Tell us all WHY you are looking at it. Why you think it's a good play. Even if you're not some FA/TA stud, you can still give SOME reasoning as to why your tiny little pecker flinched when you saw it.

15-10-04,"Critique my portfolio? 23,Brokeragex2, IRA and 401k","[My portfolio has 15 holdings](http://hellomoney.co/portfolio/29d57b?ref=reddit-share): 5 stocks, 9 stock funds, 1 bond fund. It has a 96/2/2% allocation in stocks/bonds/other.

* My age: 23
* Income: 56-65k a year with OT and bonus. (looking like 65+ this year with the work schedules on projects) I am able to put away 500-1500 a month depending on OT and bonus will likely go mostly to investments. 
* Account type: First is brokerage in etrade and vanguard, second is IRA, third is 401k through work. 
* Debt: None
* Other savings or investments: 8k in savings and 1,500 in an ESOP. 
* Portfolio goal: Brokerage accounts are growth of money, still longish term investment but likely to be spent before retirement (house most likely). 

My thought process was as follows. Starting with the Etrade that i've had forever, aapl i've been holding since i bought it which was at about 90 pre split, 18 post split. Other investments have come and gone in that account but I would say it's my ""play"" money that i'll invest with. The vanguard brokerage, I went with VDIGX as compared to wellington or morgan growth or well just total stock market because I like the style of investment of the fund and feel it has the potential to consistently perform while supporting DRIP. 

401k and IRA i viewed as almost separate as they are funds I want to continue to invest in and well ideally hold until retirement. The company 401k was just switched to fidelity from milliman and they sorta screwed investments not target date. I looked at all the expense and performances and the blend will be the same as I have in hellomoney, but small mid and large are all coolumbia funds at .2 ratio's, the bond fund is the exact same, and the international went up to an expense of .6 but still developed markets. I feel light on bonds but feel ok with it, I've started to up the % going to in as compared to large. With the IRA I wanted to balance it out in a sense and hit areas I felt I might not have. Specifically REIT and emerging markets. I'm on track to be at the 5,500 by the end of the tax year. (putting more into it than my brokerage accounts now). VHT and VDC are sorta the random ones. I felt at the time that I just wanted exposure to healtcare specifically, and then VDC I feel is a ""safer"" bet. Current goal would be to continue 401k with a simple allocation large/mid/small/bond and intl and up the VWO and VNQ, not sure about the VDC/VHT.

I am youngish and while I may not be making or have as much in investments as other people my age I feel like I am in a good place with about 14k through these accounts+ the ESOP. I haven't quite figured out the IRA balancing really. What do you guys think? What should I look to get rid of IRA wise to balance it or switch funds too? Any critique on the brokerage accounts? ",30

15-10-05,Trading Advice,"After making some poor trading decisions last week, I decided to start making a trading journal for myself to avoid getting emotional when trading. To circumvent that, for each trade, I basically fill out the journal entry below. The date, and ticker lines are self explanatory. The 'reason' entry should be a short entry for why you are investing in this particular trade. The 'possible outcomes' entry should force you to think about the possible scenarios that you think could play out for your trade, so you avoid confirmation bias. 'Entry' is the price you paid for each unit of the security.


.


THE MOST IMPORTANT PART: Set a 'Loss exit target'. The biggest mistake I've made, and seen others make on here is not cutting losers quick enough. Yes you did your due diligence, yes you think the equity is going up (or down), but what if it doesn't go to plan? It's better to know ahead of time at what point you're willing to admit you're wrong and take a loss. Often people will say when their trade is in the red ""I'll sell when I break even"", and then they continue to see their equity lose value and their loss compounds. For this reason, it’s better to just set a percentage or dollar amount you’re willing to lose on the trade before you buy it. If it hits your loss target, sell. You can reevaluate if you want to get back in the trade at a later point, or if the original reason you bought it for went against you / wasn’t as important as you originally thought. 


.


The 'profit exit target' is a bit more tricky. An important adage to keep in mind here is ‘cut your losers quick, let your winners ride’. Often two things happen with winning trades: a) you sell too soon and see all the profit left on the table b) get greedy, and watch your winning trades become losers. One strategy to deal with this is scaling out of trades. By this I mean, let’s say you have 5000 shares of AVXL. When you see that AVXL has gained 10% in the morning, you may decide to sell 2500 of them for a nice profit. You then can watch what happens with the rest of your shares, and evaluate your next decision through the day instead. Another strategy is flat out set a profit target for a trade: for instance, let’s say you buy 1000 shares of some random Biotech tech from WSB. Set a stop limit sell order for maybe 10% or 20%.

15-10-05,Farmland REITs - Gold with a coupon?,"Would it be a good idea to add a farmland/agricultural REIT to a 3-fund lazy portfolio?

I am a 24 year old Australian, we have compulsory retirement (superannuation) savings that we cannot access until we are 60. My retirement fund is a 10/30/60 allocation of government bonds, Australian and total international stock indexes respectively.

However I'd like to keep a separate liquid portfolio that I can actually use before I'm 60. Because my superannuation fund is already aggressive, and I've never experienced a bear market, I was thinking about the following, slightly more conservative portfolio:

* 40% total international stock market
* 30% total Australian government bonds
* 20% total Australian stock market
* 10% Australian REIT (farmland)

There is only one farmland REIT in Australia - Rural Funds Group - which has poultry farms, almond orchards and vineyards. I haven't done the required research about it yet, but I thought it might be a nice way to diversify in a relatively uncorrelated asset.

Would I be better off following this through or should I just stick to stocks and bonds?",17

Currently, Facebook has a higher market capitalization than EVERY US COMPANY EXCEPT THESE 5: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Berkshire and Exxon. Its current valuation is normally reserved for blue-chip companies that are consistently earning 11-digit profits every year.

Facebook earnings growth trajectory is similar to that of Google in 2005 and 2006:
Facebook 2014 $1.5B 2015 $2.94B
Google 2005 $1.47B 2006 $3.08B
Google's market cap was ~$110B in Q1 2007, less than half of Facebook's with on comparable earnings.

With the recent stock market weakness, momentum darlings have been dropping like flies. Netflix and Apple are now down 20% from highs after years of parabolic growth.

It's hard to call a top but can be very profitable if the trade is timed correctly. I think Facebook will see a &lt;= $150B MC before it reaches $400B.

15-10-05,"Playing $AVXL &amp; $SGNL","Good morning and happy Monday.

I am just offering my thoughts on playing these 2 stocks in the short term.  I think that after November comes around $AVXL will be set at a higher level, so longs can ignore this post.

**Interim $AVXL** - The stock still looks very strong.  The action has been a little tight on bid/ask delta for quite a while.  The RSI is a little warm.  I think there will be some chances to scalp before Nov comes along.  I would not be surprised if the first of these chances doesn't come along this week.  $1.44 will probably be the floor, if it touches $1.30 I will give it everything I have.  

What do other traders think about swings on the way up for AVXL?

**SGNL** -    This stock plummeted on low volume after a news run.  It bounced a little on Friday, but with low volume still.  This is a high volatility patience stock.

I would suggest watching the price action and setting multiple alerts if you are playing this one.  Very little trading activity can have big surge and dip potential.

This is a high risk bet in the first place, but I would say that the following are the exit points that correspond to where the stock will meet with some resistance. 

$1.00 - $1.25 - lower high risk

$1.25-1.35 - medium high risk

$1.35 - $150 high high risk

$1.50+ don't expect this without a massive volume run (which might happen on news or from a trading group manipulating), set alerts for +50% and +150% and +250% of avg trading volume to recognize a possible surge. 

I hope that this post is welcome.  I don't often see posts on how to actually play and realize gains after the initial DD and ""pump"" posts.  Community thoughts?",19

15-10-05,New investor looking for advice on NRP/general advice,"Hello fellow YOLOers,

I just started a full time job out of school at the end of July where basically all of my non expense money is going into the market.  I am wondering what your thoughts are on a commodity company like Natural Resource Partners(sorry in advance if this is going to piss off the personal DD poster lol).  They are at a 52 week range of 2.21-13.83 and sitting @2.44 now.  They also give a solid 15% dividend (but i couldnt care less about dividends until i have significant investment capital from yoloing, or none at all as it may be).  Their financials look pretty solid to me, but I was a CS major not business so I'm slowly picking everything up.  I guess my question is, crude oil is one of their markets, but they also range in commodities like natural gas and coal -- are these markets somewhat directly correlated?  If oil doesnt shoot up anytime soon can the company still experience an upturn in the future through its other assets?  

Besides this, I have a few general questions: Should I close out my position in Fannie Mae atm and invest in other more promsing short term stocks?  From what I've gathered on the many lawsuits, I can't tell when decisions are supposed to be made, or if the market will shoot the price up beforehand.  I definitely want to take a gamble on it, but not sure if I could grow my capital elsewhere in the meantime.

In regards to daytrading, do I have to do companies that have significant monetary value to be able to do it and beat commission fees?  For instance if I put almost 1k in a company that goes from .0009-.0013 in a day with a volume of 27 million, chances are I won't be able to move that entire amount for what I want right?  I know I could use robinhood, but not worth having to wait the settlement + 3 if im making 20 dollars instead of 200 because of the amount of shares I can move.

Lastly, are there any decent sites you swear by to get speculative news/info? I understand yoloing usually means betting against analyst opinions but worth an ask.

Thanks.

Corrections Corp of America - Hold - $37  
The Geo Group - Buy - $43  

**Industry Overview**
**Behind the Bars: Bi-Weekly Prison Update 10-5-15**  

The Behind the Bars Prison Update is a bi-weekly report providing an update on current trends and relevant recent news on the private prison sector. We believe the private prison sector offers a unique blend of very defensive fundamentals with significant and accretive external growth potential. Investors have been growing increasingly worried about the impact of immigration and sentencing reform on operating performance. However, it is our view that while headline risk is a concern from a stock performance perspective, these are unwarranted concerns from an operating perspective. Additionally, GEO and CXW trade at wide discounts to the broader REIT sector. As such, we believe both stocks are poised to perform well. However, we prefer GEO's higher dividend yield (8.3% vs. CXW's 7.4%) and diversified business model.  

Proposition 47 Update (Page 2): In 3Q, GEO saw an increase of 32 prisoners to 2,207 prisoners (+1.5%) in California. Over the same time frame, CXW saw total CA populations fall by 15%, which includes out-of-state population decreases of 1,326 prisoners to
6,123 (-18%). This compares with the expectation that California out-of-state populations will stabilize around 5,000 prisoners. Given several weeks of volatility, including weeks when the number of prisoners actually moves higher, we believe the effects of Prop 47 are less disruptive than initially expected. Furthermore, CXW management reiterated on the 2Q earnings call initial out-of-state decreases observed to-date were in-line to slightly better than originally expected.  

Top news this week (further details on page 3):
• Sentencing overhaul proposed in Senate with bipartisan backing (10/1). Bipartisan agreement has been reached on reducing mandatory sentencing for non-violent crimes, but a formal bill is still a ways off. Potential impacts to GEO and CXW would be neutral to slightly negative given prisoner demographics but lower overall US prisoner count.  
• The GEO Group signs contract for the continued management of Northwest Detention Center (9/10). 1,575 beds at a company-owned and managed facility were renewed at similar economics but termed out from 5 years to 9.5 years.  
• Minnesota's prison overcrowding raises a dreaded name: CCA (9/30). Minnesota's prison capacity will force their hand into either spending $141M to build a new facility or reopen an idle CXW facility. We believe the reactivation of CXW's facility is the logical
solution.  

Recent stock performance (Page 6): Over the past two weeks, GEO's stock was down 4.7%, while CXW was down 7.9%. Over the same period, the RMZ was up 0.9%. In September, GEO was down 1.0%, while CXW was up 0.5%. This compares to the RMZ
which was up 2.4% over the same time frame.  

Valuation (Page 6): Both GEO and CXW have traded at a discount to the REIT sector since inception, averaging a 3.9x discount for CXW and a 3.7x discount for GEO. Currently, both companies are trading even wider than the historical averages, with CXW trading at a 5.6x discount while GEO trades at a 6.6x discount.",0

15-10-06,Roth IRA - 100% Stocks w/ Small Money?,"Hello,

I just turned 27 and my Roth IRA only consists of $6,000 at the moment (but I also have other investment vehicles, a 401(k), ESPP, restricted stock, individual account, etc.).  My 401(k)'s composition consists of 65% domestic/25% international/10% bonds.

Currently, my Roth IRA consists of FDEEX funds, with an expense ratio of 0.75% &lt;!!!&gt;.

Would it be a better idea to sell all of my FDEEX funds, and buy all VTI, or all FSTMX within the Roth IRA given the little amount that I have in there?  My 401(k) is exposed to bonds already, and I have another 33 years until I retire.  I really appreciate the advice I have already received in my other threads.

Thank you for your time.",1
15-10-05,"At work, no one wants to talk about the 401(k). Here on reddit, everyone talks about it.","Like many others, I didn’t pay much attention to what kinds of fees shaved off my retirement savings. I’m a 33-year-old and had multiple 401(k) accounts from previous jobs. I made a habit of setting aside money from my paychecks to fund it without knowing what I’ve funded. This is what my previous 401(k)s looked like: http://hellomoney.co/portfolio/4e306d

I’ve been pretty bad about reading documentation on my plan and did not take these retirement plans seriously. So I’ve been accumulating financial literacy debt. But now I understand whether you’re aware of not, the expenses cut into the future nest egg. Finally I rolled over three 401k into my rollover IRA with significantly lower fees. http://hellomoney.co/portfolio/310358-current-ira-investments


But I don’t think any of my colleagues do this. This 401(k) system was supposed to be written for people, even those who don’t know anything about finance. But I feel like the system is not made for consumer. At my workplace, no one talks about the 401(k) because trying to figure out how to take control of the plans can be overwhelming, especially for someone who doesn't have the time or knowledge. I should be able to chat about this at work, but instead I have to come here to reddit. How can this culture of silence change?

15-10-06,Stock Analysis: Oshkosh Corp - OSK,"**Intro**

OSK: A Producer Manufacturing Company that markets a broad range of specialty vehicles and vehicle bodies.  Focusing mostly on Access Equipment, Defense, Fire and Emergency, and Commercial.  They have been around since 1917.

**Growth Potential**

Currently sitting at $39.03 a share after going up 2.4% Monday, I believe this stock has some true potential and I'll tell you why.  With a current P/E ratio of 12.3 its still a bargain to grab, in addition to it being highly valued with the highest PEG value in the Machinery industry with 14.58x (Average is 10.87x). Which shows you the potential of the company's expected growth rate.  The stock is currently sitting near it's lowest point at the moment in the past two years, so the potential to come back doesn't seem impossible as its been there already and its current uproar.  In addition, their earnings grew in the past year despite facing decreased revenues, they also performed better than the average company in the Machinery Industry in that aspect.  The company's operating profits are also 10.67x greater than their interest payments.  So that means they shouldn't have any real issues with handling their debt. 

**Dividend!**

Whats special about OSK is that they actually provide an annual dividend.  It's currently $0.68, which yields at **1.86%**, I find this important to mention not only because it's a pretty good yield, but because in the Machinery Industry its actually pretty rare to find stocks that pay dividends.  

**Recent News**

This August, the Oshkosh Corp won a contract from the U.S. Army awarding them **$6.7Billion** to manufacture 17,000 new vehicles to replace old Humvees. If things go right for OSK, the amount on the contract could explode to a whopping **$30Billion** depending if they continue to contract them to manufacture whole 55,000 vehicles that's planned to be manufactured for the Army.

TheStreet also just posted an article on OSK labeling them as a ""Barbarian at the Gate"".  With even more potential listed on the site.  Here's the link below for that information, but I ain't paying them money to see the whole article.

http://www.thestreet.com/story/13312316/1/oshkosh-osk-marked-as-a-barbarian-at-the-gate.html?puc=CNNMONEY&amp;cm_ven=CNNMONEY

I bought in all of them super low on 8/24, and sold everything but SBUX last week because I let the panic get to me on those few down days.

I still made a pretty decent 15-20% profit on anything, but now I'm kind of wishing I held on to ATVI and NVDA as they're at or near their 52 week highs and seem to have even more growth potential.

Do you guys bite the bullet in similar positions, and jump back in at the higher price?  Or do you live and learn, and look for other value buys that will hopefully grow.

* This is my starting position. I am ready to get up to 50 (in rare scenarios) should the price of the call fall to $4-5. I do not anticipate buying more than 35 however ($5 at a time from now on).

* This will be my final trade as I officially retire from trading to enjoy other activities in life.

* Apple is so undervalued right now it might crash the computer our universe is being generated on. I still can't believe Apple is trading at a P/E of 8 post-cash... When you remove the buyback, Apple is trading back at what it was trading for last December!

* **This is purely a play on the awesome 6+ and 6S+ that 99% of people completely underestimate.**

Paul Tudor Jones, the founder of Tudor Investment Corp., said he expects markets to be choppier as the Federal Reserve for the first time in decades focuses on managing debt, rather than steering local economic developments.

While the Fed in the past would have reacted to signs of a slowdown by easing, the central bank is realizing that there’s a “tail risk” tied to having interest rates near zero, Jones said in a television interview Monday on ""Bloomberg &lt;GO&gt;"" with David Westin and Stephanie Ruhle.

“Now I think for the first time since Volcker probably you see the Fed managing for the balance sheet, to take out the tail risk associated with expanding debt virtually globally, and not to mention our federal debt,” Jones said. That “points to a choppier market.”

Marc Lasry, the billionaire co-founder of Avenue Capital Group, said on the same program that the Fed needs to raise rates sooner rather than later. The U.S. economy is ""doing great"" compared with the rest of the world and doesn’t need more stimulus from the central bank, he said.

""Having more stimulus isn’t what we need,"" Lasry said. ""You need to get back to a little more normality.""

Lasry said the U.S. is the best place to invest in equities, while he sees distressed opportunities in Europe and Asia. After oil prices have plunged, the hedge fund manager said, energy has become a phenomenal opportunity and he has bought a ""bunch"" of energy names.

Bill Gross, who runs the $1.4 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, said zero-percent interest rates are hurting savers and the Fed needs to raise them to restore a more balanced economy.

""I think you need higher interest rates,"" Gross said in an interview today on
Bloomberg Radio. ""Capitalism will not thrive at zero percent.""

Gross used to run the world’s biggest mutual fund at Pacific Investment

Is this interpretation correct? If yes, why would someone bet big money on the demise of such a ""safe"" company? If I misunderstand this, then what does it mean?

15-10-06,"401(K) Company stopped offering fund, Fidelity exchanged into new fund, realizing $5K Loss","My employer recently made a change to the funds that employees are allowed to contribute to in the 401K program managed by fidelity.

They sent notification of the change, advising that on a specific date, any shares not already exchanged to other funds would automatically be moved from Fund A to Fund B

I did not receive this notification. As a result, the date came, my investments were exchanged and I inadvertently realized a $5K loss. In essence, this trade was made without my authorization.

I left the company at the same time that they sent notification to employees, contributing, I think to the communication miss. Had I received it, I would have done my best to time the market and given the performance data on the fund, there are several days in the period leading up to the exchange in which I could have profited or at least avoided a loss as a result of the exchange.

Spoke to Fidelity, no joy so far. Do I have any recourse?

15-10-06,Thoughts on $RJET,"Hello Everyone, 

Welcome to my latest fuck up. Well, I have yet to see if it's a fuck up, but read on and we'll decide together. 

Eager to jump onto the profit banwagon I bought 5,000 shares in $RJET somewhere in the $6.30-6.35 range. It peaked out at about $6.45 yesterday but I was too incompetent to take my few bucks of profit and run. 

Today, we're seeing the prices billow around $6.27. I'm no expert market analysis by any stretch of the imagination (actually, I am) but following the ABCXYZ diagram, I'm thinking that it might pop up again. Maybe peaking out at around $6.70 this time. 

What are your thoughts? Look at the graph real quick, again, the ticker is $RJET and let me know, is it going to shit be bed like my latest failure $VRNG or will I have enough money to buy a golden condom for my yacht?

Two questions that I'm debating right now:

-Should I close out VTSAX and move remaining funds into VFFVX, never-minding the lower expense ratio and (likely) higher dividends, in order to reduce my risk level to the suggested target and have the 2055 just go to work re-allocating its assets to a more Conservative position over time?

-Should I continue to make contributions into VTSAX, and if so, what percentage of contributions should go in there?

15-10-07,"Contract to Deed for Grandmother's House?","Hello all, I came across an interesting scenario today while talking with my dad and I was looking for some investor(s) opinions related to the potential scenario.

I'm 24, close to paying most debt, with a modest 60k income. Recently, my grandmother entered an assisted living facility for good and will likely never return to her home for the remainder of her life. This leaves the house there for the indefinite future generating no income, but still requiring property tax/home insurance/utilities to be paid. We were considering gutting the property of valuables, having an estate sale, and then selling the house, but then I had an idea:

About the house:

* The house has a market value of about 70k.

* Eastern suburb of St. Louis (15 min out of downtown).

* Rental value of similar 2Br/2Ba houses in the neighborhood ~900-1000/mo.

* The house is fully furnished with lightly used furniture and mostly modern appliances (&lt;20 years old).

* Almost brand new 2 car garage.

So my idea was to contract-to-deed the house from my grandmother and remove all items that aren't worth anything or have sentimental value to the family, then rent the rest of the property (furnished) as a short term corporate rental. Similar furnished offerings in the area range from 1200 at the extended stay to 2500 a month at higher end condos. 

I would be looking to pay her around 400 a month for the house while assuming all bills/responsibilities. If I rented the property to corporate clients as such, for say $1500/mo. About $200/mo would go to all covered utilities and insurance, while another $150-$200 would go to the next door neighbor (who is a life long friend of my grandmother's) to maintain the property and answer service calls. This would leave 700+ in excess money per month that I could bank just in case the house goes to crap and needs repairs. 

What do you seasoned investors think? Is it too much extra hassle for the money or would you see this as a decent long term investment?",3

15-10-06,I need some help deciding on allocation of my 401k that is with Prudential. So few choices and so high ER in many of the funds.,"Good afternoon all,  

  
I've already posted to personalfinance and just wanted a second opinion from investing.
I've recently started a job and have become full salaried. I'm 24 years old (about to turn 25) and make roughly 70k before taxes. I already have 6 months worth of living expenses as an emergency fund.  The company offers a 4% match on any 401k contributions and I thought I'd take advantaged of it by contributing 4% of my income for now. The problem is that the 401k is with Prudential and Prudential hasn't been known to offer the standards of funds you see with Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. I do not have a Roth IRA yet but that will be the next order of business once I establish this 401k. The funds available to me, however, do not seem to be as bad as some of the other ones I have seen (also with Prudential and charging higher ER for the same funds) on this subreddit. Here is the complete list of funds available to me: http://imgur.com/L18dPGY

By default, if I do not make a choice, they will enroll in 45 days from now and my allocation will be set to the default GoalMaker Allocation. I don't particularly like this one as (for my number of years to retire category) it will put me in quite a few funds that have 1% + Expense ratio.

The default GoalMaker Allocation:  
Guaranteed Income Fund 14%, ER .1%  
PIMCO Total Return Admin 16%, ER .71%  
Alger Capital Appreciation Instl I 15%, ER 1.19%  
Columbia Dividend Income Z 15%, ER .83%  
Mid Cap Growth/Artisan Partners Fund 4%, ER 1.02%  
Small Cap Growth/TimeSquare Fund 4%, ER 1.00%  
American Century Mid Cap Value Inv 4%, ER 1.01%  
Goldman Sachs Small Cap Value Instl 4%, ER .96%  
American Funds EuroPacific Gr R5 24%, ER 0.55%  

As I have said before, there's a decent bit of fixed income in this allocation (roughly 30%) and a good few funds with expense ratio over 1%. I am pretty young and want to be on the aggressive side and from reading the sidebar and numerous threads in this subreddit, high expense ratio is a no no.   


&gt;**A low expense ratio is the single best indicator of superior long-term performance.**
&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k  


I took a little test on the Prudential website and it said that base on my answers I should allocate:    
-Large Cap Stock Value 19%  
-International 36%  
-Large Cap Int 19%  
-Small/Mid Cap Stock - Value 13%  
-Small/Mid Cap Stock - Growth 13%  
It doesn't seem horrible; however, most of the funds that are available to me that fit those categories have some ridiculous ER.

The best fund that I've fund has a very low ER. Not Vanguard low but still decently low  
-Dryden S&amp;P 500 Index Fund ER 0.17%

There are also two international equity funds with decently low ER. Roughly 3x the S&amp;P Index, which is standard.  
-American Funds Europacific Growth R5, ER 0.53%(this one seems to perform better over 10 year average)    
-T. Rowe Price International Eq, ER 0.50%

&gt;Generally speaking, cheap international funds tend to have ERs about 3x higher than domestic funds and small-cap and bond funds tend to be about 1.5-2x higher in ER than large-cap stock funds. Expensive funds tend to have an ER around 0.75% to 1.5% regardless of the type.  
&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k_funds

After reading some of the threads from a few people in the same situation as myself, numerous commentators have recommended that they just put 100% into the S&amp;P 500 Index Fund and diversify their Vanguard Roth IRA with some Small cap, Mid cap, and/or international funds. Or maybe put 80% into the S&amp;P 500 Index and 20% into the International one. Right now I'm fairly set on putting 100% into the S&amp;P 500 Index Fund since the ER for everything else is so high and I can diversify elsewhere. I know not having any bonds may reduce the hedging ability in a downturn and also reduce the portfolio's ability to buy more equity in the event of a downtown, but since I won't be touching this for a very, very, very long time, I really don't see the harm in going full yolo and putting 100% in equity.  
&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/26xemq/any_advice_on_my_prudential_goalmaker_401k/chve6a8  
&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1d3hz5/help_me_choose_a_fund_for_my_401k_plus_why_do/

I also have a few general questions.  
1, The ""Average Annual Total Return as of"" percentage. Is this before or after Expense Ratio is deducted?  

2, Why should I not invest in one of those funds that have a high expense ratio (Mid Cap Growth / Artisan Partners, T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock, Alger Capital Appreciation Instl I, etc) but also higher 10 year average annual total return (as oppose to S&amp;P 500 Index Fund, which has a 7.78% 10 year average)? I know the subreddit guidelines say that it's better to invest in low ER, low management index funds but isn't a better higher 10 year track record a decent indication of better future performance than a index fund(obviously, past performance does not guarantee future performance but isn't it a decent indicator?).  

It would be very interesting to hear the various opinions of redditors among investing to see the various perspectives. Thank you all for the help in advance.

15-10-06,"Stocks, Foreign Exchange...without fees, margins...?","Hey guys
i have question that is chasing me everywhere and i cant find way out.
I have been buying stock and trying to gain money on Forex sicne some time. I used e.g. eToro, Plus500..
But the downside of all these earning money is leverages and fees.
For example, Forex:
1. You buy usd/eur but leverage is attached to you by Forex broker. So if lets say pair goes down 50 pips you will margin call and your account is closed.
2. You buy stock on Plus500. Each day you have to pay premium fee for holding this stock.
Question:
How can i just buy online currency without any leverages and margin calls. I just want to buy online lets say USD on the money i have my own, like i buy it in brick-and-mortar banks. And sit with it. I dont care that 50 pips will go down and i am out.
The same with stocks. I want to buy stocks on my money i have. ANd not to care abot daily fees.
p.s. i am out of USA territory

Thanks for your attention",3

**DISCLOSURE PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS** I have been in AVXL since the .70s.   I have made [obscene amounts of money](https://i.imgur.com/0LIFPEP.png) on this stock and expect to make even more obscene amounts.   **I AM NOT AN IMPARTIAL PARTY TO THIS STOCK**.   I am going to try and be objective and I am going to try and outlay all of the risks, but my position in this stock may blind me to some of the negatives **and especially price projections!**  Do your own DD and be extraordinarily critical of this one.   Please.

-

**INTRO**

-

Anavex has been a WSB regular for quite a while.  Even if you don’t know what it does, you probably know it makes people some money now and again because we keep talking about it.  Unlike **MOST** WSB stocks (looking at you here BGMD and AMDA), this one actually doesn’t have many bag holders, at least not for long.  It’s been the target of at LEAST **THREE** pump and dumps with the latest dump starting the very day of this DD article.  Most stocks couldn’t survive one pump and dump, but AVXL has thrived.  So what’s the deal?   What is going on here?  And how in the hell did /r/wallstreetbets manage to pick a stock that actually has people buying the dips and selling the peaks?  Because that is totally not how things normally go here.

-

**THE COMPANY**

-

Anavavex life sciences started as a small photo processing company that quickly died and its incorporation was sold to some investors that used it to create its new biotech incarnation and they purchased the rights to a drug from a greek researcher to be their product.   This drug showed promise in addressing protein mis-folding (an identified cause of [Alzheimers, Depression, Epilepsy, Parkinson’s, and ALS](http://www.anavex.com/about-us/target-indications/) ) After a few years of meandering and mismanagement a new CEO was brought in.  Christopher Missling is a German doctor and he quickly managed to secure financing and more importantly arrange for an expedited clinical trial process for Anavex’s drug candidates.

-

I want to talk a little more about Dr. Missling because he not only turned the company around but he *communicates* with the shareholders and he is an activist in preserving shareholder value.  So a CEO can’t come right out and say hey our clinical trials are doing FANTASTIC but he can certainly move a conference from September to July.   And he can certainly create [automatic purchases right up to the very edge of that conference](http://finance.yahoo.com/marketpulse/AVXL)    He can offset a necessary warrant conversion by following it up with a [patent announcement](http://www.anavex.com/?news=anavex-receives-notice-of-allowance-for-u-s-patent-application-related-to-anavex-2-73) that they probably had for a month or so, and a notice that the [Michael J Fox Foundation is funding one of your trials](http://www.anavex.com/?news=anavex-awarded-grant-from-the-michael-j-fox-foundation-for-parkinsons-research).

-

So now we’re coming up on our next set of data and Dr. Missling is a bit more constrained in what he can communicate since he can’t buy shares without interfering with a buy out, merger, and maybe a partnership.   So this time we get a dreaded reverse split to list on NASDAQ and guess what — AVXL will be fully NASDAQ when that conference data is presented.  And why would we rush NASDAQ if the conference data was not good?   In his back-channel communication Dr. Missling is telling the faithful, “we’re all good here, NASDAQ is going to make the stock go up quite a bit more on the conference data the we would OTC”.   That’s my reading.   Feel free to make your own decision.

-

The point of all this back story on the CEO is that most company’s we invest in we [gripe and complain and grouse about management](http://finance.yahoo.com/mb/BGMD/).  AVXL is different.  That’s important.  It’s actually VERY important.  Dr. Missling didn’t have to buy those 1k lots, he already had millions and more in options, but he bought them to communicate with us and he’s still communicating.

**FINANCIALS**

-
As of [June 30](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1314052/000106299315004580/form10q.htm), AVXL had 7.9m in cash and 1.4m in liabilities but [in their sept 15 filing](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1314052/000106299315005193/exhibit99-1.htm) they show $15m cash on hand and 1m in liabilities.  So since Sept 15 they’ve converted some warrants and we’re seeing that MJFF grant show up on the books. They burn around 500k a month but have some expenses in the summer that can push that burn to 1.4m. There are ***66,204,173 warrants** as of the last ER, all of them in the money (.75 or below)  and some have already been converted.   AVXL has an agreement with Lincoln Park to require them to purchase *UP TO* $10,000,000 in shares at whatever the current closing price is (as long as the current price is over .50) and to date AVXL has availed itself of $1.3m of that, minting  about 1.75m new shares added to the float.

So what does all of that tell us?   Well the POTENTIAL float of AVXL is 149m shares (or 37m after the RS) if every warrant is converted (Discounting Lincoln sales which there’s no way to calculate).  AVXL is about to become a medium float stock, it’s going to move faster on good news and fall harder on bad than it’s previous bloated status.

-

The expenses without income tell us that next year AVXL is probably going to dilute some.  But thanks to that Lincoln Park agreement they’ll probably do it in a way that won’t show up until the next ER (which nobody be me reads apparently).   The reverse split nd NASDAQ inflation after the conferences and final data presentation will also mean AVXL will have to issue fewer shares to get their money.  So sometime during this year’s catalysts at the very height of the stock they may go to Lincoln Park and say “We’d like our $8m please, here’s 50 shares — Ha!  If only).   The January ER will show the float increased a million shares or so and their cash on hand increased $8m or so.  And nobody will really notice.

-

The thing is, Lincoln Park financing aside, AVXL is not in a position to need to look for toxic financing or warrant offerings.  They are in a position to look for a partner to defray development costs of their drug pipeline.  They can also sell or license their drug to other companies to explore its use in its other indictions.   And yes, they can raise money by issuing more stock but if the price is high enough that would not impact its holders as severely as if it was still a .50c penny stock.  I’m sugar coating dilution here and I realize it so yes, its going to happen, yes it will be bad, no I don’t know how bad, but I expect some fund raising this year through Lincoln Park (with no real impact) and then maybe sometime near the middle of next year for more operational funds.  Again, unless they license or sell and indication, get a good partner deal, or get a few more grants.

-

**NASDAQ/Reverse Split NOTE**

-

By the time you read this $AVXL will be in the process of doing a reverse 4:1 stock split which means if you owned 400 shares of AVXL at $1.00/share you will now own 100 shares of AVXL at $4.00 share.   This is necessary for the uplift to NASDAQ.  Reverse splits are generally bad.  Getting uplifted to NASDAQ is generally more good than a reverse split is bad.   NASDAQ will allow AVXL to be purchased on margin, will allow people to purchase AVXL without impacting their margins in other stocks (much), allows easier institutional investing any institutions and eventually put and call options.

-

For the next 20 days AVXL will trade under the ticker symbol **AVXLD**, after 20 days when AVXL becomes officially a NASDAQ stock it will again trade under the symbol AVXL.

-

My personal view is NASDAQ is a very, very good thing for AVXL even if some may view the reverse split as a negative.

-

**Catalysts**

* Data presentation in Barcelona Spain November 7 for more patients in the p2a trial.  We pretty much know the data is going to be good.  So expect a run up to this ($8 a share trading range at the very least on the close of November 6).  Whether you want to hold through the conference presentation is your call.   If the data is good expect the stock to start moving into the $12-$25 range toward the end of the year.   Note that $25 would value the company at roughly a billion dollars, for a p2a company that may be time to be looking to hedge or divest.  But on a moderate float in the rush of final p2a data it may touch that number.

* Final P2A presentation at the end of the year.   The [p2a trial is fully enrolled](http://www.anavex.com/?news=anavex-completes-patient-enrollment-for-phase-2a-alzheimers-trial-ahead-of-schedule) and we can expect final data before the end of the year and in q1 of January at the very latest.

* Possible announcement of phase 1 clinical trials for Parkinson’s which was funded back in August by the Michael J Fox foundation.

* NASDAQ uplift — institutional funding can move in (on the smaller float!), people can buy AVXL without impacting their margin, people can buy AVXL ON margin, international traders can buy AVXL.  **ROBINHOOD USERS CAN BUY $AVXL — holy crap!**

* REMOTE — Partnership agreement before the end of the year.

* REMOTE -- license of indication to another drug company.

* REMOTE - selling an indication to another drug company.

* REMOTE - purchase of ANAVEX (No insider trades since July, but no reason to go through NASDAQ expense if they were in talks.).

**Risks**

* Warrant Dilution — thanks to /u/Simon_Inaki for pointing this out to me.   Those 66m warrants (some of which have already been converted to shares) are **all** in the money and they will be joining the stock pool.   We should end up eventually with a 37-40m (after split) share pool but that’s 40% more hands claiming the pie so your overall value as you hold this stock will go down either actually down in price or expressed as slower growth.  **THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL IMMEDIATE AND LONG TERM RISK**  (Note this may be somewhat offset by new institutional holding available on NASDAQ)

* **ADDITIONAL WARRANT RISKS** (Again thanks to /u/Simon_Inaki) The devil is in the details and the financing companies that buy warrants are the devil and the retail shareholder’s enemy.   There may be clauses and covenants in these warrants that trip on reverse spits, and other factors that are **extremely unfavorable to shareholders**.   I intend to write up another DD on AVXL’s warrants this week but be aware that these risks are presently **unknown**.

* Operational Dilution.  There will be dilution to keep the company running and fund trials and new trials until revenues come in.  Invisible dilution in december that nobody should really notice.  Probably some about the middle of next year unless they can secure partnership or licensing agreements.  The dilution will be less harsh and severe than it would have been if AVXL was still a penny stock trading under a buck.

* The data starts turning sour.   If their measurable success rates start getting questioned or fall below 75% improvement, look to hedge.  If people start dying, look to exit :)

* [Patent Issues](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB4QFjAAahUKEwjR6abJlq_IAhUEjA0KHYJnBGg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Farticle%2F3354415-interview-with-dr-christopher-missling-ceo-of-anavex&amp;usg=AFQjCNEfGBzndIq5mjvyXKe_4dy6lLdfaA) Note that Anavex has a board member who specifically specializes in patent issues.  However the inventor of Anavex’s drug has not formally signed over the rights to the drug to my knowledge.  However Anavex has publicly stated they do not see this as an issue, it is not a concern and the US has already issued and assigned the patent to them.  But be aware of this risk.

* Promissory notes issue with the previous CEO and board that AVXL considers illegal and intends to dispute and fight.

* Biotech (LABD).  The sector goes down so will AVXL.  On OTC AVXL was rather insulated from market trends — it had its own weather so to speak.

* AVXL has been the target of three pump and dumps (none of which change the underlying fundamentals of the stock).  I believe the risk of a pump and dump after the reverse split on NASDAQ will be substantially reduced but do be aware that it remains a possibility.

* Note that in the past under the old board and CEO AVXL used stock promotion services.   To my knowledge it has not engaged in this under the new management and nothing shows up in their 10q’s to indicate that the company has engaged in this practice under the new management.

* it’s going to have its own [StockTwits](http://stocktwits.com/symbol/avxl) board in a few days and if you invest you ARE going to be visiting it — quit kidding yourself.

15-10-07,"Is it worth investing in stocks when you're making under 1,500 a month?","I'm a 20 year old who's currently attending college. I have an arrangement with my parent's in which I pitch in for part of the rent and help maintain the house due to my mother's disability as well as her raising my little brother with big medical needs. In turn they don't have any problem with me living there until I get a job out of college allowing me to be entirely independent.

As it stands my monthly bills are floating around 350 dollars a month after food, gas, etc.

This means I have a little over 1,000 a month that will be put into a savings account which will garnish minimal interest that will probably go unnoticed.

Right now I feel like I'm waiting on the final pay tier for my job (under Kroger) before I really feel like I'm making any money. I've been debating potentially investing in the stock market while I put some of that money into savings, but I don't feel like the amount of money I'm making will give me any big boost in the stock market as the money I will be capable of putting into it will be enough to give me any leverage.

My father was heavily invested into the stock market when he was my age and did quite well until he gave it up, so I have a reliable source and someone who can guide me through the steps.

So let's say I put 500 a month into savings and drop the rest into stocks. Does this sound like a viable idea? Or should I just follow in the footsteps of my other peers and save, then invest once I get a higher paying job?

Kroger does not have a stock buy in plan like Walmart does (pay 50% and they match the other 50%) but they do have a weekly plan.
Copied directly from the employee handbook:
""This plan lets you share in Kroger’s success. You can contribute as little as $3 a week post-tax to buy Kroger stock. You don’t pay commissions or fees, and you can sell your stock at any time.""

This is also one option I have if I want to get in the stock market through Kroger, which is in a decline atm so stocks are low, but it being Kroger, this will change in time. ",15

15-10-07,Apple’s real cash pile is 99% smaller than you think,"You’re one of millions of loyal **Apple** stockholders. And if there’s anything you love more than your new iPhone 6s, it’s the huge **$203 billion** in spare cash that the company says is sitting in its bank accounts.

It’s the number that appears on Page 8 of the company’s most recent quarterly financial report.

It’s a record cash pile for any American company. It’s a **$50 billion** increase in the past 12 months alone.

And it’s equal to **$36 per share**, a juicy amount for shares you can buy for around $110.

There’s just one problem: That spare cash is mostly **an illusion**, even a shell game, as a new report has just confirmed. In reality, the amount of spare cash that Apple has on its balance sheet is a tiny fraction of that.

Actually, it’s about the same as the estimated net worth of its CEO, Tim Cook.

We’ll get updated numbers when the company reports its fourth-quarter results **Oct. 27**.

But as of June 30, Apple had **$239 billion in liquid assets** — including that $203 billion in cash, inventories, accounts receivables and so on — and owed **$179 billion in liabilities**, including everything “on” and “off” the balance sheet.

And then it would have to pay **$59.2 billion in U.S. taxes** if it tried to return the cash to investors.

Put it all together, and the amount left over is just **$800 million**.

That’s not **$36 per share**.

It’s **14 cents**.

15-10-07,Why I put my last paycheck into $VLKAY,"Ok guys, this is not the riskiest play on the board, but I moved my last paycheck into a tax exempt account for some free yolo. Here is my reasoning:

-Volkswagen has recently taken a shit kicking that is most undeserved, lets move back to the pre-scandal stock price for a valuation

-Before the scandal, the stock was trading at (Euro, fucking Europeans) 172.38, assume this is a fair value. It now remains to price in the scandal.

-VW has put aside that (euro) 7 Billion to deal with the lawsuits. They are facing $18 Billion from the EPA, and some other lawsuits totalling somewhere around $26 Billion (expected). That shit is never paid 100%, is tax deductible, and paid over many years. The current market is pricing in fines 100% paid in full, and 20% decline in revenue over 5 years. That is not realistic. 

-I think a fair price after the scandal is somewhere around (euro) 150 per share.

Translation: In at $23.97 on VLKAY in a tax exempt account, yacht",5

15-10-07,What does the sub think about the upcoming First Data IPO?,"I'm among the small business customers they're setting aside a portion of the offering for, and considering taking a small position. 

Seems far from a slam dunk, but they're a pretty huge player in the payments space, and I don't think their core business is really that vulnerable to disruption in the 3-5 year timeframe - Square and P2P solutions are certainly waiting in the wings, but there's a ton of organizational inertia in the real cash cow customers of traditional vendors. Plus First Data seems at least decently forward thinking in terms of tech, investing a lot in Apple Pay, etc.

&gt;Based upon the substantial research I have completed on Calithera, I believe that the company presents an excellent investment opportunity at this time. In approximately one month, the company will present two different data sets that will further validate their clinical concepts. CB-839 is being evaluated in a 6 different cancers and preliminary data suggests that these results will be positive. Additionally, the preclinical data for their Immunoncology program will add further value and depth to the clinical pipeline.  With a burn rate of approximately $11.5 million per quarter and $88 million in cash, the company is well funded to advance their pipeline for at least the next 18-24 months. Analyst’s ratings suggest that a fair market value for Calithera is in excess of $17 per share, which I believe to be fair. Institutional ownership is approximately 82%, including a significant position held by Adage Capital who is continuing to buy shares on the open market. This ongoing share acquisition by Adage has provided share price stability while making the already miniscule float much smaller. Combine the upcoming catalysts, ongoing purchases by Adage Capital, the 50%+ short interest and I believe there exists the potential for a “short squeeze” of epic proportions. 


Substantial research is an understatement, but take it as it is; just one individual's DD, not a crystal ball.  He goes as far as analyzing the management of the company, but if you too are searching for yolo the upcoming catalysts were enough to tickle my nutsack.  

What's the deal here, do I link the group or does everyone else just know about that shit?

Say you have a portfolio aimed at savings. So the majority of the investing profile is fixed-income, but there is of course still going to be some higher risk holdings as well. Any money saved from monthly income gets DCA'd into this portfolio according to those allocations.

Now, you have a big expense coming up, say a car. You need to pull some money out of your portfolio for this, but you are by no means depleting it completely. Should you:

A) Sell your holdings according to your allocation percentages to maintain the overall profile of your portfolio?

B) Primarily sell your low-risk holdings to pay for the car, and then DCA back into those low-risk holdings until you are back at your intended profile?

or

C) Do something else entirely?

- Since my last update, WGBS' price hit a peak of 2.08 after announcing (and getting media coverage)  their ICELL8 system. Of course, my funds were tied up elsewhere but I was able to get in today at 1.59. 


-  WaferGen will present a poster at ASHG highlighting data generated by the Company demonstrating the ICELL8 Single-Cell System's ability to identify rare cells from a cell population at a sensitivity of &lt;1%. The poster, number 1906W, will be presented at the conference on Wednesday, October 7, from 6-7pm. Additional details will also available at WaferGen's ASHG booth (number 1027). - See more at: http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/10/06/773782/10151746/en/WaferGen-Launches-the-ICELL8-TM-Single-Cell-System-at-ASHG.html#sthash.hqbbMUS7.dpuf

- I'm playing this stock in the hopes that tonight's catalyst drives up the stock's price - in a sense, a yolo move. However, the only downside I see to this play is that their new product receives public criticism in the scientific community which (so far) seems unlikely. 

- I'm basing my play today on the assumption that tonight's meeting could ONLY be a positive for WGBS, and the worst case scenario is that the price holds around the 1.60 until the end of the week. If this is the case, I'll make WGBS a longer play. If we see another price spike to 1.90+, I'll be selling out.


I'll update this post with more information as it is released about either their new system, or about the price of the stock.

15-10-07,Options 101: You ready to upgrade your rowboat fund to a space yacht fund?,"Disclaimer: If you are learning how to trade options from a WSB post, you probably shouldn't be trading options but I thought I'd add to the sidebar information (YES LOOK AT THE SIDEBAR) for people that are most likely prepubescent beginners... 

Alright idiots, so you ready to gamble some $$$ away and most likely lose it for the chance at a yacht?  Here are some simplified definitions...  

A **call option** gives you the option of buying 100 shares of a stock by a certain date for a set price (Strike Price) (ex. AAPL151009C00110000, is an AAPL call option to buy 100 shares of AAPL at $110 each that expires on 10/09).  You typically trade call options because you think the price of a stock is going to go up.  

A **put option** allows you to sell 100 shares of a stock by a certain date for a set price (Strike Price).  You typically trade puts because you think a stock is going to go down in price.  

Why do we use options?  To leverage our gains.  Let me start by giving a fake example with easy #'s to deal with and why options ""leverage"" your gains.  For this example, I am leaving out brokerage fees, but please look at your individual brokers to see what your fees are for trading options (they're usually more expensive).

We use $1000 to buy 20 shares of $AMD @ $50 on 10/5, all of a sudden Microsoft finally decides they want to buy AMD and the share price goes up to $60 on 10/7.  Hooray awesome, we got 20% ($200) profit, go enjoy a nice dinner.  

Now let's say instead of using that $1000 to buy 20 shares, we used it to buy Call Options instead.  On 10/5, we purchase 100 Call Options of $AMD with a Strike Price of $55 that expires on 10/9 (all options expire on Friday's) for $.10.  The total cost for this transaction would be:

100 Options x $.10 (price of the option) x 100 (# of shares we get for each option) = $1000

So same scenario with $AMD all of a sudden jumping from $50 to $60 on 10/7, let's look at what we have the option of...  We can execute our option to buy 10000 shares of AMD right now at $55 a pop ($550,000 total) and then sell them for the current market price of $60 each ($600,000 total) for a profit of $50,000.  OR more likely we could sell close the option itself because we still poor and don't have the ability to execute those options for something around $50,000 and a ~5000% profit.  

On the other hand of this, the price of $AMD could go down or even go up to 53/54 and your options would be next to worthless because they expire on 10/9 (Why would someone pay $55 for 100 shares when the stock is currently trading below that?  They wouldn't.) 

**Things to keep in mind:**

* Your option is losing value as soon as you buy it (if the price of the stock stays the same) because time is money in the world of options
* The most you can lose is the initial price you paid for your options and you will most likely lose it if you don't know what you're doing
* Look at the rest of the side bar for post-beginner information. 
* Didn't understand this super simplified explanation of options?  Go back to r/investing and put your $$ in low expense mutual funds
* OP when 1 out of 10 of you make mad gains with your inheritance $ from this basic lessons in options trading

TL;DR: Trade stocks for 20% profit, trade options for 5000% profit.  Educate yourself and trade in paper first before losing the pennies in your piggy bank.  Mod me and give me flair.   http://www.investopedia.com/university/options/",81

15-10-07,"[MarketWatch] Apple's real cash pile is 99% smaller than you think","&gt;You’re one of millions of loyal Apple stockholders. And if there’s anything you love more than your new iPhone 6s, it’s the huge $203 billion in spare cash that the company says is sitting in its bank accounts.

&gt;That’s the number widely reported in the media.

&gt;It’s the number that appears on Page 8 of the company’s most recent quarterly financial report.

&gt;It’s a record cash pile for any American company.

&gt;It’s a $50 billion increase in the past 12 months alone.

&gt;And it’s equal to $36 per share, a juicy amount for shares you can buy for around $110.

&gt;There’s just one problem: That spare cash is mostly an illusion, even a shell game, as a new report has just confirmed. In reality, the amount of spare cash that Apple has on its balance sheet is a tiny fraction of that.

Also hires a crisis management/capital advisory services firm.,"Stock saw $0.80 in premarket, opened near $1, and has hovered near $1.30 all day.  Maybe his letter worked? [PDF LINK, ALSO PASTED BELOW](http://www.axionpower.com/profiles/investor/ViewSEC.asp?dHlwZT1wJmI9JklEPTEwOTQ2NzI5)  


**Or** maybe the hiring of Phoenix Capital gave a short term life-line.  One of the things they have done with other companies is secure financing, which Axion needs badly.  Axion is a poorly run company in the fields of Pennsylvania who happens to possess some legit tech for making lead carbon batteries.  This move is the first step in the right directions for quite some time.  If they secure financing to get the delayed rent payment covered and ensure operating costs through, say, FY16 - this stock could see a substantial jump.  It has a (currently) low float and can see big swings.  


&amp;nbsp;

**The letter**  


Dear Axion Shareholders:  



After yesterday's market close, the Company announced that it was unable to reach terms with LCB International, Inc. that would result in a comprehensive agreement for funding and technology licensing as earlier contemplated by the June 2015 binding letter of intent between the parties. We are deeply disappointed in this outcome; however, despite the enormous effort put forth by management and its advisors over the past four months, LCB was ultimately unwilling to work within the framework as set forth in the binding letter of intent, and Axion's efforts were to no avail.  


While the negotiations were ongoing, the Company was also implementing steps to meet its restructure and strategic mission. Key activities included cost reductions in staffing and operations and a substantial electrode production effort to support trial manufacture of carbon lead batteries at outside facilities. Success will allow the Company to sell or lease its underutilized battery production unit. Engineering work progressed on the preliminary design, site leasing and permits preparation for a major frequency regulation project in Sharon PA. The Company's marketing agent, Pacific Energy Ventures, was active in identifying possible financial partners for this project.  


On the research front, the Company continued with bench scale development of its Gen 4 carbon electrode technology. It has also been evaluating advanced materials that could enhance performance and will continue to do so.  To assist and allow the Company to achieve its restructure and to find appropriate strategic partners the Board of Directors has engaged the services of Phoenix Capital Resources and Phoenix Management Services. Phoenix has considerable experience provide proven leadership and experience to the Company in its transition and turnaround from its legacy business to its new high tech strategy. Likewise, the Phoenix Capital Resources team will provide a dedicated effort to find strategic business and financial partners for the Company. Both teams will work side by side with the Company management in these efforts.  



We appreciate the continued short-term lenders and long-term shareholder support, and especially thank the employee team at Axion for their loyal efforts.  


Very truly yours,
/s/ Donald Farley

So my question would be why does the UAW expect to get back to the previous non competitive situation? Based on that statistic it sounds like the Big 3 still need to cut about $1,000 in labor cost per auto to be on an equal playing field with the Toyota, Honda, etc. Why does the UAW feel like auto workers at GM, Ford &amp; Chrysler should make more money than auto workers at Toyota &amp; Honda? Are they not doing about the same job? I think most all of these factories are in low cost of living areas.",3

We have the ability to trade mutual funds, outside of the set options they've provided, but I'd appreciate the opportunity to trade ETF's (lower cost, same day trading, limit orders, better long-term growth opportunity, etc.), but I only have reasons why it's a good idea for me (the employees side).

In other words, how do I convince my employer it's in their best interest to include ETF trading in employee 401k plans?

15-10-08,BRKNG: Increase of downside risks led Fed to hold off rate hike in September,"Fed officials held off of a rate hike in September as many thought downside risks had increased, according to minutes of the meeting released Thursday. 

Officials decided it would be ""prudent"" to wait, even though many thought that the weaker growth outlook for China that emerged in August and the subsequent drop in stock prices around the world would ""likely"" have a small effect on the economy. Some voting members of the Fed policy committee said that these global developments did not increase their confidence that inflation would return to the central bank's 2% target. 

Fed officials were split, with some worried that hiking rates too soon would push inflation lower and others saying that delaying a hike for much longer would risk an undesirable buildup of inflation. In the end, the Fed voted 9 to 1 to hold rates steady.

i was going to put these stickers on it http://www.amazon.com/BLOOMBERG-TERMINAL-KEYBOARD-STICKERS-SHORTCUTS/dp/B007YDMR2U

15-10-08,Is it worth tracking the FTSE Techmark index?,"For those unfamiliar, the [FTSE Techmark index](http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/stock-market-summary/ftse-techmark-100) is a specialised subset of the London Stock Exchange's FTSE index, specifically tracking companies with a technological focus. It is comprised of around 48 companies at the moment (periodically rebalanced so this changes), including ARM holdings,  Cable &amp; Wireless, Oxford Instruments, QinetiQ Group and others.

My main fund tracks the FTSE All-Share index/ASX (not to be confused with FTSE 100 or 250 trackers), but I have a special interest in technology, optimism for the sector, and am able to take a small position in the Techmark as a bit of an experiment in higher-risk investing compared with the ASX.

The risk seems higher because of the smaller number of companies in the index, though it's notable that the Techmark has been more robust than the index as a whole and was not hit as hard by the late-August market drop as the main index.

Like many of you I avoid conventional managed funds so the  [Close brothers' FTSE Techmark tracker](http://www.trustnet.com/Factsheets/Factsheet.aspx?fundCode=K3FTM) seems like a good bet. I am a long-term equity investor so intraday/month movements aren't of enormous concern to me, and the index is doing well YoY and above.

I just wonder if I'm missing something. What does r/investing think about tracking this index?",6

15-10-09,$RXII DD — NASDAQ (non-compliant) .479 — 15 day play (100-150%) -- X-Post from WSB,"**CLOSED -- MARKED FAILED**

Although RXII met the run-up price target, it did so early and was well below that price target on the eve of its catalysts.  From there it failed to meet its price targets.   RXII is still a good stock for a long hold with a reverse split in its future, a possible partner announce, and probably dilution and fund raising.   However the p2 tests and pictures indicate this stock has a bright future and should be watched closely.   Never the less, this DD did not meet its goals in any substantial way and I will take mob run-up behavior and the uncertainty of immediate value into consideration in any future DD.

**CLOSED -- MARKED FAILED**


TL:DR; 2 clinical data presentions 10/15 &amp; 10/21.  Possible 100% gain or more within the next 10 trading days.

-

**IMPORTANT PLEASE READ** RXII is an active JBEM play.  This man does some of the most stellar DD you will ever want to come across but he has a large, rich, and impatient following so his stocks tend to play more like pump and dumps than a normal catalyst stock.  Set your targets VERY conservatively.   Note that as of the time I am writing this you will be able to purchase this stock within a nickel of JBEM’s buy in back in late September.

Note that this DD is written independently of JBEM’s DD.  It was written from the ground up as if it were a new stock symbol to me.  **EDIT BEFORE PUBLICATION** I have read JBEM’s DD after composing this draft.   My DD agrees with his although I am more conservative by fully expressing warrants into the float.

Further note that I opened a small stake when $RXII fell below JBEM’s entry point, and have acquired a moderate stake of 50k shares since with an average of .44. **I AM NOT AN IMPARTIAL PARTY TO THIS STOCK**

-

**The Company and Finances**

-

RXI Pharmaceutical Corporation wants to reduce or eliminate scars and warts and melanoma (skin cancer).   They have had a rather unfortunate experience with Preferred Stock financing and their stock price has suffered for it.   To their credit the company has eliminated their preferred stock.  And like all trial stage companies it has endured and suffered substantial and significant dilution to raise funds.  So the stock is at a rather nicely discounted rate right now for our purposes.

-

The company has roughly $14m in cash on hand with a burn rate of about $700,000 a month.   This tells you that for the duration of this play they are not expected to dilute to raise funds.  They have 61m in outstanding shares and 30m outstanding warrants and options.  I am going to assume all warrants are fully converted for the purpose of my price targets and that will make the float roughly 91m shares.  Institutional holdings are roughly 26m shares but again i am going to assume they are part of the active float.

-

At the closing price of .48 (10/8/15) the company’s fully expressed valuation is 43m.  At a share price of $1 the company’s valuation is $91m.  Keep those numbers in mind because anything over $1 and you need to decide how high is too high given the risks of further dilution and the long months ahead with no news and no income while their trials progress.

-

**THE PLAY**

-

This is a **PLAY** and not an investment.   I, personally am looking only to play into the October 21st run-up where I will decide if the run-up exceeds the value I expect to gain after good clinical data.   Since this is new data at TWO conferences in a relatively short time-frame I am expecting the data to be good.  It makes no real sense to go to ONE investor conference and report bad data from your trials let alone TWO.

-

I am expecting a run up to .60 before October 15.  If the data is good it’s possible it may go to around .80.   If the conference on the 21st presents additional good data we may see the stock over $1.   I personally would consider anything over $1.00 overvalued since it would give the company close to a 100m valuation when they still a long ways away from having a salable product and there will be dilution between now and then.

-

Because this is a JBEM pick (and again I have ZERO issues with JBEM, only the people who follow him) I suggest you set a VERY conservative exit target to avoid the maddening dumps that can happen.   The most conservative strategy is to exit on the run-up to the Oct 15th presentation.  However since the 21st presentation is not so far away it may be worth holding and exiting on that run-up.  But it’s your call.  I personally have set a fixed price limit sell and will be happy to exit with that gain (No I won’t tell you what it is, only that my sell point is below $1.25).

-

**CATALYSTS**

* [Clinical Data Pesenttaion](http://investors.rxipharma.com/file.aspx?IID=4418218&amp;FID=31259239) on October 15th. Run-up possible to .60, .80 if data is good.  If data is not good, the play is probably dead.

* [Clinical Data Presentation](http://investors.rxipharma.com/file.aspx?IID=4418218&amp;FID=31356894) on October 21st. Assuming 10/15 conf went well, run-up .90-$1.  After who knows?

* Remote — Partnership agreement if the data is good but this likely won’t be announced until after the catalysts which is beyond the scope of this DD.

* Start of clinical trials for a new drug indication later this year (Beyond the scope of this DD).

**RISKS**

* JBEM pick so this will react like a pump and dump.  Fortunately the pump hasn’t exactly started yet.

* Warrant selling.  The warrants have a strike of .52 so it’s possible any rise on good data will sell into dilution from warrant owners looking to recoup their initial investment.  **THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OVER $1**, it is a substantial risk lower as well.  Be aware of it.

* **THE DATA IS BAD**, again it doesn’t make sense to schedule two conferences to provide clinical data results if you don’t have good data to show but **THIS IS A RISK** be aware of it.  Edit: From JBEM’s DD (added after this DD was created but before publication)...

&gt;RX-109 doesn't reduce the size of a scar, it prevents the scars from forming. In reviewing the initial data from the 1301 study, RX-109 was found to be no better than placebo when administered immediately following a surgical procedure as the wound was in the inflammation stage.  After two weeks, however, RX-109 had more efficacy than the placebo. The next observation that the panel noticed was the scar still started to grow a little even after a month's treatment. Therefore, they added more doses to attempt to prevent this growing to occur. This is the data that will be presented in October.

So the risk here is that the additional dosages doesn’t stop further growth or that it is little better than a placebo and will have only marginal value.

* NASDAQ delisting possibility if price can’t get above $1 for ten days before next May.

15-10-09,Hedging against your employer?,"Forgive my ignorance on investing, but for the small scale individual investor in an uncertain industry (let's say mining iron ore for sake of example), would they reduce the overall risk of their investing long-term by hedging against the price of iron ore?  That way, if there was an industry down-turn due to ore prices and they lost their job or had to take a pay cut, it would be balanced by great returns on their investments?


It seems to me that personal investing advice doesn't often consider your employer as a source of risk.  I know it's a bit of a strange idea, and I'm not even sure if it makes sense, but what are your thoughts on attempting to mitigate the risks in your employment income?",2

The Company has developed a non‑invasive screening test called Cologuard for colorectal cancer. Its Cologuard test is a non‑invasive stool‑based deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (sDNA) screening test designed to detect DNA markers. In addition to DNA markers, its test includes a protein marker to detect blood in the stool, utilizing an antibody‑based fecal immunochemical test (FIT). The Company's Cologuard test is designed to detect pre‑cancerous lesions or polyps, and each of the four stages of colorectal cancer. By detecting pre‑cancers and cancers early with its test, affected patients can be referred to colonoscopy, during which the polyps or lesions can be removed. The company's test also detects blood in stool, utilizing an antibody based FIT test.

Currently they are the only company with a FDA approved screening test (done non invasively at home) used to test for colon cancer. Currently patients have the option to have a routine colonoscopy done for around $2500-5000 to check for issues or cancer, or they can spend a maximum out of pocket expense of $649 (typically 1/5th the annual premium of health insurance plans). (http://www.cologuardtest.com/what-to-expect-with-cologuard/faq/cologuard-cost-how-much-is-cologuard)


The current test has an 87% accuracy rate. Of the 10,000 patients tested during trials, the test found 92% or cancer cells, and 42% of pre-cancer cells. Of course, the only way to know 100% if a patient has cancer is to have a colonoscopy and have polyps removed and sent out for testing. This test is for those who (typically 55-85yrs) who have a 5yr checkup to have the option to test at home and send results out for testing rather than  having an invasive and expensive procedure performed that could result in nothing found. In this age of medical expenses this is a HUGE deal. 

Originally the FDA approved this test as a FIRST LINE check for colon cancer. On monday they changed their minds and said it can't be used as a first line check, but could be used as an alternative test. (http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/06/exact-sciences-stock-gets-hammered-on-cologuard-re.aspx?source=eogyholnk0000001&amp;utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=article)
 Their stock dropped from $19 to $10. Today the stock dropped to $7.40 and leveled off at $7.80. Last Quarter they posted $8.12mil in revenues, double that of the prior quarter of $4.2mil. (http://www.capitalcube.com/blog/index.php/exact-sciences-corp-earnings-q2-2015/)
After its recent Offering, the company now has $198mil in cash in the bank, plenty to keep them afloat with any sort of cash burn for at least a year or two.
They are in process with getting started on a new $200mil development in Maddison, WI for Headquarters. The plan is to have over 300 jobs by 2017 when its completed. (http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/city-banking-on-exact-sciences-corp-to-deliver-for-judge/article_20a82451-57da-5825-b464-00fdf8da1c52.html)

This stock was recently $35 in June. Yes they have expenses for getting the drug out there and advertised. But its expected to have $60mil in revenue for FY 2015 and $150mil for 2016. 
Earnings are due out OCT 27 before the open and I am guessing revenues in the $16-18mil range putting this stock value at the $9-10 range. Of course there is the recent biotech blunder and this stock has lost over 50% of its value from an, IMO, not a huge deal news break. I believe earnings will take a hit but maybe 25% at most which would drop revenue FY 2015 to about $40mil from the $60mil estimate. 
Analyst average have dropped their PT from $23-25 to anywhere from $7-13. 
There is the bottom oversold play that can be made or a long position started. IMO I have no idea why medicare would chose to pay $2500-5000 for a test they could avoid for $649 on 87% of its patients it pays for. 

You make the call, buy, sell, hold, avoid. 
Would you rather have a tube pushed up you butt for $2500 or poop in a tray and mail it for $649?

In a speech in New York, Lockhart said there is ""a touch more downside risk"" in the current environment than a few weeks ago. 

But he said he was not going to let one piece of data overly influence his outlook. Many economists think the weak September job report rules out a Fed hike this year. Lockhart is a voting member of the Fed policy committee this year and is often a bellwether on the thinking of the moderate center at the U.S. central bank.

shortly after the phone’s launch, there are two different A9 chips: one made by Samsung on a 14nm process, and one (slightly bigger) by TSMC. Apple sourced the chips from two manufacturers in an attempt to reduce the supply problems that are normally a hallmark of iPhone launches.

But the two chips don’t work exactly the same. Although they benchmark with about the same power, the battery life (and excess heat) is different. According to posts on forums and some Chinese sites, phones with the TSMC processor get two hours more battery life on the Geekbench battery test, while running a few degrees cooler.

15-10-09,HELP: Tax-bracket and strategy questions for my portfolio: Roth IRA vs SEP IRA vs Traditional IRA,"Hey guys, I'd really appreciate some seasoned eyes on my situation as the next two weeks are crucial to setting up my foundation. I'm a young, self-employed person, and plan to remain self-employed (unless a crazy good opportunity comes along). I have a few questions regarding my portfolio setup and future strategies, along with Roth/Trad/SEP IRAs. I read a lot on boggleheads, MMM, and this forum exhaustively. 

2014: I contributed 40k to my SEP IRA and planning to make annual contributions moving forward. 

2014: My accountant mentioned something to the fact that my income was too high to put $5500 in a Roth IRA (I made +/- 200-300k in 2014), so I refrained. 

2015: my YTD earnings are in the negative this year because of a sabbatical that I willingly took.

2015: I opened a Roth IRA through Vanguard and started my first $5500 deposit. Can I continue this deposit annually if my taxable income rises again to 200, 400, 800k per year? Will I be subject to any penalties?

How does a traditional IRA factor into all of this? Is it even relevant for my case? Would you suggest? (might want to read rest of post).

2015: I'm going to in two weeks make a minimum 10k deposit toward an Admiral ETF or Mutual Fund via Vanguard. 

2016: I'm planning to enter real estate investing both as a form of diversification, passion/interest, and strategy for realized vs unrealized income. Could I continue deposits in my Roth IRA given my tax bracket would remain similar due to my portfolio strategies?

Quick withdrawal questions:
SEP IRA: can't withdraw this till much later. 59 1/2, right?

ROTH IRA: also can't withdraw this till 59 1/2?

ETF/Mutual Fund: can withdraw but subject to taxation immediately (but no penalties), correct?

so, lots to digest here...in summary:

I plan to have: healthy emergency fund, individual stock portfolio, ETF/Mutual Admiral, SEP IRA, Roth IRA. 

I plan to future consider: Traditional IRA (needed?), Real Estate as I ramp back up in my profession and start earning income again.

Apple is the ""Tesla graveyard"" where failed employees go to work, the electric carmaker's boss has said in fiery comments hitting out at the iPhone maker's ambitions in the auto space.

Elon Musk shrugged off fears about Apple being a new competitor and said that any Tesla employees it had hired were not important.

""They have hired people we've fired. We always jokingly call Apple the 'Tesla Graveyard'. If you don't make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I'm not kidding,"" Musk told German newspaper Handelsblatt, while touring Berlin.

When pushed on whether he took Apple's ambitions in the auto sector seriously, the billionaire's response was even more scathing, mocking the Cupertino, CA-based company's latest products.

""Did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?,"" Musk said.

""No, seriously: It's good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches. You can't just go to a supplier like Foxconn and say: Build me a car.""

Apple was not immediately available for comment.
Apple car 'logical'

Speculation has been building all year that Apple is looking to develop its own electric car and jump into the auto sector. In July, Apple hired industry veteran Doug Betts, who led global quality at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. And in August, ""Project Titan"" – the name for Apple's car project – got more credibility after reports that the firm was looking for an area to test the car in Silicon Valley.
As recently as last month, Apple executives met with officials from California's automotive sector to discuss self-driving vehicles.

An Apple car – whether it be electric or driverless – will compete directly with the likes of Tesla and the traditional carmakers from BMW to Mercedes.

Silicon Valley's biggest technology firms are also looking at the auto space. Google is currently testing its own vehicle while taxi app Uber poached researchers from Carnegie Mellon University to work on autonomous driving technology.

At the same time, traditional carmakers are looking to fend off the threat. Earlier this year, a conglomerate of German carmakers bought Nokia's HERE mapping system which is seen as a key component of autonomous driving.

Musk however admitted that a car would make sense for Apple.

""But for Apple, the car is the next logical thing to finally offer a significant innovation. A new pencil or a bigger iPad alone were not relevant enough,"" Musk said. ",25

------------------  
  
For two years I've been relatively absent from stocks.  During this time, I've undergone a Blythe Masters-esque journey into the heart of this new thing called ""cryptocurrency"".  I've learned an incredible amount and believe that we aren't just looking at some silly ""nerd toy"".   We are witnessing what may be one of the largest shifts in technology and finance the world has ever seen.  
  
The internet started out with just four computers hooked up at various universities in 1969 (some stupid nerd toy), rose to a thousand by the 1980's, and now look at it: the world runs on it.  Cryptocurrency will be the same, but will happen much faster.  
  
Bitcoin rose from mere cents in 2010 to being worth over $1100 each by the dawn of 2014.  If you had of been a little more open minded at the time (and me too) we would be having this conversation on our neighboring yachts right now.  Monero right now is measured in the cents, and I have very specific reasons why it may take the very same journey.  Many times when I discuss bitcoin with people they say, ""I'll just wait for the better sequel.""  Well here it is.  **You want YOLO you filthy animals.  Here's your ultimate fucking YOLO.**  
  
---------------------  
  
**What we are dealing with is a fundamental new form of money, owned by no government or business, being given value purely by way of its utility and the number of people using it**.  The last time that happened was the dawn of gold, thousands of years ago.  But unlike gold, crypto can be transferred instantly across the planet with no one's permission, almost for free.  **That's never happened before in human history**.  And because it is so much better than anything that has ever come before it, I see no other route than for it to eventually dominate the entire global economy.  
  
So I'll entertain, and hopefully a few people who didn't know/care about Monero before will take a look into it.  After the first [2] questions, you'll unlock a Halloween costume.  Subsequent question milestones will unlock additional costumes.  Also, I'm already buzzed so I probably should slow down, but it's Friday afternoon so I'll be doing a bit of drinking while I tell you about this passion of mine.

15-10-10,SEC fee rate always overcharged by 1 or 2 cents?,"I'm building an excel spreadsheet to monitor my trades. I'm using Scottrade and have noticed sec fees are always off by a 1 or 2 cents. Pretty sure I'm missing something. I've looked for hours (sec's site, investopedia, youtube, dreadit, etc.) but couldn't find anything. Anyone here patient enough to explain how the SEC fee works exactly?

Recent examples:

* Sold 240 shares of YHOO @ 30.50 for $7,320. Scottrade fee is $7 and SEC fee should be $0.1347 (7,320 x 0.000018.4). However, Scottrade has the Commission/Fees as $7.15.

* Sold 100 shares of AAPL @ 116.36 for $11,636. Scottrade fee is $7 and SEC fee should be $0.214 (11,636 x 0.0000184). Again, Scottrade has Commission/Fees as $7.22.

I have about 10k to play around with speculatively on the stockmarket. I do have a sizeable portfolio mostly in ETF's so don't stress. I've kept an eye on a few stocks over a few months that are quite volatile (like 5-10% swings in a week) but I believe to be good companies, and occasionally I'll take a 2-5 day swing trade and make a $100 or so. A bit reckless but I find it fun. I put in stops too in case it drops.

I'd like to get into it more, maybe even day trade on my off days, just to make a bit of money. Even $50 profit a day would help being a student and I have the time. So I'd like to know anyone's tips on being a part-time swing/day trader but more as a hobby and to make some loose change rather than as a full-time serious trader.

2. Other question; I'm in Australia, very  resource dominated, and some days I'll check to see if oil/ metal has gone up overnight around the world and try and buy some resource stock as soon as the ASX opens. However I can never get anywhere near the closing price from the day before, it shoots up 5% in ten minutes then drops, so my orders never buy. I'm sure its the big funds or algorithm traders getting in first. Any ideas on how to get the first trades of the day?

15-10-09,ELI5: why do european stocks tend to go up when EUR/USD goes down and vice-versa?,"I notice this mainly in the local (daily, very small term) variations. And specially in this last year.

First thing i check in the morning is EUR/USD: if it is going up considerably, like more than 0.8%, then it is more likely that the main euro indexes are going down. If EUR/USD is going down then... you guessed.

As an example, check [EUR/USD](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/EURUSD:CUR) for the last 12 months, along with the main portuguese and spanish stock market indexes: [PSI20](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/PSI20:IND) and [IBEX](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/IBEX:IND). The [EURO STOXX 50](http://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SX5E:IND) is also worth checking. Focus in Nov 2014 - April 2015.
As a counter-example see the period April 2011 - July 2012. We know that was a turbulent time though.

i know this is far from a ""rule"", and today is proof of that. But it happens more often than not so i'm curious of your interpretations. And, as i said, this is something i notice more on daily variations.

15-10-09,"If you have a long time horizon, why should you hold ANY bonds?","Hi investing reddit,

&amp;nbsp;

Forgive me if this is a ""noob"" question but I don't quite understand this concept: if my goal is to invest long term, why would I want to hold ANY bonds versus keeping cash. I understand fundamentally how bonds work and I understand the ""conventional wisdom"" that says you should hold SOME bonds. 

&amp;nbsp;

However this argument makes too much sense to me: 

Consider today, where I can buy a 10-year government treasury bond at approximately a 2% interest rate. The only way I could gain on the bond principal itself is if interest rates go down (unlikely). Otherwise, I can expect a modest return over time and I can sell the bond if I decide I can invest it in something else.

&amp;nbsp;

The problem is, it seems like I could ALWAYS invest it in a dividend-generating stock that has a higher return. To mitigate the risk of companies going under/companies stopping giving dividends, I instead invest in a &gt;2% dividend ETF. It's possible that I could suddenly get 0% dividend (+ the ETF value goes to 0), but it seems terribly unlikely.

&amp;nbsp;

Given these things, why would I EVER want to hold a bond? I understand that it's basically like a cash equivalent, but isn't it just easier if I hold the cash and wait for opportunities? Am I just hedging against the ""end of the stock market world""? ",2

US oil production has dropped for 5-6 weeks in a row now, but if this passes, it will definitely be a huge wrench in oil's price resurgence. I don't know how much of an effect it'll have on supply, but there's no doubt that there will be an effect. Saudi Arabia is far less likely to consider reducing their output if it passes as well. 

Add the annual seasonal decline in the demand, and I think there may be another dip in the price of oil. There will be an additional  three million barrels a day of oil looking for a home.

15-10-09,[Serious]Question on $AVXLD,"Hey guys,

This is an idea that has been rattling around in my head for a few days now. 

With the conference coming up in November and all the moves this has been making I am confident that there will be very good news. 

Having said that, I am debating something... All my discretionary income has been invested (not just in Anavex) and I have a sizable amount of savings I have been building for a down payment on a house. My dilemma is this: 

A.) Do I buy shares of AVXLD now with the assumption of good news (in this instance I think it is probable) but risk depreciating that principal?

B.) Wait until news comes out and put in a stop-limit order for a higher share price, even though I may lose out on some profits I can de-risk by investing on the run up from good news and possibly double down the amount I would buy with margin since it would be on NASDAQ? (I was thinking, depending on where we end up before the conference, if we are at $10, I would put in a stop-limit order with a trigger at $14 and buy at $14.50 - $15.00) 

If this money wasn't for a house and my wife and I's future I wouldn't be so cautious. What do you all think?

15-10-09,"Index results don't correspond with ETF results?","Fairly new to investing, so please bear with me !

Looking at today's S&amp;P500 results (+0.07%), why do some ETFs I looked up have lower results ?

Vanguards S&amp;P500 ETF (MER, 0.13%) is at -0.39%,
Horizons S&amp;P 500 ETF (MER, 0.17%) is at -0.46%.

Only the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 (MER, 0.07%) seems to truly reflect the S&amp;P500 (over 5 days, 3 months, and 3 years).

Is it the differences in MER that have such a profound effect ?
Can the first two truly be deemed index funds when they regularly stray so much from the S&amp;P500 results ?

I'm looking at Canadian ETFs, so could currency be an issue ? None of these are hedged to the Canadian dollar.

It’s a growing industry, demand for bandwidth exceeds supply. But the product is a commodity product (bandwidth). Right now it’s not clear to me what share of connectivity revenue airlines and satellite service providers will take. Gogo dominates the North American market (by number of planes) and is beginning to expand to the rest of the world and roll out its satellite solution. I calculate below that Gogo is currently fairly valued ($15-16) by a firm level DCF valuation. I show below why in the next year, Gogo’s fair value could be anywhere from $10 to $47 depending on how 2016 unfolds. Downside risks are that Gogo’s loses market share and/or it’s next-stage technology doesn’t translate into higher connectivity rates. Upside risks are that passenger connectivity for its satellite solution grows faster than expected.

- flagging sales, low profit margin, MIA PE/G
- Debt/Equity ratio (17.69%)
- General competition from CALL and others
- low daily trade volume and light options action (the market thinks something is going to happen in December)

&gt;Christopher &amp; Banks Corporation is a retailer of women's apparel and accessories. The Company operates retail stores through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Christopher &amp; Banks, Inc. and Christopher &amp; Banks Company (collectively referred to as Christopher &amp; Banks). It operates approximately 518 stores in 43 states, including 173 Christopher &amp; Banks stores, 85 C.J. Banks stores, 216 Missy, Petite, Women (MPW) stores and 44 outlet stores. It also operates an e-Commerce Website for its brands at www.christopherandbanks.com, which in addition to offering the apparel and accessories found in its stores, also offers sizes and styles available online. Its merchandise assortments include women's apparel, consisting of knit tops, woven tops, jackets, sweaters, skirts, and denim bottoms, bottoms made of other fabrics, leisure wear, and dresses in missy, petite and women sizes. It also offers a range of jewelry and accessories in all stores and on its Website.

**Financials**

They have zero, and, I mean zero debt. In-fact their assets have been constantly growing. As of Q1 2015 they have a total of $200 million in total assets and zero debt, as mentioned before. 

**Catalysts**   
Go long(er). I mean it. WSB I know you’re about YOLO’s but you need something with relatively steady growth to balance out those losses (what losses?!?!). I’m a heavy yolo-er myself but I’ve added $500,000 worth of these shares to my portfolio last Monday at $1.10 which is already a 40% gain if I were to sell now. Believe it or not but in 10 months the target price for this corporation is $8.50. Yeah, a 600% gain if you buy at around $1.40, which, if I were you would be a target entry price. 

I've heavily looked into it and I really don't see why you wouldn't buy this. I know y'all are about YOLO'ing and instant profit, but, you can get a 2%/year VANGUARD fund, invest in the 401K or leverage your mortgage to buy this stock, which I would heavily recommend. Imagine, in a year or so, or, even by Christmas you would have 100% or 600% gains!

So I have been pretty wrong for the last few years thinking the increasing leverage, stock buy backs and PrivateE, Tech valuations are going to bring a lot of trouble for financial institutions.

If the Fed doesn't increase rates, and even follows with another QE I feel like companies are just going to use it to buy more stocks back on leverage.
It also looks like easy unsecured (or share backed) credit to companies like glencore are then going to continue.

With commodities at these levels and the strong dollar isn't deflation inevitable either way?

Wouldn't be increasing interest rates tame debt which otherwise domino fall and tighten credit and spending even more?

If you support near zero or negative interest rates, and further QE why do you feel it would benefit the economy more in the long term?

15-10-11,"Intertrust N.V. book-building closes at Oct. 14, IPO will follow soon thereafter.","Intertrust N.V. (‘Intertrust’ is a provider of, to put it decently, fiscal-friendly trust services. To put it less decently, Intertrusts’ main business consists of helping (large) companies evade taxes as efficiently as possible. Intertrust is one of the (few) large corporate trust services providers. Key facts of the IPO:

* IPO target: obtain €475 million 
* Revenue: €296 million
* EBITDA: €122 million
* Annual growth rate: 6% since 2011
* Annual income growth: 13% since 1011.

Intertrust was established in 1952 by Pierson, sold to Fortis, and sold again in 2010 for an estimated €250 million to Waterland, a private equity firm. A few years later it was sold to Blackrock for an estimated €425-465 million, who owns a 74% stake in the trust service provider.

Max. 42.5% of the total issued share capital will be included in the share offering, with an indicative price range of € 14.50-19.00 per share. This implies that the market capitalisation is assumed to be between [€1,263 and €1,510 million]( http://www.intertrustgroup.com/~/media/Intertrust/Files/Downloads/IntertrustPricerangepressrelease.ashx).  

* Intertrust and Blackstone are subject to a 180 day lock-up;
* Management and employee shareholders are subject to a 360 day lock-up.

A portion of the proceeds will be used to “repay a portion of the Company’s existing debt facilities”, that is putting cash in the pockets of the private equity firms and the stakeholders who provided the loans to Intertrust. In my opinion, this is a red flag. Furthermore, Intertrust is issuing at most 42.5% of its shares, meaning that the majority of the shareholder votes will not come to outside investors, but rather stick with the former owners of the firm. 

On the other hand, Intertrusts’ business model seems sustainable. People fear that trust services may become redundant as Western countries committed to stopping tax evasion, but I would argue that more legislation means that particularly the larger firms like Intertrust will thrive. I base this on the assumption that smaller firms are likely to lag behind when they have to re-adjust to new legislation, while companies like Intertrust have the (intellectual) manpower and resources to find new ways to find ‘fiscally attractive’ structures for firms. These may not be as efficient as the former fiscal structures, but companies will always seek to minimize their tax burden – and that is what companies like Intertrust apparently do best. 

What’s more, increasing complexity of legislation may make it less attractive for in-house counsels to burden themselves with the task of setting up fiscally attractive structures; i.e. they will increasingly outsource their work to trust firms like Intertrust. 

On the surface, I would say this is a solid candidate for further research. Writing in for the IPO is possible until Tuesday. If anyone would like to crunch the financials, you can find the [prospectus to the IPO here]( http://www.intertrustgroup.com/~/media/Intertrust/Files/Downloads/IntertrustIPOProspectus.ashx).

15-10-12,PSA: High Tide Floats All Boats: Be Weary,"Hi Everyone. 

Last week what a great week for small-cap oil companies, but, it's a new week this week and I have some information that could really save your portfolio.   
Have you ever head the saying ""high tide floats all boats""? Well, if you haven't, let me explain it in this context. When the underlying commodity of a stock rises, the equity of a company rises, also increasing their share price. 

Now you may be asking: /u/hypnotwist, what the hell are you talking about? What I'm saying is this week, be weary. I don't know what oil price are going to look like but if you're thinking of going all in on oil companies again, expecting the same returns, you may be brutally wrong.   

Y'all know $PWE. The ticker apparently everyone when balls deep in and made millions off of? Well, lets just say that I have some insider information (I don't work at $PWE) and I can tell you their financials are shit.   
Working off annual data, in 2014 their profitability was -80%. In fact, their selling their office furniture to cover costs. Let that sink in for a second. A company with financials that are **so** shitty they have to sell their ROLLY CHAIRS to barely make ends meet, rose 120%. 

I'll give you a hint, it's not because they all of a sudden hit a goldmine of oil, it's because the oil price rose. It's that simple. 

So... if you were late to the party and decide this week you wanna get in on some small-cap oil companies; think again. 

This is all just an alert, me, watching out for all my YOLO-brothers. 

You may come back next week and say, hey, /u/hypnotwist, you were wrong, oil is up 50000% because Putin bombed Israel, and if so, great! This is only a warning to please; we weary this week, it might not be as great as the last. 

That's all for now.

15-10-12,Thoughts on tax loss harvesting?,"https://www.kitces.com/blog/evaluating-the-tax-deferral-and-tax-bracket-arbitrage-benefits-of-tax-loss-harvesting/

The above link criticizes the long term value of tax loss harvesting. My take away TL;DR of the article is that the only ""gain"" that you have from TLH is that by selling a losing stock, you're capturing a capital loss, and thereby saving on capital gains taxes with a simultaneous sale of a winning stock. 

However, because you're also buying a similar (but not too similar) stock, you've changed your cost basis in the investment, so that you'll have to pay back the capital gains in the future anyways. 

The article then goes on to say that TLH is more tax deferral than tax deduction, and thus the only ""benefit"" is based on how keeping your money from the IRS longer is beneficial.

I'm not certain, but I feel this is incorrect. I thought that the benefit of TLH was not tax deferral, but tax avoidance -- buy selling on a low (and then rebuying a similar stock), you're capturing a loss that can be used for deferring a capital gain. If you're similarly bought stock then goes up you can ""capture"" the capital gain when another stock is harvested.

In short, I feel that this article is completely wrong, but am a bit uncertain, considering that the author is way more well versed in investing than I.

Thoughts? Thanks.",3

15-10-13,Why you should buy VLKAY.,"In case you haven’t heard, Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) has been cheating on its U.S. emissions testing in diesel cars. This won’t just impact sales in the United States, but globally since the cheating has occurred in 11 million vehicles across different markets. Investors are asking if the precipitous drop of nearly 40%+ so far but the rebound will happen soon. If you look at the max graph of VLKAY and other automobile companies that had a similar dip you can see a pretty cool pattern. For example, Toyota had a recall crisis that began in late 2009. TM peaked at $91 in 2009 after recovering from the 2008 financial crisis. When the recall crisis really hit in early 2010 it hit a low of ~$67 and continue to fluctuate between the $60-$90 range. It would not recover until 2012 really, and you might have been stuck with losses for 3 years (and some of the best years in the S&amp;P no less).

I expect a 10+% gain by the end of this week.

3] Dell will be buying the EMC stocks at the end of Q2 2016. 

**B] Questions –**

1] Since Dell will be buying EMC at 33.15$, why is EMC stock not higher?

2] Should investors be putting money in EMC now at 28$/ stock and getting 5$ per stock after 3 quarters?

2.1] If yes, why are investors not buying this stock right away (which would increase the price) ?

3] Will EMC stock climb higher than 33.15$?

I got about $600 I want to put into something. I was thinking BRK.B I heard they are pretty low right now. I think its a pretty safe investment considering Warren Buffet is in charge. My question is what are the chances of this stock going way down if anything happens to Buffet? I feel like it can do a complete 180 and drop like a stone. 

What other stocks are a good option for a nice gain? I was looking into GE, but it seems like they are pretty expensive right now they have been climbing. Id love to buy more Starbucks but they are very high right now I feel like its a bad time to enter. 

PG is another option for me I keep hearing great things, but im not to sure about if they are too expensive right now or not.

It's just a silly project for myself. But now I am wondering if other people might enjoy an app which tracks countdowns to these different things as well as their current values.

For it to be useful it would have to be generalized enough for more than 1 company. So I'm wondering if most companies do ESPP the same way my company does.  We have a 6 month period over which a percentage of your pay check is set aside. At the end of that 6 month period, the lower of the price at the start and the price at the end of the period is selected. Then discounted 15%. That price is then used when purchasing the shares with he money set aside over the 6 month period.

15-10-12,"Why ""The single greatest predictor of future stock market returns: investor allocation to equities"" is wrong","Hey guys, my mate (interested in some finance stuff) recently sent me a reddit link with a long-term investment model asking me to check it ([here is the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/2ptjkk/the_single_greatest_predictor_of_future_stock/).

I actually wanted to answer to the post because it has been upvoted more than 200 times and mostly praised, but since it is already archived, I can't.

Just wanted to say that the model has fundamental methodological flaws. First of all, this method seems to do nothing except correlating the actual prices with the following 10-year-returns. I know, the author mixes in some sophisticated-sounding stuff. But for simplification, we can also use the normalized S&amp;P 500 like [here](http://oi60.tinypic.com/2me242q.jpg). This is nothing but simple value investing. Only that it's worse, because monthly data is used while calculating a moving 10-year-average. This results in data overlapping which makes no sense when you try to find relations between two time series.

Why? Let's say that in t0, our index is 1000 and expected 10-year-returns are 5%. Now in t1, the index decreases to 900. Obviously the expected returns have to increase to a level higher than 5%, because this last price drop of 100 now falls out of the 10-year data (the only exception where expected returns will fall too is when index drops even higher in t10-t11). If the index falls even further in t2, then the 10-year-return-rate will also increase further. Likewise, if the index gains, then the 10-year-returns must decrease. I plotted the same ""model"" with completely random data [here ](http://oi60.tinypic.com/2ev9dtf.jpg). Even this random walk suggests we should buy low and sell high.

TL;DR: The ""model"" is bad because the methodology sucks (and generally, the whole idea).",3

I then had a limit order purchase of 40 shares of TSLA at $220 this past Friday, this was roughly 3-4 weeks after I had sold. The purchase went through, but what is disconcerting is that the average price shown now in the dashboard is ~$232. The amount withdrawn from my account to pay for the purchase is in accordance with the $220 price, so I'm not sure if more funds will be withdrawn from my account to match the $232 x 40 purchase price?

Is this supposed to be beneficial to me, as that seems to be the only way it makes sense to me after reading on the WASH sale rule? Coz now I can hypothetically sell them for $231 a piece and claim a loss (as it is &lt; than $232) but actually make some money out of the sale.

 Or will this somehow bite me in the ass when I eventually sell the 40 TSLA stocks? Please ELI5 if possible.

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

**Excerpt:**

&gt; ""So what did I learn from my plight? First, that I took a big risk when I created a portfolio that was wildly different from Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index. That was especially problematic in 2014, when hardly anyone beat the index. Magnifying the problem was my decision to put too much money into my favorite ideas. I totally bought into the notion that it was foolish to invest in my 60th-best idea. What I overlooked was how bad things could get if I was wrong about my second-best, third-best and fifth-best ideas at the same time. So now I plan to invest a chunk of the family portfolio in index funds—oh, the horror!—and put most of the rest into companies that should do at least okay no matter how the world changes. In other words, I’m buying the kinds of companies owned by Warren Buffett, who has long recommended owning stocks you’d be happy to hold even if the markets were closed for five years.""",5

I am young and don't mind the the risk of ETFs so I decided to go with 50% VTI, 20% VXF, 20% VXUS and 10% BND. However after doing some more reading Mutual Funds seem to be the more popular choice so I've been considering taking that route. If that's the case I was considering total stock market (VTSMX) 50%, international (VGTSX) 20%, mid-cap (VIMSX) 10%, small-cap (VISVX) 10% and bond (VBMFX) 10%. Maybe take out 10% from VTSMX and put it in healthcare fund? Not sure which route to take, ETFs or Mutual funds. Any input is appreciated thanks!

15-10-13,Want to make a 10% gain here is my opinion on $VLKAY.,"We saw the biggest plunge in 6 years in one of the biggest automobile history. We've also seen big plunges from other big automobile companies such as Toyota, GM, etc.,

After some research these companies came back and rebounded at 20%+ gains in less than 2 months. $VLKAY declared it will switch to a new emissions control setup in Europe and North America as well as cut €1B ($1.1B) in annual investment spending. The new system will be installed ""as soon as possible,"" and will use a mixture of the chemical substance urea and water, VW brand head Herbert Diess said in a statement. Yesterday, Standard &amp; Poor's lowered its rating on Volkswagen from A to A- on concerns over the emissions scandal.

Have you guys heard of these companies... Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Porsche? Well if you have... guess who owns them. That's right, Volkswagen. You guys might say that there will be more problems down the future because its been up 20% since the last week. But It's very simple..imagine you're in school and you turn in an assignment late. The teacher may fail you. Now what happens if everyone in class turns it in late. The teacher has to reconsider, he or she can't fail everyone. It looks bad for her as it does for the students having a class where everyone fails the assignment, and parents will get mad too. So the teacher will compromise and everyone gets off easy...it's like the Nash Equilibrium where no winners produces the best outcome.
So in the past 3 weeks there have been revelations of more emissions offenders, which , counterintuitively, analogous to the student example, lessens the punishment for each manufacturer , since the emissions standards were probably too rigorous to begin with. Weird world of economics and game theory.

Heres what I think...

Moments like this are when people can actually make a lot of money. This is exactly Warren Buffet's strategy on how he accumulated his wealth. We all know the saying - be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy. But how many of us actually practice it? I would guess and say not too many. Most follow the herd.
Finding extremely good companies that go through a scandal that have a selloff that's unwarranted is exactly how he accumulated his fortune. If you wait until everyone says that ""Volkswagen is back to where they were before the drop"" you're going to be looking at pre-scandal or higher than pre-scandal prices. Volkswagen isn't going anywhere. Look at the balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement. They are the largest company in Germany employing over 600,000 people. I've seen so many people posting that this is going to crush Volkswagen. Uhh… no it's not. Did what they do kill anyone? No. Did BP spill millions of gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico, killing the sea life there, affecting millions with their jobs (fishermen, restaurants and hotels along the coast, etc.), yes. Did they recover? Yes. Did GM have an ignition switch that was blowing up and killing people and pay a fine that's a fraction of Volkswagen? Yes. At the end of the day, Volkswagen may have cheated the emissions system, but it's coming to light that many many many other car manufacturers are doing the same. They are emitting extra pollutants into the air. What's the big concern - global warming? There is a lot of data out there that says global warming doesn't even exist.
At the end of the day, being a smart investor, you need to realize opportunities when you see them. In my opinion this was screaming opportunity and I bought on the way down and sitting with an extremely nice gain so far. I don't plan on selling in the immediate future but know that at some point it will be nice to lock the gains and wait for the next news story to happen that crushes the share price of a great company and then those shares will be at a discount.

Volkswagen will have a 10%+ increase by the end of this week. I would sell it at a 7-8% gain if you guys want to keep it safe and not YOLO then buy it again when it dips.

Have fun.

15-10-13,New to stocks seeking help,"Hi, so for my highschool economics class we're doing a stock market simulation. I was wondering what stocks would be good to invest in and what will bring us the best results in our time period. We have $100,000 and until December 4th to see how I stocks do. Any help is much appreciated.",2
15-10-13,Trader types,"As requested. This is not my work - dunno who I should credit though.

1)    MR. JOHNNY BUYSIDE:
-This is the guy(girl) who knows how to work the sell side street system.  He goes out to all the greatest restaurants, private golf courses and his calendar is fully booked.  Front Row Knicks…Not a problem when you got your broker taking you.  Never says no to a hot concert or night club.  Works great with sales traders who are the “rock star”.  Wine list..He(she) will always ask for it and go straight to the special cellar reserve list.  
-Can I get two desserts to go?
 
2)    MR. FIGJAM (Fuck I’m Good, Just Ask Me):
-Do I need to say more?  Guy is Mr. Know-It-All.  When you broke to this trader, he(she) on a simple trade idea and this trader will try to teach you why the trade was actually their idea first and then go into detail about calculations you will never care about (of course it was something they just learned 20 minutes ago on Investopedia).  As far as he is concerned he is the reason the fund even has AUM.  The entire street sucks to them and they think they are the next DTIT (David Tepper in Training)
 
3)    MR. 1 BIPPER/ALGONATER:
-This Trader thinks there is zero need for high-touch sales trading.  They execute everything in the machines in algos.  Of course come deal time or when they need risk pricing on a piece of merchandise they wonder why they get shut out.  Everything is about dark pools and TCA’s.  Of course when it comes to servicing and color, they have no problems to reach out to their high touch sales coverage for information.  When they are done with their day, they go straight home and play COD or MW3.  Nothing to them is done in real life. 
 
4)    HULK TRADER:
-You missed VWAP by 3 bps??? This trader will be the first one to Bloomberg you and say, “CALL ME”.  Your TCA report sucked?  He will turn green on you and ask to speak to Jamie Dimon to request coverage change.  You miss 2% of the overall volume because you’re still on the offer in queue?  Your entire desk can hear him screaming through the phone.  Of course if they end up losing their job, they immediately become Bruce Banner trying to befriend the entire street looking for their next seat.  
 
5)    THE WALKING TRADE ERROR:
-We all know a few of these.  This trader seems to always forget to enter the order by the open, or went the wrong way on a trade.   Of course, they always ask for a “favor” to see if you can print them on something or help them out.  You can figure out who these traders are when you walk in.  Ways to identify them?? Look for the mis-matched socks, food stains on their shirt, and a time sheet of market openings taped on the side of their computer screens that looks 5 years old. 
 
6)    BLUE DOT/YELLOW DOT TRADER:
-This trader is never on their desk.  Their Bloomberg status is always either Blue or Yellow 16 minutes after the market opens. They always write… Can you work this now, I’ll send a FIX order later on this afternoon.  Occasionally after a while they try to go Grey Dot on Bloomberg, but unless your name is on the front door of your office, we know you shouldn’t be Grey Dot status.  Stop Fronting….
 
7)    THE CREEPER: 
-This trader only wants to have attractive female coverage.  This is their form of lost time make up dating.  It usually makes up for their lack of prom dates in high school or that their first kiss was in their Junior year of college spring break.  You can spot these traders if by their attention span at meetings where they have zero questions for the global head economists in the room doing the meeting but wants to find out where the recent college grad grew up.  They fall for the Emoticons/Smiley faces in the IB Chats all day long.
 
8)    DON’T CALL ME MAYBE TRADER:
-This trader hates phone calls.  And if you do get him on the phone he sounds like a dead fish (try to pause,..all you will hear is heavy breathing).  Prefers everything on IB Chat or Bloombergs only please.  Problem is when you send him Bloombergs he has you on restricted (#4).  You can tell this trader easily by looking at their cell phone.  It has 15,000 messages per month on Whatsapp, SMS and Instant Msging but only 3 phone calls made and probably has 2 cats at home.   
 
9)    THE HIPSTER TRADER:
-This new breed of buy-side trader is younger, has floppy hair and tries their best to understate their intelligence.  They try to act like they are borderline index hugging the 100 on the IQ scale when in reality they are Mensa, Master Chess players, and straight up nerd back in college/PHD until they got the new hair dew like they just woke up.  Be very careful of these traders as they will catch you off guard.  I like to call them John Nash meets Manhattan Beach.

15-10-14,"$OMER DD — NASDAQ — $11.65 (4 month hold, 50%-100%, high risk)","TL;DR: An earnings play betting a company with a new drug can start making money to become profitable by Q4 ER (February 10th or so).  If they can pull it off there’s a potential for a 100% gain in the next 4 months.

-

**INTRO**

-

Before we begin let me stress that this DD is **HIGH RISK**.  I’m projecting growth of a new product onto a new market and saying that OMER is going to become profitable by Q4.  I only have numbers from the centers for disease control and numbers from medicare to project the potential number of patients and the potential price OMER will get and all of that is a huge guessing game.  

If OMER doesn’t sell its product as well as I think it will, this DD WILL fail and the price WILL probably fall.  And this risky play is playing right into all the biotech stock price crashes and volatility we’ve experienced recently.  Still this is a bet and the numbers look promising.  Lets see if you want to play their November 10th and February 10th earnings.

-

**THE COMPANY**

-

Omeros Corporation ($OMER) has a FDA approved drug,  [Omidria](http://www.omidria.com), which is used during cataract surgery.   In Q1 they did their first trial roll out of the drug and in Q2 they did a broad launch.   The tricky thing here is that the first launch was too small to be statistically significant and the second was just ramping up as they started their Q2 earnings report.   I would have been more comfortable with doing this report after the Q3 report is out but that’s a pivotal ER for the company and likely any DD after that point will be fairly useless as the market will have already rushed to appropriately value the company.  

So here’s the deal.   I expect Omidria to show much better sales than it did in Q2 because its been out longer, more wholesalers are selling it and the marketing people have been reaching out.  The question remains, is it enough to make the company profitable?   Probably not, but it might narrow the losses enough to show that the potential for profitability is there, in which case OMER should see a not insignificant rise in its share price.  

Its Q4 earnings should be the real showcase of whether they have a drug that can sustain the company.  It’s possible the company will achieve profitability in Q4.

-

**THE FINANCES**

-

OMER has 38m shares outstanding with another 10m in warrants and options giving them a total float of 48m shares (Well how I calculate it anyway).   At $11.67 this gives the company a valuation of 560m. This is an IMPRESSIVE valuation.  Truly so!  Considering that I usually look at stocks like BGMD, AMDA, and ATEC this stock looks truly bloated.   But lets dig into this just a little.   According to the [CDC and Medicare 3m cataract surgeries are done each year](http://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/2009/r090128.htm) in the US alone.  We can assume similar numbers in Europe (no data was found but balance exchange rates and lower profits with larger health care coverage).  So that’s 6,000,000 potential drug sales of Omidria.

According to medicare Omidria is re-imbursable under Part B and Part C and has a wholesale value of  [$465 per dose](http://www.omidria.com/wp-content/uploads/procedure-guide.pdf).   

&gt;Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) for OMIDRIA is $465 per single-patient-use vial.


I’m going to go conservative here and say that OMER gets 25% of that (discounts, rebates, etc).  That should give Omidria a conservative $116 per dose.  Multiply this by 6m patients and we get revenues of $696,000,000 per year.   Of course we’re still ramping up so it will take some time to get to that number but Omidria’s current 560m market cap is looking pretty spot on.  In short — the market has valued OMER very close to its optimum revenue stream from Omidria alone.

To give you an idea of why I’m projecting profitability in Q4, consider that in Q1 their revenues from Omidria was $250,000 when they did their limited release but just PARTIAL quarter revenues from their expanded release in Q2 was 3.1m.   It would not surprise me to see revenues in q3 approach 10m and then 25m in Q4.

As OMER starts collecting on that stream the multiples will start kicking in the closer it gets to actually achieving 700m a year in revenues.  In a year it would not be unreasonable to expect OMER to be trading around $30-$40 a share and more if OMS-721 clears P3 and OMS103 license revenues start kicking in.

In the meantime OMER has almost 60m in cash, 20m in immediate bills, and they burn 5.3m a month.    Put another way OMER has cash on hand to see them through 7 months before they’re broke — assuming their revenues do not improve.  Fund raising is a substantial risk in the next three months but I am betting they’re going to hold off as long as they can to see share prices increase as their revenues increase and dilution (if any) will happen after Q4.   This DD goes through Q4: unless Q4 is profitable **IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED YOU DIVEST YOURSELF OF THIS STOCK AFTER Q4 ER** but look for a re-entry point shortly before Q1 ER (April 10 or so) or after the dilution.

-

**THE PLAY**

-

Buy and hold and see if it pays out on Q3 ER, hold through Q4 for maximum gains if Q3 looked good.   Option players can probably set up a few calls around the expected Q4 ER for maximum gains but be careful of the expected dilution after Q4 ER!

-

**CATALYSTS AND TARGETS**

-

* Q3 ER — Expect increased earnings from Omidria in the US as its sales increase.   Possible [revenues from it’s OMS103 drug](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1285819/000119312515223964/d942794dex991.htm) which is licensed to Fagron but is just out of P3 trials so this may more of a 6-12 month scope.  Possible revenue from compassionate use of OMS-72.  I’m targeting a trading range around $15/sh.

* Q4 ER — Expected increased earnings from Omidria in the US over Q3.   Expect new revenues to start showing up from Europe (small at first but growing).   Possible [revenues from its OMS103 drug](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1285819/000119312515223964/d942794dex991.htm) licensed to Fagron.   Revenues from compassionate use of OMS-721 (increasing).  This ER will be the biggest indication of whether OMER is going to make it as a company.   I’m targeting a trading range of $20-25/sh after ER if the company is profitable and $15-$20/sh if the company is NOT profitable but has taken loss per shares down to a nickel or so.

* OMS-721 (**EDIT AFTER PUBLICATION** ~~cleared phase 2~~ Last P2 update was on August 18th), Possible announce of P3 trial later this year.  ([I have no idea what this drug does](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/omeros-shares-doubling-positive-phase-154747508.html) or treats but it’s fast tracked and orphaned and can be used for compassionate use in Europe and possibly now in the US.

* (Remote) Possible announce of resumption of clinical trials for OMS824 for Huntington’s and schizophrenia (suspended because of some sick rats).

* (Remote) Possible announce of p1 trials for some of their other pre-clinical pipeline products.

-

**RISKS**

-

Good lord this company has risks!   One third of their 10-q goes into their risks but it all boils down to “We may not be able to commercialize Omidria enough to be profitable.   But there are some other risks as well.

* A generic drug company filed an IND to create a generic version of Omidria, OMER’s ONLY revenue producing drug!   There will be a legal battle and the [paperwork is already filed](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1285819/000119312515311281/d62513d8k.htm).   But the expense of litigation is not good for a company that already is not profitable.   But fortunately in the four month play the legal expenses will be fairly minimal and the chance of losing (Case dismissed) fairly minimal in my opinion (which is not a legal opinion).  Likely there may be a settlement before Q4 which may be a catalyst (although minor).

* **They can’t commercialize Omidria and it doesn’t meet my revenue projections.**  If Q3 does not show improved revenues from Omidria the play will probably fail.

* The company announces OMS824 will not proceed with trials.  That’s 2/5ths of the company’s pipeline.

* Dilution.   The company loses a lot of cash each month.   While I believe they have enough cash on hand to easily make it through the time frame of this play, if the company sees an opportunity to raise funds, it will do so.

&gt;We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and revenues, together with capital that we may have the opportunity to **raise through public or private equity securities sales**, through the issuance of additional debt, through corporate partnerships, through asset sales or through the pursuit of collaborations and licensing arrangements related to certain of our programs will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating expenses, capital expenditures and interest and principal payments on our outstanding notes for at least the next 12 months.

* Of course there's also usual product liability.  If someone goes blind because of the drug that could be a risk.  But considering this cleared the FDA that should be a relatively small risk.

**************************************

Ok now lets talk about Solar Edge Technologies

I've been following this stock for 6 months and I like it a lot. I got in early when the company went public at $24, then bought more at $39 and then again at $23. I have half of my portfolio invested in this stock. 

But Savantness, why? 

1. I'm young and I can take risk
2. I want to make bank bro, I want to get ass

Ok now to the DD. 

Solar Edge is not a straight solar company, they manufacture power optimizers and inverters for solar tech. So they improve existing solar plants, do not create new ones. 

Fundamentals:
P/E: 40.24
Forward P/E: 10.97
PEG: 1.39
EPS growth next 5 years (proj): 29%
ROE 151.2%
Debt/Equity: .01
(meaning for every .99 cents in equity there is .01 cents in debt. So as they grow they can take on a lot more debt leading to even faster growth.)
Avg Target Price: 37.31

Risks:
high volatility: 6.8%
In 2016 solar will not get the tax credits it currently does, down to 10% from 30% in the US
Europe may remove their incentives as well, or add some. Hard to tell. 
Small cap company
Price very influenced by earnings and solar industry as a whole
Company is incorporated in Delaware but is located in Israel, so region risks.

Other Positives:
Solar technology rapidly growing
Elon Musk is pro solar, never know what he has planned
SEDG works alongside Tesla and Solar City, Solar City is 19% of their business
Guy Sella, the CEO seems impressive

Conclusion: $SEDG is going to the moon.",11

15-10-14,"How A Amedica Corporation / Alphatec Merger Could Be The All Time Blockbuster In The Medical Device Space (AMDA, ATEC)","&gt;Summary

&gt;* Industry consolidation is a reality than can no longer be ignored. Going private is no longer an answer when faced with potential explosive growth in regenmed space and healthcare in general.

&gt;* An AMDA/ATEC holding company can diversify the combined entity into two very promising treatments, hedging away risks, and possibly even dominating the entire market on double success.

&gt;* New changes in FDA and Healthcare (Hillary &amp; Bernie) provide a favourable environment for medical devices companies in the long term, especially with R&amp;D in consideration.

&gt;* Anthem Cigna shows us the pure potential of a merger.

&gt;Alphatec has provided us with substantial clarity as to the ongoing concerns of its business in its most recent Q3 prelims

Cigna Anthem worked brilliantly.

""I realized technical analysis didn't work when I turned the charts upside down and didn't get a different answer…""

- Warren Buffett

Pressured by the fear of missing out (FOMO) on the gold rush, M&amp;A bankers in 2015 have done a record $2.2+ trillion of announced deals already besting the 2007 record. At the same time, there's a perfect storm brewing in healthcare, biotech, and pharmaceutical stocks that's bound to start raining big dollars and yachts on investors who can see past the next supposed paradigm shifts being suggested in a Clinton presidency. We've reviewed the weather reports and what follows is our take on the most logical, no-brainer deal in the medical device space:

Merge Amedica Corporation (AMDA) and Alphatec Holdings (ATEC) into a holding company with James M. Corbett and Sonny Bal as Co-Chairmen.

Let's call this article crowd sourced investment banking through sifting through Piper Jaffray, Jefferies papers, as well as Cantor Fitzgerald's notes on the overall sector... We don't by any means want to disrupt our friends in their yachts and NY condos, give us a chance. They are in a race to do deals these days as the inevitability of a Fed rate rise edges closer. Right now, no better space has more promise for deals than Healthcare. Specifically, medical devices, med tech, given the recent waves of political sandstorms from this election campaign. Particularly we eye the very ripe, sweet and low hanging fruit we see in a Amedica/Alphatec all stock tax-free merger.

Readers of this article are welcome to donate to the future broke futures brokers yacht fund.

Getting the no-nos' out of the way first

* Despite the bad luck timing of the Amedica offering in the 2015 financial volatility swings, the model of leveraging immense income potential via approval, has been discredited; we believe greatly. Also at the time of Amedica coming to market, many industry participants questioned the IPO and the trust of Sonny Bal. The subsequent storm and debt death spiral has led to AMDA becoming a penny stock also suffering from structural issues directly unrelated to the volatility of the market.

* Medical devices and private equity ownership are simply never a good match. They invariably involve adding debt to businesses that by their nature will always need to consume capital like contestants in a perpetual hot dog eating contest. That is-- The cashburn is just insane, and for companies without income streams, debt just makes no sense. New opportunities might open up to the PE elsewhere nd you want to be there. Old investments (like AMDA) get tired, you need to massively dump it. You need to be open to opportunities for smart acquisitions. Balance sheets must have defined roadmaps that start with development debt and end in accretive cash flows and diminishing long-term liabilities. It's always been the way of the healthcare world and always will be.

* Junior Healthcare companies don't really address the pressing reality of industry consolidation

* They simply exchange one basket of risks for another. They have their value but also some aspects of three card monte shuffles. When offered a healthcare investment, investors need to ask the time-tested old question, reputedly attributed to Lenin.

&gt;When asked how to know who's the hidden power behind sudden policy changes in countries he replied, ""I need no diplomats or secret agents. I merely read about events in the newspapers and ask myself one question: Who benefits?When I get the answer history rarely proves me wrong.""

* That quote is a bit disingenuous for the father of the KGB, but revealing anyway. Who benefits most from Healthcare spinoffs/carve outs/PE injections? Mostly large, inside holders.

&gt;As interest rates rise, many risky bet stocks will fall.

&gt;But no matter what goes down... ask yourself the Lenin question: Who benefits? Nobody needs a road map from me to figure this baby out. Healthcare PE investments are a lot like sugar highs for the insiders spiking for the moment but realistically not much in nutritional value for long-term investors. They're not terrible yet there are better long-term yields to be found in solid, dividend paying stocks with long-range upsides not collared by what could become punitive gains in uncharted marketplace waters downstream.



Why the healthcare space is ripe for consolidation now




Given this situation, we believe the neatest solution to healthcare industry challenges today lies either in mergers or acquisitions of sympatico partners. Here's why:


1. US regional medical markets are now fighting a two front war. One battle is against saturation as more tax-starved states attempt to claw back at tax income and ignite border wars for metro feeder markets. On the other front, they're combating the demographic aging out of the most traditionally robust segment of the customer base: older individuals aged 45 to 75. These specific companies, obviously aren't planning to capitalize on millenials.


2. Dr. Sonny Bal, chairman and CEO of Amedica Corporation stated the following in the company's 4Q and FY 2014 financial release:

""This past year has been remarkable for Amedica and I'm pleased to see that momentum carry into 2015. We believe the recent clinical, financial, and regulatory developments position Amedica to capture additional market share, enhance our ability to demonstrate the benefits of silicon nitride and promote wider adoption of the material across a number of biomedical platforms. I'm proud of the significant achievements our dedicated team has accomplished to-date, as we seek to leverage the opportunities these achievements provide throughout the balance of this year.""

3. According to the company's April 2015 investor's presentation, the Kyocera partnership will reduce manufacturing costs by 25% in 2015 and will promote rapid expansion of silicon nitride implants globally while eliminating capital costs and decreasing cash burn.

4. Jim Corbett, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alphatec Spine. ""We have significantly expanded our coverage in those territories of the U.S. market where we historically did not have Alphatec representation. Through this expansion we have increased the number of distributor relationships and the surgeon customers that we serve. We estimate that we will realize at least $3M of revenue from these new markets in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. Increasing our global commercial participation in the spinal fusion market remains a key pillar of our overall company strategy and we are making meaningful progress both in the U.S. and internationally. Our efforts during the third quarter to expand and transform our commercial execution will support future revenue growth for Alphatec in 2016 and beyond.""

**This merger would be the most accretive med tech merger and help the 2 companies hedge out their respective risks.**

For those who don't know. Loyal3 offers commission free trading and even allows you to purchase partial stock. But, they decide when to execute the order, they do so only once a day and they usually do so when there are enough buyers to make one bulk purchase. There is no guarantee you will get the stock at the price you wanted. They just say you have to make sure you have enough money in your account to cover the purchase. So basically you give someone as much money as they want to do the purchase. That's even worse than a market order. Why the fuck would anyone in their right mind trade with Loyal3? Did I miss something? Are the brokers geniuses? Or are people really willing to give their money away like that?",3
15-10-14,First Data (FDC) re-IPO worth it?,"[First Data Corporation](https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/home.html) is a global payment technology solutions company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The company's STAR interbank network offers PIN-secured debit acceptance at ATM and retail locations.

First Data has a global footprint of 6 million merchants, the largest in the payments industry. The company handles 45% of all US credit and debit transactions, including handling prepaid gift card processing for many US brands such as Starbucks. It processes over $1 trillion in card transactions annually, with an 80% market share in gas and groceries.

They privatized back in 2007 which was disastrous but now with the rise of EMV chips in the US, this could be a good trade. I mean damn they hold 80% of the market share.


First Data is seeking to raise as much as $3.2 billion in an offering scheduled to price Wednesday in New York. That would make it the biggest U.S. IPO this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is selling 160 million shares for $18 to $20 each and plans to use the proceeds to repay debt -- which stood at about $21 billion at the end of June -- and for general corporate purposes.

Credit rating: B (Standard and Poor)

[Quarterly earnings:](http://investor.firstdata.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=111215&amp;p=irol-irhome)

Q2 consolidated revenue of $2.9 billion, up 1% YoY; segment revenue of $1.8 billion,
up 1%, or up 5% excluding currency impacts

Q2 net loss of $26 million improved by $8 million, up 24%; Adjusted net income of
$150 million improved by $63 million, up 72%

Q2 Adjusted EBITDA of $702 million, up 3%, or up 5% excluding currency impacts
Strengthened capital structure with new revolving credit facility and new term loans

[More info](https://i.imgur.com/PwlKom2.png)

Overall debt: $18 billion (bruh)

But all of this may set up First Data for a decent valuation when it comes public. All of the proceeds are going to reduce debt -- cutting borrowings at interest rates of 11.25% and 12.625% -- and the company has said it also has opportunities to refinance at lower rates some of the $18 billion debt load that will remain after the IPO.  Company lost $138 million in the first six months of 2015 but that was interest costs of $813 million. On a pro forma basis, interest costs would drop to $630 million for the half year given the debt that will be paid off.

Attempt to [try to appeal to Millennials.](https://www.firstdata.com/en_us/all-features/millennials.html)

Like I said with the IPO and the switch to EMV this could definitely go to places beyond where it is today. The debt they went into seems to have paid off as they established a market share of 80%, and they could reap the benefits over the next few months or years as the switch occurs and the old technology is phased out. Yeah sure this should be in /r/investing but could this be a good place to make a quick buck for at least a week? You decide. ",2

15-10-15,"I know dividend investing isn't all that popular...","I'm not a newcomer, but I'm definitely an amateur.  Been doing this a few years, but only recently started paying attention to things like dividends, especially with the recent downturn.  I know dividend investing isn't popular around here, and with good reason considering the amount of yield chasing that occurs when people start looking at just dividends.

For me, I have some difficulty pushing money into index funds.  I know they are super popular around here and with very good reason.  However, when the market drops, it causes me a huge amount of anxiety because all the gains are only on paper.  Furthermore, I struggle with the idea of only taking out gains when I'm 65.  I want to live now, and not end up traveling the world with bum knees and a bad back at 72.

My thought is to take all the money I could possibly spare out of weekly income (i.e. everything that's not totally necessary for life itself, like rent), and pushed it into monthly-paying dividend ETFs.  For example, SDIV and PFF.  Then mail the biweekly dividend payouts, and start using them in day-to-day life.  From a lifestyle perspective, I'm giving myself a raise every month, and the instant payoff helps me to actually push money into these investments.  From an investing perspective I'm saving a lot of money very fast.  It might seem annoying to push money around like that, but the psychological benefit to moving my lifestyle onto investment dividends on a gradual basis is pretty high.

On to my questions.

1) Is anyone else doing this or anything like it (structuring their investments to achieve financial independence on a slow slope rather than an abrupt future event)?

2) Where are the problems with investing money in moderate-paying low-expense dividend ETFs?  I'm having a tough time finding much information on income investing in general, and dividend ETFs seem to be a bit of a rare breed.  Most folks doing income investing seem to like picking individual stocks but I feel quite unsafe doing that.

(I understand my money will grow faster in Vanguard funds, but for me the psychological safety of taking safe gains on a continual basis helps me to sleep better at night.)

I picked SDIV and PFF as examples.  SDIV is pretty volatile and has heavy financial and mREIT exposure, but seems spread out over a fairly broad spectrum and the recent market tumult has not beat this down particularly hard.  PFF is more stable, and although it too has heavy financial exposure, I think the underlying preferred stocks give it a degree of insulation.  These examples would be choices early on while maximizing returns, but I'd move to lower-yield safer funds once I've accumulated enough to warrant playing a safer game.",90

15-10-14,Short-term corporate bonds (2% ROI) as a great alternative to a savings account (1% ROI),"I needed a place to park a lump sum of cash until 2016 when they will be paid toward federal taxes, and didn't want to keep it sitting in a checking account earning zero. Originally, I had planned to use something like an [Ally.com](http://www.ally.com) savings account, earning risk-free 1% return.

But in July I made the switch over to Vanguard short term corporate bonds ([VSCSX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=1945&amp;FundIntExt=INT); minimum $10K), and really haven't looked back.

Screenshot: [http://i.imgur.com/YTy3b4A.png](http://i.imgur.com/YTy3b4A.png)

As highlighted in the bottom left, this account has consistently delivered 2% in interest (1.98% to be exact) each month since I picked it up in the summer.

Yes, I no longer have FDIC insurance on my funds, and yes, there is interest rate and default risk. But I feel it's worth it considering it doubled my ROI. VSCSX seems just a few clicks up the risk/reward continuum (correct?), a full 1% extra for what I feel to be a negligible increase in risk.

I still have cash earning 1% risk-free over at Ally.com, and suggest this great first option for most people. However, if you feel you could increase the risk-profile for a portion of your short term savings, and can meet the minimum $10K requirement, I highly suggest a short term corporate bond fund like VSCSX (or its ETF alternative $VCSH).

**Edit:** As per /u/MasterCookSwag and /u/Ironic_Coincidence comments below, I've decided to switch this holding to [VMLUX](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0531&amp;FundIntExt=INT) Limited Term Tax Exempt Bonds. Thanks everybody.",1

15-10-14,"$OSK - Recently won initial $6B contract (potentially $30B) with the Army, Lockheed protest decision due 12/17/2015. Ride on the moon with me in blast-proof light tactical vehicles!","Like most people here, I don't believe in looking at things like financials, liabilities, assets, or astrological charts (technical analysis) of companies.  But if I were to look at the numbers of Oshkosh Corporation, a homegrown 'Merican company based in the town of Oshkosh, WI, I'd say they look just fine.  

Here's the company summary: Oshkosh Corporation is a leading manufacturer and marketer of access equipment, specialty vehicles and truck bodies for the primary markets of defense, concrete placement, refuse hauling, access equipment and fire &amp; emergency.

But cloud1131, why do we care about Oshkosh Corporation ($OSK)?  This company's been around for almost 100 years and they look pretty solid.  Go post this garbage in /r/investing.  

WELL, what seems to have fallen out of the news, because /r/WSB subscribers are impatient gamblers who need their catalysts within the next week or 2, is that they just won a $6B contract with the Army that has the potential to be worth up to $30B ($OSK's current market cap is ~$3B and their revenue from last year was about $6B).  This contract would exponentially increase their revenue over the next couple of years. 

But cloud1131, if they already won then why are you telling us just now, isn't it too late?  Thankfully for you it's NOT too late!  Like most government contracts this one has been protested by Lockheed Martin and the GAO was given 100 days to respond (the decision is due by 12/17).  The stock price hasn't really reflected this contract win because it is not final yet.  But most appeals that go to the GAO get denied (I'd give you a statistic, but since most statistics are made up, I'd suggest you just look at the GAO's website yourself if you don't want to take my word on it).  

I expect this stock price to fly to the moon if the protest is denied, but if the protest is upheld and the Army is required to re-evaluate, the stock won't all of a sudden tank because as stated previously this is a solid company.  So this may not feed /r/WSB's need for instant gratification or depression, but between now and 12/17 the GAO will make a decision and the odds are in favor of $OSK right now.

&gt;By most indications, the U.S. economy is quite strong. But that hasn’t stopped a number of “experts” from predicting a future full of doom-and-gloom. The most aggressive of these bearish predictions call for a repeat of the 1929 crash that started the Great Depression. In early 2014, investors passed around a chart that seemed to predict imminent disaster. 

&gt;All of this is, of course, complete nonsense. Any comparisons between 1929 and 2015 are. The economic, monetary, and geopolitical transformations that have taken place during the intervening eight-plus decades have been massive in scope....

&gt;... The Next Crash
&gt;To be clear, today’s stock market isn’t invincible. In fact, there are some pretty good indications that it may be slightly overvalued by historical standards. Corrections and crashes will be a part of the future. But anyone who tries to tell you that one is imminent by invoking the events of 1929 is probably trying to sell you a newsletter. History does repeat itself, but times also change.

&gt;In 2014, sellers using Square’s credit card processor processed $23.8 billion in payments, from which Square gets a cut. This amount was generated by 446 million individual payments from approximately 144 million credit and debit cards. In the 12 months ending June 2015, over two million sellers accepted five or more payments using Square, accounting for approximately 97% of the company’s total payments volume.

15-10-15,DD - RepliCel Life Sciences (OTCQB: REPCF) (TSX.V: RP) -- Long Term,"TL;DR small cap Biotech company in clinical trials developing regenerative treatments for pattern baldness, damaged or aging skin, and chronic tendinosis. THIS IS NOT A DRUG COMPANY. The companies long term future depends primarily on the feasibility of their treatments (obviously), and their short term future depends on their ability to raise capital to fund operations.

THE COMPANY

RepliCel Life Sciences is a Canadian regenerative medicine company focused on developing autologous cell therapies that address conditions linked to a deficit of healthy cells required for normal healing and function.

Products: 

* RCT-01 cell therapy treating chronic tendinosis
* RCS-01 cell therapy treating damaged or aged skin
* RCH-01 cell therapy treating pattern baldness
* RCI cell injection device for clinical delivery

all products are patented

Partnerships: 
&gt; Shiseido (TYO: 4911) has an exclusive license for RCH-01 in certain Asian countries including Japan, China and South Korea. The company is actively engaging potential partners for its other products.

Milestones:
&gt; Management launched a clearly defined  18-month value creation plan in Q1 2015.  The Company is launching multiple clinical trials anticipated in 2015 in addition to Shiseido’s own clinical trial of RCH-01 and the device in late prototype development which includes clinical data from two trials, launch of other trials, execution of other licensing deals, a healthier cash position, CE mark for the RCI injector device, multiple manufacturing improvements, and specific research programs targeting other products and applications.

FINANCIALS 

Note: interim financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. This assumes the company will realize its assets and discharge its obligations in the normal course of operations. The company's ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to generate profitable operations or obtain necessary financings to fund operations

Current Price: (RP:TSX.V $0.35) (REPCF:OTCQB $0.29)
As of June 30, 2015:

* Current Ratio: 2.7
* Weighted average shares outstanding: 53,680,811
* Accumulated defecit: ($18,020,149)
* Total Shareholders' equity: $1,265,519


RISKS:

* negative results from the Company’s clinical trials;
* the effects of government regulation on the Company’s business;
* the viability and marketability of the Company’s technologies;
* the development of superior technology by the Company’s competitors;
* the failure of consumers and the medical community to accept the Company’s technology as safe and effective;
* risks associated with the Company’s ability to obtain and protect rights to its intellectual property;
* risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s ability to raise additional capital; and
* other factors beyond the Company’s control. 

Forward Looking Prospects:

* Chronic tendon injuries resulting from sports-related or occupational overuse is a significant unmet medical need. RCT-01 has advantages over current treatments such as the use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory medication or corticosteroids which are limited in efficacy
* plan to initiate a phase 1 trial for RCS-01 in 2015;
* plan to initiate a phase 2 dose-finding trail for RCH-01 in 2015;
* RCI-02 dermal injector device will have applications in certain other dermatological
procedures and development is expected to be completed in 2015;
* Plans to secure CE mark approval for RCI-02 in 2016;
* plans to out-license products to licensees in the 2015-6;
* belief as to the potential of the Company’s products; 

This is by no means a short term YOLO, but if these treatments work (and Shiseido thinks they do), this company can be a YACHT financier.

It’s almost 15 years since Goldman Sachs coined the term “BRICs” for Brazil, Russia, India and China.

Progress for the countries has been hit and miss, but it’s important to remember that we’re still less than 20% into the 21st century.

Despite experiencing significant turbulence, these markets are still massive, representing 20% of the world economy.

With Brazil and Russia seemingly bottoming out, there may never be a better time to get back onto the BRICs bandwagon.

15-10-16,$BDSI DD -- NASDAQ -- $6.50 (5 Month Play: 70-130%),"**INTRO**


Good evening, morning or g’day to you; wherever you are in the world. Firstly, I apologize for the tardiness of the article, but, there was good reasoning behind my decision. Although BSDI had a high chance of their drug “BUNAVAIL” being approved for a chemical change, I didn’t want to risk an incorrect prediction, possibly interfering with the whole Due-Diligence itself. Other than that. My predictions found within this will be educated to the best of my ability, sourced and true. I am not a “professional trader” but I do have plenty of experience under my belt. 

**THE COMPANY**

BioDelivery Sciences ($BDSI) is a small(ish) pharmaceutical company that specializes in manufacturing medicine for pain management and addiction. BioDelivery Sciences (BDSI or “company”) creates new therapies for unmet medical needs. On May 14th, 2015, BDSI and another pharmaceutical company (“Endo”) released spectacular Phase 3 studies for the drug BELBUCA. Their results showed that BEMA consistently decreased pain scored compared to the placebo effect. This drug is in the works, scheduled for FDA approval during October, 2015 (this was not the drug recently approved). The drug recently approved was the one mentioned earlier. It is not a new medication. Instead it was the chemical structure of the medication being changed for enhancement to patient’s treatment. 
This is only one of their drugs in their product pipeline. In total the company has licenses to produce 2 medications and has 3 others in the works.   
* ONSOLIS (being produced): An opioid for the management is severe pain in cancer patients.   
* BUNAVAIL (being produced): A drug to treat opioid dependence; for patients who are addicted to drugs such as morphine or illegal substances such as heroin.   
* Topical Clonidine Gel (Phase 3 Clinical Development): A gel for diabetes patients to treat specific pain that stems from the condition.   
* BELBUCA (Submitted to the FDA): Again, an opioid to manage pain.   
* Buprenorphine Depot Injection (Formula Development): Much like BUNAVAIL, it’s an extended-release particle for the treatment of opioid addiction.   
During the second quarter of 2015, BDSI earned a mere $833,000 split between their two approved drugs. Their royalty revenues and other revenues were about the same, netting them a total revenue of $1.7million during Q2 2015. Unfortunately, their expenses piled up and they ended up $19.2million in debt by the end of Q2, 2015. 
Their medication; BELBUCA is subject for approval very soon (October 23rd). When the medication is approved (if it is) they are subject to $50million regulatory approval bonus and up to $55million if they meet post-approval thresholds on sales. Their predicted numbers are not available (if someone has them please chime in) but I personally believe we will see strong sales. 
According to my research, opioid addiction is a chronic problem in the USA with over 70% of addicts dying due to their problem. Their patented BEMA slow release technology is going to be incorporated in the drug. Personally, due to the practically un-tapped niche market, I believe it will be a mildly successful drug. Their earnings this quarter and the next should show us their ability to be profitable for the upcoming years. Due to their drugs being on the market and money invested into advertising, there should be a substantial profitability increase, which, BELBUCA will only increase. 


**THE FINANCES**


As of August 7th, 2015, there were 52.5 million shares of Company stock issued and about 10k less shares of common stock outstanding and a float of 48 million shares. 
Nowhere on the 10-Q did it say the number of users any of their drugs had, only the earning it was making. I’m just going to estimate here. According to the sources listed below, BUNAVAIL runs, on average, $240.00 for 30 doses. It’s not covered by medicare, so, we’ll assume they get 30% of the purchase cost. 
Dividing their $833,000 revenue from their two medications in two, from BUNAVAIL alone, the company makes (per quarter) about $417,000. This means they dispense a conservative 5,700 (x30) doses per quarter. Their competition Reckitt Benckiser (RB.L) makes a very similar drug, which, according to my findings is not only cheaper, but more effective. This may mean losses for BDSI in the longer run if they don’t improve BUNAVAIL. Fortunately, they were just granted the ability to improve it, so, hopefully that puts them one step ahead of the competition. 
Unfortunately, neither of their drugs are covered by Medicare, meaning, less sales, although, increased profit percentage. This is bad news for the company, because, as medication prices rise people will default to not only the cheaper alternative, but the alternative Soboxone; covered by Medicare and CareGivers USA. In the meantime (because this is WSB), we won’t worry about it. 
So. I’m predicting some profitability if their next drug gets approved. Not only do they get $50million if it goes through (which will pay off their liabilities) but they have another revenue stream. Their initial marketing costs for their drugs on the market are no longer there and the research and development grants can be collected, while, there are no research and development fees anymore (for the drug BELBUCA). As they start tapping into these revenue streams, it’s not unlikely their valuation will jump to possibly $500m+ where we can see their shares trading at $9-$10. This would be soon after the announcement of BELBUCA that we should see a big jump (because that grant is collected). If we just do the math. The $50million tacked onto their company’s valuation alone could rise the price by $0.30-$0.40. Right now, the company has some pretty hefty liabilities, almost 30% of their assets. These loans were taken out to fund the research of their 3 drugs in development. Hopefully this $30million deficit will be cleared up if the drug is approved and their $90million in total assets can shine through. 


**THE PLAY**


Simple. The hype of their drug approval should die down in the next few days. But don’t let that fool you. I would look for an entry point at about $6.30. This would be optimal, but, getting in at $6.40 means you got a piece of the pie undervalued, so, in theory, no matter what the price should rise. 
Buy and hold to see if it pays out on Q3 ER. As I mentioned before, we should see some increased revenue due to their product base their new and improved BUNAVAIL drug hitting the markets as soon as Friday. If the Q3 ER is good, it can (again, in theory) only get better through to Q4, so hold until then. It’s likely that warrants may be exercised after the Q3 or Q4 ER so it’s strongly recommended you take profit after the respected earnings reports and look for a decent reinvestment price after the respective reports. 
CATALYSTS AND TARGETS
•	FDA approval of BELBUCA (scheduled for October 25th). This brings the company $50,000,000 in earnings (140% of their total debt) and gives them another stream of revenue. $8-9.50/share
•	Q3 ER – Expected increased earnings from BDSI throughout the world as not only has the drug been on the market longer, but it’s seen a bigger user base. It’s possible that we can see the revenue increase from the FDA approved enhanvement of BUNAVAIL and still feel the aftermath of the BELBUCA approval. $8.50-$10.00/share
•	Q4 ER – Expected increase of earnings from BDSI as they have an even bigger user base, may be entering the phase 1 of their clinical trials for Buprenorphine Depot Injection and could collect the threshold rewards for BULBUCA. $11.00-$15.00/share
•	(Remote) Clinical Stages (2 and 3) of Buprenorphine Depot Injection with positive results could see a jump in the share price. Possibly +5% of the share price at the time.
•	(Remote) FDA approval of Clonidine Topical Gel (probably closer than expected, it’s in Phase 3) and Buprenorphine Depot Injection drugs. 


**RISKS**


Although everything has its risks, in relation to everything else, this company is generally safe. They have decent, name-brand drugs in three separate markets, two of which currently generate revenue. Although, please do see the risks listed below. There are many, and yes, this is risky (not as risky as some other picks), but I encourage you to please, read on!
* The FDA stops approving their drugs. For one reason or another they don’t collect the $50,000,000 as the drug isn’t approved or it simply doesn’t work. 
* Patient liability. If something happens that can be attributed to the drug, they’re liable for the cost of the incident. 
* They’re currently being sued by “MonoSol” who claims BDSI’s process of making their drugs (although never disclosed by BDSI) infringes on one of their patents. BDSI has an extremely strong case and is most likely going to win. 
* Again, BDSI has entered another lawsuit created by “MonoSol” who claims BUNAVAIL’s formulation (again, never revealed) infringes on another one of their patents. Yawn.   
* It’s possible they have to immediately repay a $30,000,000 loan they took out in May 2015, meaning they would have (straight from their 10-Q) incur additional indebtedness, inter into a merger, change the nature of their business, make investments, change their organization or even consolidate their holdings!  
* They may be required to delay or limit their production of drugs if they are unable to raise enough money to repay this loan, or, any other loans that they have out.   
* Their competition simply reduced the price of their drug, makes it more effective or somehow undermines BDSI’s version.   
* Revenues don’t improve.   
* Dilution. If warrants or options are exercised before the ER’s or catalysts, we could see a major decrease in the share price. After-all, there’s about 12,000,000 warrants out there. They may also feel the need to raise cash (although unlikely) selling their public or private equities, again, impacting the share price. 

**DISCLOSURE**

I do not have a stake in this company although I may acquire a stake to play their earnings in the future. I am not a professional trader. This post should be the start of your due diligence otherwise my mistakes become your own. This stock may go down. You may lose money. You may lose ALL your money. So make darn sure you know what you’re buying because you are competing with people who do.

15-10-15,"Apple Opens Stock Grants to All Employees, Including Retail","At the crux of Hillary Clinton’s campaign so far this election season has been the idea that in order for the middle class to grow, big businesses need to do more to share their good fortune with the employees who do the hard work day in day out.

Now, it seems Apple agrees.

From now on, all Apple employees, from its top engineers to its retail and AppleCare workers, will be eligible for a stock grant program that was previously only available to Apple’s corporate employees. Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the new program in a company-wide email last night, WIRED has learned. Cook explained that while Apple employees have always been able to buy Apple stock at a discounted rate, until now only corporate employees were eligible to be nominated for restricted stock units, or RSUs, which essentially amount to grants of stock that the company uses as incentives to keep and reward top talent. Now, any employee is eligible. ",3

15-10-15,Return on investment on home purchase,"I modeled ROI on our home purchase with the XIRR function.  

Cash flows in = all money put into the house such as downpayment, mortgage, taxes, improvements, maintenance, etc ...

Cash flows out = the equivalent that would be spent in rent.  I estimated this to be $2500/month in our area (NJ).

Investment value = payout if house was sold today after all closing costs

House was purchased in 2011 for $402K.  Current market value is ~$460K.  Money that was put into the house was 84K in 2011, 36K in 2012, 35K in 2013, 50K in 2014, and 30K in 2015 (so far).  Some other details: 20% down, 2.6% fixed rate 15 yr mortgage, outrageous NJ real estate taxes.  

Assuming 30% discount on mortgage interest and property taxes due to deductions on income taxes and that I can sell the house without an agent, the ROI I am getting is 18%!

The country has an extensive property inventory with prices ranging from a few thousand dollars to several million. So something for everyone, from the small investor to multi-million projects. 

The question is why the apparent lack of interest? Is it lack of knowledge of the country, bad publicity (crime, corruption, etc), better opportunities elsewhere, language (D.R. is Spanish speaking).

Positive and sound advice much appreciated.","I am inheriting 32k from my grandmother. I need advice on the best way to invest/pay off debt and be smart about it. I have student loans that add up to about 48k. One loan is 29,313.75 and the other is 19,386.89 both with an interest of 5.75% each. At this moment with my current salary I am unable to even make the interest accrual payments which is over 300$ a month (I am on ICT plan. Income contingent plan). My loan originally started at 42,000 a year ago so in a year I have accrued about 6k in compounded interest. And obviously goes up each month. I would like to get rid of my student loans but also have money to purchase a car or place a down payment on a house or even invest to make more. I have no knowledge of finance really. I have a 401k with my company and that's about it. I have attached images of my student loan debt. I am wondering if there is a better way so that I can possibly put the money into something else and be able to make money that will pay my student loans off completely and still leave me with money for car, down payment on house, possible better future etc. I have never had a lot of money and I don't want to be dumb about it and will take any sound advice you have.

15-10-16,MNGA officially on uptrend with two major catalysts not factored into PPS.,"All you fucking idiots laugh and laugh and say $MNGA is ponzi scheme. It's hilarious. How are your biotechs doing lately?

Plain and simple, MagneGas is on an uptrend and my investment has gone green. Co-combustion and hog farm testing results are coming by EOY—they are the only reason I'm in this stock. PPS right now is reflective of the reception of their new product, MG2.

Do your DD or just keep laughing. This stock is going to double by EOY—plenty of shorts will be covering at once.

After that, I'm out and over to January 15th $OSK calls.",1
15-10-17,"RXII - Idiots who don't know what a catalyst is, listen up. I'm about to edumacate you.","To those folks out there who still own any kind of significant position in RXII as a result of DD that someone else did for you, allow me to give you some tough love: You're dumb.

That's right. You're dumb, and you should feel bad about your life and the decisions you're making.

""Wow. /u/resumeblank, why would you say such a thing?""

Because, idiot: 99% percent of you learned about RXII from one of two places: JBEM777's DD or /u/pcx99's DD.

Let's see what they had to say about the stock in their DD -

**Jbem777** ""Personal Trading Strategy for this Pick: ...Clinical development has progressed during this period and within the next month, data is expected to be released that will act as an inflection point to drive share price appreciation.""

**/u/pcx99** - This is a PLAY and not an investment. I, personally am looking only to play into the October 21st run-up where I will decide if the run-up exceeds the value I expect to gain after good clinical data. Since this is new data at TWO conferences in a relatively short time-frame I am expecting the data to be good. It makes no real sense to go to ONE investor conference and report bad data from your trials let alone TWO.

------

Both of them make it pretty clear that this was not a long-term hold, but a spec play. Based off of Jbem's DD, it was a spec play based off of a single event: The conference on the 15th. In pcx99's DD, based of two events: the conference on the 15th and the 21st.

So, what happened on the 15th?

Data came out. And the share price didn't even get anywhere close to .80 cents, which was specified in pcx99's DD as a level that he wanted to see before the conference on the 21st.

Now, ask yourself: Why didn't the price rise?

Well, there's only two real reasons:

A. The data wasn't that good.

B. Shorts took control of the stock and sapped investor confidence.

So, which happened? It turns out it was mostly column B. The company bungled their expected PR in the morning, releasing no new numbers or photos, and it caused the stock to take a huge dip, which was only brought back to above .50 levels when the data and the photos were leaked. 

It turned out that the data was good. 68% of people who looked at the scar treated with Rxi-109 thought the scar looked better than just a normal scar. And 68% is good. ""90%+"" would been better, and probably the number that investors needed to confidently send this stock flying, given the huge short interest.

------

So, now what?

Well, according to JBEM's DD, the spec play is over. So, now the only reason you would be holding is because of data on the 21st that pcx99 mentioned in his DD.

Let's take a look at the PR for the conference though: 

http://investors.rxipharma.com/file.aspx?IID=4418218&amp;FID=31356894

Dr. Cauwenbergh will present an update on advancements within the Company's research and development programs.  In addition, he will provide a corporate overview that includes the Company's clinical programs and the multiple business development opportunities available based on RXi's proprietary sd-rxRNA® platform and extensive intellectual property portfolio.  The presentation will be webcast and available on the ""Investors"" section of the Company's website, www.rxipharma.com. 

----

There's no conclusive evidence from this PR that anything new will be presented on the 21st. Rather, the ""update on advances in the company's R&amp;D program"" is likely referring to the data that was presented on the 15th.

In other words, the spec play is done. IT'S OVER. Both Jbem and /u/pcx99 are out of this stock:

Pcx99: It hit my stop today. I'm mostly out. The stop was still a profit (barely, counting all the other times I hit a stop and put back in). But I don't feel comfortable playing RXII forward.


Jbem: I have sold the majority of my position. I continue to hold a core position and am going to let this ride. The biggest trading mistake I have made this year was selling my core positions in AVXL and TPIV, resulting in the missed opportunity of a lifetime x2. I believe RXII has the same potential as these two companies and am comfortable holding this core position over the coming months.

-----

So, basically, you have no other reason to hold unless, as, JBEM says, you're comfortable holding over the coming months. And JBEM can do that easily. He's a millionaire, and he's holding a small position compared with what he sold.

------

In conclusion, the event is done with. Profits were taken, despite them not being nearly as much as people wanted. And unless you truly, truly believe in this company going forward, then why the fuck are you still holding? And if you do truly believe in this company going forward, then why are you complaining about the stock price? /u/pcx99 and /u/theycallme1 have been bagholders of BGMD all the way down to the .30's. But, they don't complain because they believe in the company.

And if you are someone who bought this stock because you read that people on this forum were excited about it, and then when the event didn't pan out, you decided to switch your strategy and become a long-term bag holder, then you're wrong. That's how people lose REAL money, because their conviction eventually goes away when the stock hits a really low point, and it's only then that they sell.

I'll leave you with this - It was taken from $heff's board: http://images.investorshub.advfn.com/images/uploads/2015/2/2/vygyaimage.jpg

Get out of this stock, idiot.

Note: I have nothing to do with this stock. I sold my position on Thursday. I have no plans to buy, short sell this stock, or profit from writing this in any way. Part of being a part of WSB is getting education from more experienced investors. The goal here is to help people who got in over their head here on a stock that they don't understand.

15-10-16,Do you find Colgate-Palmolive interesting as an investment right now?,"Personally i have been using their products for as long as i can remember and its quite a straightforward business, it sells toothpaste (+ brushes) and soap generally speaking. I can't imagine not using their products in the next 10..15..20 years and with a growing world population and more importantly more emerging middle classes the demand for CL's type of products should increase.

CL currently has a P/E ration of 26.7 (morningstar), with a net profit margin of about 13.5% and offering a 2.27% div yield with a payout ratio around 60% . I generally prefer investments with a much lower P/E and CL sits quite a bit above the market average but then again i wouldn't mind paying too hefty of a premium for a healthy company. My expectation isn't for this stock to be outperforming the market but just as a long term dividend grower (more tax advantageous for me)  that has a constant successful business that will grow over several decades.

From what i could find CL has a price target at about 69 and with today's stock price 66.82 thats only a bit over 3% upside which isn't too alluring in my opinion and generally most analyst reports aren't too keen on this one (Morningstar gives it 4 stars though).

I like the company but that doesn't mean it makes for a good investment but is anyone else looking at it right now? Would appreciate hearing your bull/bear case on this stock!",1

15-10-16,Question about Dividend Portfolios with Robo Investing,"Just an FYI, this isn't my first time around the block. I don't need to hear the song and dance about ETFs, market timing, capital appreciation, TVM, opportunity cost, risk management, or anything like that.

I'm looking to benchmark a piece of my dividend growth portfolio with a robo-investing service position. Secondarily, I am also looking to potentially use the dividend income under management to increase my lending power when it comes to purchasing real estate. Apparently after 2008, a lot of underwriters won't accept cash flow from dividends as qualified income towards a mortgage, but they will accept it if it is under management. This makes absolutely no sense to me, but a lot of the guidelines they have put in place since then don't make logical sense and have made purchasing real estate much more troublesome.

So I have two questions here. First, do dividends accrued in a robo investing account automatically get reinvested, or is this credited to your account? My initial findings are showing that dividends paid are not directly credited and everything is reinvested, essentially leaving you with a zero net cash position unless you back out your equity. My second question is whether or not this type of robo-investing option exists. Is there a platform that will allow you to keep dividends as cash rather than re-investing the funds? If so, which platforms allow you to do this?

Thanks in advance. ",5

It is a quantitative investment strategy which I figure might help a bit due to my complete lack of experience.

15-10-17,When to take profits and run...?,"So I put some money into the market when everything went to shit at the end of the summer. Tried to grab some bargains (falling knife...I know).  This was just money to play around with -- and I bought things with the intention of buying and holding --- hence the (attempted) diversification.  That being said, on ""riskier"" stocks, I never know whether to take my profits, sell, and then reinvest those in ""safer"" options.   I guess the real question is, looking at the info below, anyone have any suggested buy/sells for this portfolio?  This is the first time I have ever really invested without the help/guidance of others far more knowledgeable.  Thanks in advance

For example, I consider Twtr to be a ""riskier"" stock.  It makes up 3.5% of the portfolio, but that position is now up 13.2%.  Do I sell and move it into something that is ""safer""?

I consider AAPL to be a ""safer"" stock --- it makes up 15.7% of the portfolio, but that position is only up 1.8% since I bought.

VRX is definitely risky, with large swings back and forth (but, potentially, great upside).  It makes up 10% of the portfolio, and is up 6% since I bought.  I could lose that 6% in a day, or double it in a day.  

Another risky play - Rio - makes up 3.3% of the portfolio, with gains of 12.8%.  

Some of what I consider ""safe"" stocks in the portfolio are JNJ (8.3% of portfolio, up 6.5%), F (4.4%, up 12.5%), GE (2.5%, up 20.7%)

[It's not all rosey --- my BHI position makes up 15% of the portfolio and is down almost 11%, WMT is 6.7% and down 16.2%]


The other positions in the portfolio: CVX 7.77%	up: 17.36%, OPK 5.86%	down -2.33%, PG 4.25% up 9.66%, BABA	4.09% down -18.20%, GLNCY 3.02%	down -9.90%,  JD 2.29% up 3.22%, FCX 1.77%	up 17.16%, CHK 1.19%	down -13.31%

First, I have a very active portfolio right now. I have a mixture of real estate(single and multi), Oil/Gas exposure, minimal stocks(less than 5%), and a small bit of Private equities.

All in all it's done pretty well. Not that EVERYTHING hasn't done well since 2011, (when I started the majority of my investing) but I'm missing one piece to the puzzle.

When my money is not employed, and it's hard to keep money employed at my somewhat picky standards 24/7/365, where do I keep it housed when idle? I need a capital warehouse or sorts that pays better interest than a savings account, but has similar liquidity (30-45 days tops for access to money). Having money idle at near 0% of a saving account while waiting for next opportunity, can lower a great cash on cash return to a pretty mediocre one.

I want a long term vehicle that has short term liquidity basically.

I have a lot of knowledge in the stock market and feel that I could be successful. I am at point now where I can predict a stocks day to day fluctuations with an accuracy rate of about 85%. That is that 85 percent of the trades that I make are gains. Is this high enough? What should I be shooting for before risking any money? I was thinking a 95% accuracy rate, but I'm wondering if that is even possible. Thank you for your answers! ",3

So what is the legal minimum age required before you can invest through a financial service company, such as Hargreaves Lansdown? (Not sure if it would change anything,  but it would be on UK markets as well)

15-10-18,"Alternatives when ETFs aren't an option","Hey there! 
I'm looking to invest more than half of my income every month for the next 10-20 years and I'll start by saying that I have no intention to try and beat the market in general but I do have a high risk tolerance when it makes sense.    
ETFs seem like the obvious choice for my situation but I live in Denmark and ETFs are taxed at a higher rate than individual stocks here and can't be tax harvested so I've been looking at alternatives.  
 I want my investments to be passive in the sense that I won't have to listen to market news and react to them, but I don't mind having to do rebalancing and the like.   
My ideas are:  
- mirror small indexes myself such as DOW30 abs OMXC20, but these seem to have a lower return than broader indexes and I'm not looking to reduce my risk for lower return.   
- Invest a significant portion in berkshire hathaway and possibly other similar holding companies but I'm not entirely sure if I would be paying too high a premium and sacrificing diversity  
- Pick random stocks from indexes of my choice. This would allow me to adjust my risk by choosing e.g. US. small cap indices for higher risk return. I'd be brave enough to do this but I suspect I wouldn't be able to resist ignoring some occasional random picks that are in Industries that I don't believe in, and I'm not sure if that would ruin the concept of not but trying to beat the market.   
- Bite down and try to become a decent value investor even though I don't currently have the spirit for it   

So do you guys have any thoughts on my ideas or any suggestions of your own? What would you do in my situation?",17

15-10-17,Do I do options like a pussy?,"My grandpa taught me a very conservative way of investing. Only buy companies that are well established, pay a dividend, near their 52 week low, low P/E ratio, etc.

He also taught me the way that I trade options: I only sell them and I only sell puts and covered calls. My basis for selling a put is if I won't mind owning the stock at the strike price. I target a stock that I think won't go down, but if it does I won't mind having the stock put to me because I think that it will eventually go up. But I usually just end up pocketing the premium! I also sell calls on stocks that I own. I only sell calls at prices that I'm comfortable getting rid of the stock at. And if the stock doesn't go up then I just pocket the premium!

I just discovered this subreddit and I'm kind of mind blown. I always have wondered who the hell is on the other end of the deal buying my options, and thinking that they are stupid.

15-10-17,How will leveraged muni ETFs will behave with interest rate hikes?,"I have a significant portion of my investments locked in leveraged bonds (BBN, BFZ, NAC, NZH, etc). The tax advantaged NAC, BFZ provide about 6% dividend yield while taxable BBN provides close to 8% dividend yield. All these funds have been consistently paying dividends for the past seven to eight years. Since I have a decent paying job and passive real estate investments, I have gotten bold over the past one year and invested almost all of my savings into these  funds so the stakes are really high for me. While I am doing okay for now, I am concerned what will happen when interest rates go up. Since the noise went up about interest rate hike, prices of these ETFs actually went up which seems counter-intuitive to some extent but probably the leveraging is causing the reverse effect. I don't know. Anyway, I have following specific questions.

* What happens to the prices of these funds when Fed raises interest rates? More importantly what happens to the dividend?
* What happens in the long term when Fed continues to raise interest rates over the next couple of years?  Both to the price and dividend.

Note that I don't mind price volatility as long as dividends are consistent and price has the potential to come back to current levels over the next decade or so. ",1

15-10-17,New to investing -- looking for opinions regarding strategy so far,"I'm only investing a few thousand dollars at the moment but I'm adding roughly $1,000 a month. My approach this far has been buying stocks that pay nice dividends. I'm 25, make pretty good money but also have a family and recently bought a house. My goal is to get a nice passive income until I have enough to invest in real estate for a rental property (and eventually a second rental property, and then a third, and so on). I started putting money on lendingclub but once I hit $500 and realized it's not even remotely liquid, I decided to quit (despite the 7% return I'm seeing).

I've been choosing stocks and averaging down any time there's a drop off. I started in June, so I've seen a few already. Typically I leave enough free cash to significantly lower my average price in such a scenario. I'm using RobinHood so as soon as I hit my break even point (usually I go slightly above it) I sell the extra shares I didn't intend on having. This strategy is working so far, I'm up 6.56% since June.

I keep some money in stocks that have decent movement and I can keep averaging down (Sprint for example) despite them not being a part of my main goal.. I rode it from $4 to $5 a month or so ago and now I'm back in at $4.11. 

Anyways, back to my question. My portfolio is currently heavily dividends and I'm expecting &gt;10% yield which seems... to easy? I don't know so I want more opinions. I have a decent amount in PSEC (125 shares at $7.35), ARP (200 shares at $2.94), DX (50 shares at $6.64), F (50 shares at $13.96 -- this one I'm not worried about at all, I don't anticipate them going anywhere in the next few decades and their dividend isn't insane). My main concerns are with DX, PSEC, and ARP. PSEC has a very long history of paying but their dividend is $1/yr and their EPS is $0.98 which doesn't seem sustainable. DX is worse in that regard, $0.96/yr dividend and $0.85 EPS. ARP actually has a very negative EPS but still pays the monthly dividend. Granted, ARP is such a high yield because they took a beating with the oil crashing but still. I was worried about ARP at first but I started with a few shares and kept adding every month because they keep announcing the same dividend payment each month. PSEC announces their dividends in batches so I wasn't as concerned with them. DX I've been buying/selling pretty much every time they announce a dividend and have been riding the waves.

[Quick Edit] I feel like I should mention I've been putting 4% of my salary at a 100% employer match in my 401k for the past 2 years. I started with a traditional ira but now I have a roth account. Can I get some tips on which of these is better. My thought was that I'm in a lower tax bracket at the moment than I plan to be when I retire so I may as well pay the taxes at these rates and I'll be better off when I retire (there's an argument for missed capital gains if I was deferring the taxes and had more of a balance in there, I know).",3

15-10-17,Roth IRA VS. Regular IRA,"It seems like a roth ira would be better to open at a young age rather than a regular. is this true?
my reasoning if you have a roth IRA you don't lose taxes when you take out money but regular you would. 
so for example if you put 5500 in at an age of 20 and waited till 60+ to take it out it would be worth ~40k if you average 5% return a year
while you don't get taxed on the money putting into a regular you would end up paying tax when you take it out meaning that the ~40k you would be taxed on rather than the 5500.
is this correct or am i thinking about this wrong?
TLDR; wouldn't be better to open a roth and not be taxed when its worth more rather then not paying tax when you first deposit your money",98

15-10-18,HELP!!! My mother is about to put her 401k into a fixed index annuity!,"I don't know whether to post it here or on personalfinance. So, I'm doing both.

Here's the story:

My mother recently retired. She has approximately $500k in her 401k and receives two pensions. My mother can live off the pensions for the rest of her life, as her expenses are low. She intends to pass down her 401k to her children. She is very concerned about losing any of the 401k money. She spoke with a couple of financial advisors, and landed on one who seemed the best out of the bunch. Because of her aversion to risk, he suggested a fixed index annuity. I'm very concerned about her putting the money in an annuity given the surrender charge, no step up in basis for heirs, higher annual fees, and other taxes and fess.

We are both at a loss as to where she should put her money given her risk aversion. What kind of investment products should my mom look into? Should she just put into a mix of mostly bonds and a few ETFs/mutual funds? Any suggestions you can provide would be much appreciated because we are at a loss.",8

But following one of his YOLOs has led me to a strategy that has done well.","My friend can't be bothered with anything more than SMA.   and thinks ""averaging down"" means when a trade is going against him, he just needs to double down.  Problem is he does this on short term options (&lt; 2 weeks) and has gotten blown up time and again.  His latest crusade is to be right about a market crash. I tell him to try something different, but he is so sure about a crash, that any thing that happens opposite is just ""reeling in more suckers"".

But the point is not to gossip about my friend who is an idiot, but about the fool that followed him(me), and finally to my new strategy.

At one point, he was buying strangles on short term options  (like &lt; 1 week) for stocks having earnings calls.   i stupidly followed him into a strangle on TSLA for thursday after close earnings (expiring friday).   He picked a nice wide range for the strangle, which looking at past tSLA earnings, it has never really moved 10%  in either direction (not that it wouldn't, but ...the rationale for buying was it was cheap and we could get a lot).

needless to say that was 2500$ down the drain.   Then he tried to tell me to do the netflix or linkedin strangles the following week i didn't, he did.  -4000$ for him.  

Then it got me thinking,  who the fuck is selling us these and how much are they laughing at us.

Since then , i have been monitoring earnings days,  and looking for short term strangles to sell.    And it has worked out really nicely.  Even through that August crash....   if it expires withing the strangle, GREAT, 100% profit.   If it goes past the strangle... i just roll that leg of the short and so far they have all come back....

This giant pile of turd needs to be nurtured until it grows to a giant shit tree.  The company is Emeco and it is fucked.  That's why it is interesting.

Pitch:

Emeco rents giant mining dump trucks to the rednecks in Australia, Canada, and Chile.  Iron ore and coal have gotten skullfucked by China slowing so the market destroyed this stock (-96% since 2011).  The reason it is interesting is because the market is expecting for this company to go BK like those bitches in Greece.  If it does or they sell their assets (mainly mining equipment like dump trucks and dozers - real shit you can sell) at a 70% discount, you make your money back.  If they sell it near book value like they have been doing recently, upside is 7.5x (that's 650% gainz, motherfuckers).  If they survive and start making money again, we're going to 1000% and making Clinton moist in the process.

Are there any caveats to this? My wealthfront portfolio has performed on par with my other investments , but fares much better when including the 5% lift from harvesting. Is there anything I am missing here before moving more funds over?

I'm under 40 and quite a ways off from retirement, if that matters.  I picked Voya (ING at the time) when I got hired back when I didn't care.  I haven't had any complaints with them perse, but as I've become more interested in investing over the last year (still a noob though) I'm wondering if I'm missing out on a better investment firm.  

Any opinions/feedback would be appreciated. 

Thanks.

15-10-19,Join /r/stocks traders and investors in our redesigned chat room with new optional features like mobile apps and voice chat!,"This past weekend I was introduced to an excellent chat platform that provides many of the features you guys have been asking for. The UI is fantastic; there are apps for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android (and I hear if you guys convince them that there are more than 20 Windows Phone owners in the world, they may make an app for you!); and there's even *optional* voice chat if you'd like to yell and shout about how much money you're making.

#[Come visit the chat and say hi!](http://www.r-stocks.com/chat/)

**As usual, the chat is *always* open for people to ask questions, receive advice, announce their trades, and whatever makes your portfolio green. Traders and investors all welcome.**

Overall it should be a much better experience for everyone since I know some people were having issues with the mobile version of the chat (and now you get a whole damn app), the UI was severely lacking (and most of you didn't even see how atrocious it looked before I redesigned it - \*shudders*), and it was just generally clunky.

15-10-20,$NECA - My Profound Thoughts About a Go Broke or Make 100% Situation.,"Morning!

First, let me say: I have absolutely no stake in ""$NECA"" although it's a looming (high) possibility I will take a small one out to play some price swings. 

Okay. $NECA. Let's talk about it. It's an exploration stage company. The Company's principal business is the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources. The Company has not generated any revenues. It's wholly owned subsidiary is Title King, LLC, a Georgia-based company. 

The problem with this stock is their entire operation lives on an itsy-bitsy loan provided, by, essentially a loan shark. The thing here is the loan is $1.5million, pretty much nothing when you look at the profit of these huge loan sharks.

Here's the fact: NECA has bottomed out and it's NOT going any lower then $0.0003 (unless it goes bankrupt). 

It's currently negotiating another loan to continue exploration and all the PR points towards the approval of the loan because it's pretty much the only way the loan sharks are going to get their coin back. 

Here's the play: Buy in right now. ASAP. The loan approval can go through any second. I'd say $0.0003 is the bottom price. When the loan is approved (highly likely) we will see the $0.0006-$0.0014 prices we saw before. 

If the loan isn't approved, odd's are the company is going under and you'll loose a chunk of money. 

This is WSB right? Here's a true YOLO for you all to consider.

I'm comfortable holding it for a while as I know the policy needs to be in place for the action to start but I was surprised and how quickly it fell from the first gate.  Was this a normal trend in stocks? I'm pretty new about this and looking for some insight or analysis.  ",3

15-10-20,Looking for some input,"So I got 2,300 shares in AMDA and have lost about half the value in the past month. I've got $364 in MNGA with $72 in gains and another $260 in CYCC with $32 in gains. So about $620 in equity between the two.

Should I cash out MNGA and CYCC and double down on AMDA or let it ride where it is? I feel like it's all a massive gamble but it's fun.

MNGA is growing and I feel like doing well and will keep going up. CYCC has a clinical drug pipeline that could be big.

15-10-20,EMC-Dell Merger,"So I have read that Dell is going to buy EMC and give EMC shareholders $24 and .11 of a VMware tracking stock(and some guess online said the tracking stock could sell for 5-10% less than the common stock). EMC is currently selling for 27.50 meaning if you buy now you will paying about 3.50 for something which is currently worth 6.73 (7.48*.9). VMware has been doing pretty good and probably overreacted to the news of possible dilution so I think it would be fair to assume the value would stay the same. 

I am just curious why the value of EMC stock has not gone up to meet the value of the VMware stocks. I understand that the deal could fall apart due to the decrease in value of VMware stock and increase in value of EMC stock making it seem like Dell isn't offering enough but wouldn't that just make it more likely that dell would make a slightly better deal or someone else might offer a better deal instead of the deal collapsing? It seems like the value of EMC stock should be at least 24+Value of .11VMware Stock and possibly a little more for possible better offers.",3

15-10-20,"Trying to understand some basic concepts here: why is there a relationship between a company's performance and their stock price?","I'm trying to wrap my head around the fundamentals of how the whole market works.  Here's what I have so far:

- A company wants to raise money.  One way is to break their ownership up into a bunch of shares, and sell them to everyone during an IPO.
- Why do people buy these shares?  I know it is because they feel like the value of them will go up.  But why?  It's because they believe the company will be successful.  But why does that success translate into increasing share value?  The price is just how much others are willing to pay for, so what's changing that?  
- What is a company's incentive for caring about the performance of their stock price?  The company isn't making any money off selling any more stock, is it?  It doesn't matter what the price is, the shares are just sold among other people.  I guess some employees have their own stock in the company, so they are incentivized to do well.  But is that it?
- If a company's stock price plummets to nothing, how does that affect anything?  Their company has all the same assets and can operate the same as they could before.  I'm sure it spells doom, but why?

I guess stocks with dividends make sense, but not all of them have it.  What's the driving force behind everything?  I mean it seems intuitive at first glance that ""successful company = more valuable shares,"" but why?

Apple launched Apple Music on June 30 and offered every user a three-month trial period. After the trial period, users pay $9.99 a month for individual subscriptions or $14.99 for families. The first batch of customers came off the trial period at the end of September.

In August, Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue, who is overseeing the rollout of Apple Music, said it had 11 million people on the trial version of the service. That suggests that nearly 60% of those users agreed to pay for the service after the trial period ended.

By comparison, Spotify AB, which launched in 2008, says it has 75 million active users and 20 million subscribers.

I'm hearing opinions all over the place on this one.  Do you expect the price to be supported by the scarcity and increase in value or is this something that is over-hyped?  Over the past two years the company has reported that its profitability was at its highest level despite selling fewer cars than the previous years.  Their growth strategy seems to focus on expanding into the emerging markets and not selling more cars into the current markets it operates in.  Lastly, the very small float will likely make this stock volatile, in combination with the current economic conditions.. this should be an interesting ride.

15-10-21,Why does the federal reserve use temporary repurchase agreements to control the interest rate instead of simply purchasing treasuries outright like it does with QE?,"I am starting to really understand the federal reserve system but I have a few more things that I really want to understand and one of them is why does the Federal reserve use temporary repo loans to add liquidity into the banking system in order to reduce interest rates instead of directly buying treasuries outright like it does during QE.

I understand that the federal reserve is able to influence the intraday banking interest rates (fed funds rate) by purchasing treasuries from it's primary dealers. This in turn helps with liquidity requirements and so the banks don't need to borrow and hence their reserve requirements are mostly met. 

Why does it need to use a repo which means that the liquidity will be drained out of the system a couple of weeks later? 

Is it because it is a temporary measure and the banks can't just go playing with the money because the money is owed back to the central bank?

If that is the case then why do private banks even partake in the repos? What is in it for them? Why would they bother selling their treasuries since they are income producing assets to the bank?

&gt;&gt;Your target Personal Capital strategy is forecasted to generate a return of 9.4%, compared to your current portfolio's 9.6% return, meaning you could earn more money to use for retirement and other goals. As different asset classes grow at different rates, we'll rebalance it automatically to keep it on target.

15-10-21,The Tesla Double Standard,"Consumer Reports has retracted its buy recommendation for the Tesla Model S over reliability issues.Tesla stock has nosedived since the news was released and is down close to 7%. You've heard this all.

After surveying 1,400 Model S owners, Consumer Reports downgraded the Model S's reliability to ""worse-than-average"" based on customer complaints.

The concerns are valid, but the reaction to the news represents a double standard. Every automotive brand has reliability issues, and most of these brands have been in business for decades. Tesla has less than ten years of experience in building vehicles and has only experienced widespread release of two models with the Model X ramp up ongoing. Reliability is created when 1) a company cares enough and 2) a company has the knowledge and experience to minimize defects. 

I think the latter is the likely culprit for the issues we are seeing in the aging Model S vehicles.

Tesla also has the unique advantage of being able to fix software bugs, which are the cause of most issues, with a software patch applied to all cars without any need for the vehicle to be brought in for inspection. And if there is a hardware problem? Consumer Reports also found that Tesla owners rate the company's customer service among the best in the world.

There is also a very important statistic to note. While yes, the Model S is having reliability issues and yes, this will hurt the brand's image, 97% of Tesla Model S owners that were surveyed said that they would buy the car again.

So it's not that bad, stay bullish.

15-10-21,Making quick trades in low volume stocks (and a couple of other questions),"Hello, trading newbie here.

I was keeping an eye on company reporting today (ASX) and I noticed, for example, that SUL.AX made a 4.4% gain based on a report today that stated they were currently making x% profit increases etc, etc. The report was largely indiciating short term positives.

https://au.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=SUL.AX

Now I have seen reports like this for other companies many times before and I have noticed that higher volumes of trading often start before the news hits official channels. Is this a sign of insider trading? Why does this happen, sometimes the trading volumes increase significantly before it becomes public knowledge? How do so many people know in advance?

Anyway, in this case the share price started to rise about 20mins after the report got released. I might have been interested taking a day trade on this but the daily volumes for this stock are quite low. Hence my main question.

If I want to buy and off load an arbitrary number of shares in a day trade how do I calculate how many I can safely buy/sell quickly? Trading volumes on this stock are quite low but the market cap means that it's a medium sized company in ASX standards. Is it always easier to purchase the quantity of shares you want the larger the cap but not necessarily easier to sell if the trading volumes are low?

Thanks in advance.

I think, even though redundant, it's ok to post this periodically as new apps are constantly releasing and there may be a great one that slipped under the radar and now it can be recognized. So don't downvote me and refer me to the sidebar.

I would like an app that tracks my portfolio in real time and takes in the gains/losses from shares that I've sold, so there's an overall gains/losses, not just for my current holdings. Of course stock apps do this, but if I sold all the shares of a stock, they usually don't let me enter a sell transaction, but rather just delete the stock. I want this accounted for in my total investments calculation. I would like a simple, at a glance and clean look, without having to go through a bunch of steps just to get this number.

*Facts*:

* **My Brokerage Accounts**: Robinhood and TD Ameritrade
* **Platform(s)**: iOS, but would like a web-based platform to enter transactions if it doesn't link accounts

*Feature Requests*:

* Enter a sell transaction without deleting the stock
* Exhibits a breakdown of the portfolio total, including: 
 * Amount invested
 * Current market value
 * Realized/unrealized gains/losses
 * Dividends
 * Commissions
 * Blends multiple brokerage accounts together, but an option to view separately or view each stock
* If it isn't free, it costs a one time payment under $15
* Appealing UI

*iOS/Web Apps Used, Plus Critiques*:

* **TD Ameritrade**: Too broker-centric
* **Robinhood**: Also, too broker-centric
* **ThinkOrSwim**: Also, too broker-centric; Too much info - Great for TA, but not good for investments at a glance
* **Google Finance**: Great, but no mobile website (that I've found) or iOS app; Awesome that most apps allow you to import from it
* **Portfolio**: (there are a couple with this name, but it's has the slate blue icon with a strikethrough diamond in white outline on it) Also great, allows you to enter sells, but I haven't figured out where to edit those or where that info shows up other than showing that you now have zero shares; Nice UI, Notifications about stocks in watchlist
* **Wikinvest**: I don't remember much about it other than the UI had an iOS 1.0 look to it; Won't let me log in and unsearchable on app store leading me to believe it doesn't exist anymore
* **Seeking Alpha**: No Total, too news-centric
* **Personal Capital**: (sigh) If only this would factor in the sell transactions....it has the ability to record them, but doesn't count them at this time :-/
* **StockTracker (free)**: Not too much experience with this one; Seems promising, but horrible UI; Would've bit the bullet and purchased the $14.99 paid version if the UI didn't look terrible

There have been a few more that I've downloaded and briefly used, but they didn't leave an impression on me. I have also been using an excel portfolio tracker that is probably the best at all of this, but it feels so last century and I wish there was something a little bit more automated.

PLEASE let me know if you know of an app that would be useful for me. It sounds crazy, but I've been putting transactions into several places hoping one of them would either update, or just somehow end up working out for me, but none have. Thank you!",5

In a letter posted on his web site, Icahn said he'll take particular aim at corporate inversions, which are merger deals with a foreign company to switch the taxable domicile. Icahn says international tax reform would prevent further inversions, and he proposed a repatriation tax on the order of 5% to 10% that would also fund a highway infrastructure bill.

15-10-21,Did we see blatant market manipulation yesterday with Tesla stocks?,"I've been watching Tesla stock for the past 2 days including some of today. At the same time, I was eyeing all of the boards discussing Tesla stock. I consider myself a rationalist, and the degree of irrational discussion included name-calling, blatant and disreputable insults being thrown about astounded me. Who would have thought that some guy HATED some other guy so much? Why do these people care so much about the guys that bought Tesla at 240 and 250? What reason could they possibly have to call them idiots (or worse?) Sure, the fanboyism from Tesla fans can be astounding, but I don't think that's a reason for me to call the Tesla owners shitbags or dimwits.

But that's tangential.

I was studying the nature of short selling and the effect it can have on market values due to the questions of the behavioural patterns behind the tesla values. I'm going to take a much closer look at the short recommenders that have been putting their names out there for the past 3 days.

Cramer said a few interesting things in this youtube video I located (sorry for the quality):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOS8QgAQO-k
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cramer

Coincidentally, I read this article (www.smithonstocks.com/illegal-naked-short-selling-appears-to-lie-at-the-heart-of-an-extensive-stock-manipulation-scheme/) from June of 2015 from Smithon Stocks about market manipulation.

So I came to the question of whether or not Tesla has been manipulated. Is this at all legal? I'll probably do more research later today on what happened.

If this isn't manipulation, what was the most important reason that the value dropped so much?
If this is manipulation, who did it?

I really hope this doesn't get downvoted because I'd really like to see some serious discussion on this topic.

_____

Also, I'm a bit biased towards Tesla. I am trying to be neutral in my approach to this, however. I'm just trying to satiate my growing curiosity.

EDIT: So yeah, thread's gonna get buried...

Mobile ads are like 37% of Google's revenues. Ad blocking affects said revenues, but this is more of a problem for the ad buyers, who directly pay Google. Google pays ad blockers to let their ads through.

I'm thinking in the worst case, Google's overhead costs simply are going up. Not that there is currently any material impact to the viability of their ads, or a change in sentiment yet amongst ad buyers (everyone else).

Anyway, none of this is positive for Google, as any minor blip in their mobile ad business will drastically affect their stock price.

15-10-22,Popcorn Time! Netflix (NFLX) Just Lost A Major Competitor.,"You see, there's this thing called ""Popcorn Time"". Popcorn Time is an app that's available for PCs and Android smartphones, and which is kind of a Netflix on steroids. It has every kind of TV show imaginable, along with a massive selection of streaming movies, including many recent blockbusters. Popcorn Time relies on bittorrent sharing to provide an experience much like Netflix's, but without having to host massive amounts of data or needing a content delivery network.

Unlike most bittorrent clients, Popcorn Time is as user-friendly as Netflix - you just search for a movie you want to see and press play. After a bit of buffering, Popcorn Time streams your movie just like Netflix. And Popcorn Time is also free, which kind of makes it very competitive with Netflix. Finally, Popcorn Time is illegal in most places since it's basically piracy as the content authors receive no compensation for its usage.
So why am I saying that Netflix just got good news? Well, as it turns out, there was quite a bit of disagreement within the Popcorn Time team regarding the direction they wanted to take it in. Some of this disagreement no doubt was prompted by rumors of an impending large lawsuit against Popcorn Time and those behind it.

This disagreement led to the defections of a large number (5 members) of developers yesterday. And as of yesterday, Popcorn Time stopped working (this happened because the developer holding the keys to the domain was one of those who left). What this means is that overnight, Netflix lost perhaps its largest competitor ever!

The streaming giant NFLX continues its push to become a force in original and exclusive content while also fulfilling a 200-country expansion plan by the end of 2016. Netflix needs money, which means borrowing money.

The company said last week it needs at least $1 billion in the next 12 to 18 months to continue funding its aggressive plans.

Apparently has a deal with deal where DELL will give shareholders $24.05 and .11111111 of a VMWare trailing share which is apperently a share that doesnt really do anything except have value. It can't vote or get dividends or anything like that. tbh idk why it has value but according to some article online it should be worth about 10% less than the real stock. 

So at 25.80 you would be paying 1.75 for .11 of a vmware stock. Vmware is currently worth 54.80 so you would get something worth ((54.80/9)*.90)= 5.48 (assuming the market stays the same which we all know it wont and the deal goes through which it might not) and youd get 29.53 and 3.73 of gains i.e 14% but seriously why the fuck is vmware so low like it had a good earnings report and it sank 20%? wtf? you know that its gonna go back up and youll probably get like 6.00 worth of their wierd ass stock per share so even more gainzzzzz.


Of course this deal might not go through because itll be cancelled because one side is liike ""fuck you bitches"" or some government group might cancel and if it did go through you probably wont get your shit until like 6 months and the amount of time your money is tied up you could have been a billionaire but yah know its a thing at least i guess.


Edit: Also btw the only way you could lose money here is if vmware became worth like $18 which is pretty unlikely as theyre not a terrible company. or if the deal fails. ",2

Further, their advanced financial statement PR ahead of their Q3 ER showed that revenue for Q3 actually declined a few million over the disastrous Q2 ER that started their decline.

There is still an outside chance of redemption in Q4, but given falling revenues, 66m in debt, and now the details of that debt blacked out the risk of playing this into Q4 is unacceptable.

While some people did make money off this DD (that NASDAQ warning) by shorting the stock, I am still marking this failed and closing it.  If you visit the DD I have edited it to show that failure.

Protalix BioTherapeutics, Inc. (NYSE MKT:PLX) (TASE:PLX), announced today positive long term data from the 0.2mg, or lowest dose, of the Company's phase I/II dose ranging clinical trial of PRX-102 for the treatment of Fabry disease. PRX-102 is a recombinant plant cell expressed, chemically modified version of the human alpha-Galactosidase-A enzyme.

""We continue to see excellent results from PRX-102 and are very pleased with what we see in our lowest dose of the study,"" said Moshe Manor, Protalix's President and Chief Executive officer. ""Now that we have viewed results from 12 months of the study, we believe that PRX-102 has a significant potential to improve the condition of Fabry patients, particularly compared to the currently available enzyme replacement therapies.""

The phase I/II clinical trial of PRX-102 for the treatment of Fabry disease is an open-label, dose-ranging study treating up to 18 naïve male and female patients. The three dose cohorts include dosage groups of 0.2 mg/kg, 1mg/kg and 2mg/kg with intravenous infusions of PRX-102 every two weeks. The data presented herein is from patients in the 0.2mg/kg dose group following 12 months of treatment.

""The results to date from the 12 month interim report of the 0.2mg/kg of the Phase I/II clinical trial are promising on both efficacy and safety,"" commented Prof. David G Warnock, Professor of Nephrology at UAB Hospital, Birmingham, Alabama, USA, and a member of the Medical Advisory Board for PRX-102. ""I am looking forward for the further development of PRX-102 that could potentially be beneficial to the Fabry patients' community.""

15-10-22,Need Some Wells Fargo 403b Retirement Assistance,"Currently 30 and planning on retiring at age 55, been working since 15 and my SS points (if SS is around in the next 25 Years) is almost maxed in the next 5-7 years of me working. Have 1 rental property so pretty much want ot know if I did my selections/elections correctly for my target date:

15-10-23,"Example of an option with AT&amp;T Call. Am I seeing this right?","Okay so I just went through the options tutorial on Investopedia.com and I wanted to know if I am interpreting this correctly (I have never traded options):

Hypothetically, lets say I want to buy some calls. I have reason to believe that AT&amp;T (Ticker ""T) will not fall below $32 a share by November 6, 2015. My reasoning is I have watched this stock for a while now and it isn't very volatile and has a long history of trading sideways. AT&amp;T also recently posted good earnings and beat expectations so we can at least expect it not to fall below the price it was it pre-earnings ($32.50-$33 range)

Therefore, I purchase one call option contract of AT&amp;T. The symbol is http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=T151106C00032000.

The option is open for $1.55 so if I buy one contract this is actually worth $155 because a contract represents $100 shares. ($1.55 x 100). This is not counting commissions. This $155 is called the ""premium.""

So November 6 rolls around and AT&amp;T trades completely sideways for the next week and closes at $33.96 a share. Because my call was above the strike price of $32, I now have the right to purchase 100 shares at $32. So I exercise the option and receive 100 shares of AT&amp;T for a total value of $3,200. 

I decide to sell my 100 shares on the next trading day (a Monday) for $33.96 and receive $3,396 not counting commissions. However if I subtract the prior premium of $155 my value was $3,241.

Overall my profit was $41 ($3,241-$3,200) not counting commissions. Lets say commissions would have been around $20. ($10 for buying and $10 for selling). 

My final profit would be $21. A very conservative investment?

EDIT: Fixed my math I thought 100*1.55 was $115 for some reason doh. ",1

&gt;Dear Partner:
&gt;The Greenlight Capital funds (the “Partnerships”) returned (14.3)%,1 net of fees and expenses, in the third quarter of 2015, bringing the year-to-date net return to (17.1)%. During the third quarter, the S&amp;P 500 index returned (8.2)%, bringing the index’s year-to-date return to (5.3)%.

&gt;Given our results this quarter, this is a good time to discuss our process. First, we are value investors. This means that we buy what we believe are misunderstood companies at low valuations relative to their underlying assets and future cash flows. This involves spending many hours analyzing a company’s reported financial statements, then making adjustments to them based on our perception of the economics of the business.

&gt;Sometimes we determine that a listed or perceived asset is actually a liability; other times we find value that gets missed because the company has done a poor job explaining itself. We find that the more misunderstood a company is, the greater the likelihood of a dislocation between value and price, and the more we tend to like it.

&gt;Second, we run a concentrated portfolio. Our philosophy is to invest the most capital in ideas where we have the most conviction. The core of our process for both finding stocks and sizing our investments has not changed and has historically served us well.

&gt;Unfortunately, a good process does not prevent mistakes, nor does it guarantee good outcomes, especially on a short-term basis. Because we look for investments that have a healthy margin for error, a misjudgment of analysis is rarely a disaster. We don’t need much to go right in order to make money, and in many cases we can get a lot wrong and still break even. When we are very wrong, however, we are going to lose money. And although large losses don’t occur often, in a punitive environment we can have more than one in a short period of time.

&gt;With any large loss, we reassess the position to evaluate whether our thesis is busted or the losses are overblown. Depending on what we determine, we either add, hold, trim or exit. Sometimes, patience is in order and sometimes it’s not. Just as the summer began, we ran into significant problems in rapid succession in three of our largest positions. One has played itself out; the other two are still in their middle innings.",1

Investors should be concerned that an investigation could distract management for years to come and potentially result in expensive fines.
The cost of defending against a federal investigation will weigh down earnings, distract management and cause public outcry. In the light of a presidential campaign, the intense media attention should be taken seriously.

Sources I have found say legislation comes into law 60-90 days after being published in the Federal Register. These deadlines have passed for Title IV. However, if you see in the Federal Register link above, it notes the ""Final action"" will be in October 2015. 

So, when does it actually become a law? Is it a law now and I can start investing in startups since the 90 days have passed? Or do I need to wait for the final action? Or do I need to wait 60-90 days after the final action? 
Places like Angel List and Crowdfunder are still requiring proof of being an accredited investor, so I assume it is not yet in effect (or they haven't updated their sites).  ",2

Amazon is at an all-time high. After reporting an unexpected profit on Thursday night, the stock was trading near $600 Friday morning.
This a marked contrast with Walmart.
Earlier this month, Walmart CEO Doug McMillon gave a sort of downbeat assessment of the US economy in an interview on CNBC, saying the economy is ""steady"" and ""OK.""

b) If Alphabet disappoints, Facebook stock rises on the assumption that Facebook's ad platform is stealing market share away from Alphabet.

Then Facebook tends to sell off after it reports its own earnings, because its stock has been run up so much in preceding weeks.

15-10-23,Index funds with large capital gains exposure - what are the alternatives?,"I was reading Joshua Kennon (value investor / blogger), and he mentioned in the comments on[ this blog post](http://www.joshuakennon.com/mail-bag-buying-stock-when-valuations-are-high/) about how some index funds (such as Vanguard's VTSAX) have large built in capital gains (26% according to [Morningstar](https://performance.morningstar.com/fund/tax-analysis.action?t=VTSAX&amp;region=usa&amp;culture=en_US)) which could cause a taxable event if there are large outflows. I don't completely understand this, but I think it's due to IRS rules that make it possible you could have to pay for someone else's capital gains.

This is only an issue for taxable investments, so in your IRA you're fine.

Questions:

1) Is anyone else concerned about this? I suppose it's only a problem if Vanguard has to sell a lot of stock shares, say if Vanguard becomes unpopular and people move their money elsewhere. But it could happen.

2) What are some alternatives without this risk for taxable accounts? I assume other index funds have similar problems. What are you supposed to do if you want a mostly passive portfolio in your taxable account? Maybe make an ""index"" yourself by holding a large number of individual stocks? Seems like a lot of work, but maybe something like Wealthfront's ""direct indexing"" could help here.",3

I'm above the threshold to be able to contribute to a normal deductible IRA, so I'm considering halting contributions to the Roth 401K and opening a normal one (we're able to have both where I work).  Following that, I would open a Roth IRA and fund that up to the maximum allowable amount.  If I did this, I would preferentially fund the Roth IRA over the Roth 401K since the tax implications look the same, however there is much more flexibility in what I can invest in.

I think this is the only possible way in which I can fund both a deductible and non-deductible retirement account at this point, so my question is - does this make sense?  I'll probably be talking to an accountant as well, but I figured it can't hurt to get opinions.  ",2

15-10-25,(Early Macro Monday) Blackbox trading and the moment the global market vanished.,"**Warning: There's a bit of conjecture involved in this topic.**                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                        
'Blackbox' trading, or Algorithmic trading is one of the least well understood and largest facets of, in particular, the FOREX market. HFT (high-frequency trading) accounts for a staggering 70% of all orders executed. Many of these orders sit at the other end of CFD platforms, they exist to take up the other end of the trade and levee a tiny commission.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
As you should know, the currency market is by far the most traded, the top pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY are pushed back and forth in high volume on the  floors of Goldman, J.P. Morgan and Citi (to name a few) and move billions in this market, part of the essential function of keeping currencies liquid. 
What many don't realise is this system is probably the most pervasive in the modern financial market. Lets look at a quick hierarchy of how firms interact with buysiders and where the algorithms (and Quants) fit.
                                                                                                                 
    Top dogs: The big 10 banks. GS, MS, Citi and the others are the alpha predators.                                                                           
                                                                           
    Exchanges: NYSE, NASDAQ, JEG. The exchanges are a gateway between the groups. The feeding ground.                                                                            
                                                                           
    Quants: These are the firms which develop and run the algorithms                                                                           
                                                                           
    Buysiders: Vanguard, Pension funds, superannuation funds. This group is the lunch.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
    Independent traders: Generally options day traders of CFD users. Lower than an amoeba in the chain.                                                                           

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
The algorithms mediate the other end of each trade, the best way to picture this ecosystem is as an aquatic food chain. Make no mistake, the buyside cap management investors (Pen funds, Vanguard, etc) are the defenseless free lunch. Every trade they place gets slapped with multiple commission cuts: Broker fees, other-side fees (taken by the algorithm for holding a position in the intermediary time between the sell and the buy) then on the reverse trade. For those who don't understand how this works exactly: Inst. traders trade in large volume over the phone to inst. brokers. The brokers buy/sell and take a commission, the Quants take another commission. Then when the market makes a move the brokers take another commission, as do the Quants. 
                                                                                                                                                           
It gets interesting when you appreciate the largest investment banks actually own the majority of the Quant firms, pour tens of billions into developing more complex algorithms and faster networks between their server farms. In addition many banks have brokerage firms as a part of their operations, such as BoA (with ML) and Credit Suisse. Without coming off as too cynical, the severe danger that comes with this one-sided ecosystem is banks have been known to dump and buy colossal quantities of any currency they fancy in less than a tenth of a second, massively destabilizing the currency itself. **Equities are small-fry compared with the profit potential of literally manufacturing volatility.**
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
Events such as the 2010 'flashcrash' highlight how detached the Blackbox system has become. $860billion USD evaporated in approximately 8 seconds as  conditions mutated into a complete mathematical anomaly and, there's no way not to be dramatic about this, the market *vanished.* A vanishing market means there are no buyers on the other side of the sellers. The entire market, for ~8 seconds, was selling. This might not sound like such a dangerous situation but remember that in order for a market to be liquid, and stable, you need one end to take up the deal from the other (at any price). Imagine for a moment FB stock went into a freefall to assumed zero and every sentiment metric said 100% sellers. This does not mean every action is a sell action, it just means every action taken by a trading algorithm is a buy action. In other words, the blackbox market is buying 100% of the sold shares. Now imagine for a moment even the algorithms had decided it was not possible to take up any end of the trade. The result is a complete and utter illiquidity in the stock. It would be pandemonium. 
This did indeed happen, in 2010, only it wasn't localised to one company, rather it was everything: Currencies, Equities, Commodities, Bonds, Interest Swaps. 
 
How does this help you? I believe awareness is the best asset for a trader. The automated ecosystem has many implications, it also explains who takes up the other end of trades. I've had many questions of the topic in the last couple of years and it's not an easy one to explain. Essentially the Vanguard mutual funds, pen funds, estate funds and any other private cap management firm is recognised as the ""dumb money"" for this reason. They're the only significant entities outside the system and always end up losing more than those on the inside. ",4

I am thinking about liquidating both my retirement through work (~$350,000) and my 401(K) (~$270,000) and playing the market on my own. I am 34. 

I would like to invest a portion of this in physical items. ie Cars, Jewelry, Playboy magazines, etc. These are things that everyone will always want. Playboy is about to stop showing nude women so imagine how much some of those old collections will be worth a few years from now! 

I also want to put a large portion of this into the oil/gas trading things like UGAZ, DGAZ, , ERY, ERX, etc. Oil is going to back up and I want to profit on that instead of being in some t-rowe etf. 

Here's my plan:

-100k in day trading highly leveraged ETFs of oil, gas, and other commodities. I don't know much about this but I think I will just read what others are doing on yahoo message boards or stocktwits or investing.com message board. 
- 300k in cars, playboy magazines, and jewelry (all vintage or antique). 

Any suggestions on where to put the rest of my money **except** in a t-rowe etf or something else that I would get in a 401k. I also don't want to donate it to charity so please don't suggest that.

Hi everyone. I am a new investor. I do have a 401(k) and profit sharing plan through work that has gone into a retirement fund for me. Other than this, I have not invested on my own.

I am thinking about liquidating both my retirement through work (~$350,000) and my 401(K) (~$270,000) and playing the market on my own. I am 34.

I would like to invest a portion of this in physical items. ie Cars, Jewelry, Playboy magazines, etc. These are things that everyone will always want. Playboy is about to stop showing nude women so imagine how much some of those old collections will be worth a few years from now!

I also want to put a large portion of this into the oil/gas trading things like UGAZ, DGAZ, , ERY, ERX, etc. Oil is going to back up and I want to profit on that instead of being in some t-rowe etf.
Here's my plan:

-100k in day trading highly leveraged ETFs of oil, gas, and other commodities. I don't know much about this but I think I will just read what others are doing on yahoo message boards or stocktwits or investing.com message board. 

- 300k in cars, playboy magazines, and jewelry (all vintage or antique).

Any suggestions on where to put the rest of my money except in a t-rowe etf or something else that I would get in a 401k. I also don't want to donate it to charity so please don't suggest that.

Thanks, Alan",0

15-10-24,"What It's Really Like Being A Full Time Penny Stocks Trader","For most people that are searching for a way out of their boring 9-5 life, the thought of trading for a living seems like a fantasy job. The good news is that becoming a self employed full time trader is completely possible if a person is willing to take the time to learn how the markets works (not just rush in), put in the effort to stay one head a step of the competition (other traders) and  be able to deal with the realities of becoming a full time trader. Traders are a unique group of people, and although trading for a living can provide the financial freedom that many people are searching for, it can also have some challenges as well. I wanted to list some of the biggest ones so you will be able to have realistic expectations. So many people think they can start trading with a few hundred bucks, spend 10 minutes a week, and become millionaires. The whole trading industry is at fault here for lying about the fact that this is actually true. This truth this is a fallacy and I want you to be fully aware of what it takes to be a full time trader.

 You Have To Put In The Time:

Before placing every trade you have to understand the probabilities that are involved. Trading is like a game of chess. You need to think several steps ahead and know what the potential outcomes are. There’s always going to be unknowns, as is the case with any sort of probabilistic situation, but a trader can greatly increase their chance of success by calculating each outcome and have a defined plan. It’s just basic math, but it really can make or break you as a trader. Successfully trading is not a fly by the seat of your pants endeavor as most people think. You aren’t shooting from the hip but instead acting like a sniper, choosing the perfect time to take the shot and finish your prey off before they know what hit them.

 

 Failure Is Required To Succeed In Trading:

If you meet a trader who says they have never made a mistake, failed or lost money, chances are they are lying to you. You will fail, make a mistakes and take loses, no matter how hard you work. At times it will be painful to stomach, particularly if you are using trading as your main source of income. You need to be prepared to handle this reality, take it in stride, learn from your mistakes and move on. It would be great if you could start trading on day one with $500 and a week later have $50,000, $500,000, or even $5 million. The reality is that this is near impossible no matter what the guru’s will try to make you believe. The amount of money you can earn is directly tied to the size of your account. In the beginning you will see small profits of a few hundred or a few thousand and over time, as you progress and your account size increases, so will the size of your profits. If you make it as a trader the sky really is the limit so in my opinion it’s worth it to take a chance.

 

 You Have To Become Disciplined:

If you aren’t a disciplined person you won’t make it in trading. This is the truth… You can have the best trading system in the world but if you don’t stick to the signals, it’s basically useless. This means you also need the discipline to cut your losing trades quickly before the destroy all of your profitable trades. You must also be disciplined enough to sit down at your computer each day, put in the time and do the research that you need to be prepared. If you are lazy you won’t make it as a trader, I can guarantee you this. Remember you are your own boss as an independent trader. If you are a person that needs somebody else to boss you around in order to get your work done, trading probably is not for you.

 

Follow The Market Each And Every Day:

In order to commit to a job as a full time trader you must be willing able to commit to a traders schedule. This requires keeping track of any open positions, how the overall market is trading, and any potential setups. The market is constantly changing so you should always be paying attention to what is going on. This is time consuming but it’s completely necessary because you  will never be able to make it as a trader if you can’t follow the overall “market pulse”. The good news is that you will be spending time doing something that you enjoy doing, rather than pushing papers for your ungrateful boss. In my opinion, I would much rather spend each and every day focused on doing something I love which will pay me nicely, rather than working in a cubicle for 40+ hours a week and be barely able to pay my bills.

 

It’s Unlikely That You Will Immediately Make Money:

In the beginning you are very unlikely to make enough money as a trader to live full time. This is because trading has a learning curve. It’s going to take at least a short period of time in most cases so you need to accept the fact that learning to trade takes some time (despite what the guru’s claim). The saying “Earn while you learn” is not realistic for most people unless they are starting out with a bullet proof trading system like this and even then it will require at least a couple months.  If you plan to trade full time you need to save up enough money and be able to cover your expenses as your get your trading business going. The more money you can start with, the greater the chance of success provided you have a solid trading system and a bullet proof trading plan already in place. The reason so many people fail as traders is because they underestimate what they are getting themselves into.

 

You Will Not Have The Free Time You Imagined:

Although you will certainly have more flexibility with your schedule as a trader, you won’t have all the free time you imagined, especially in the beginning. Becoming a full time trader takes hours of work each day. You must remember that although you can set your own schedule, going on vacation any time you want, and trade from anywhere in the world, you only get paid when you are trading, and therefore you have spend time. If you think you can work 15 minutes a day and earn six figures think again. While some days you could be in and out of the market in the first 5 minutes with a huge profit, sometimes more than the average person earns in a month or even a year, this is not the norm, especially in the beginning. You will need to spend time in front of the computer, and be prepared at all times. While trading for a living has its challenges and is far from a traditional way of earning a living, it is an awesome way for the right people with the proper mindset, to become financially successful while doing a job that they love to do.

 

In closing:

Now keep in mind you don’t have to immediately start out of as a full time trader. I actually suggest that you DON’T do this. The main reason is you need to see if trading is right for you before you make a such a huge potentially life changing decision. Once you have started to learn and see a bit of success, then you can decide if you are cut out for a career as a full time trader. Some people are not cut out for trading and they belong working 9-5 jobs but remember if you don’t give this a shot and get started, you have no chance to ever be successful.

15-10-24,"$SGNL Why I'm Still Holding","There are several reasons why people claim to hold this stock or are investing more money into it at these levels. Some of those reasons are ""the cash value of the company being at 1.30"" some other reasons are that the biotech sell off among other market conditions have caused the stock to drop to unwarranted levels. 

My reasons have little to do with the actual fundamentals of the company. I bought high, at an unreasonable level, a level this stock probably should not have reached on such day based on the news that was released, but guess what? It did. Recently, they released another PR, regarding expansion of its reimbursement. I don't believe that the news had any real milestone implications, it did align with the goals of SGNL in terms of expanding its insurance reimbursement platform but it still doesn't highlight any significant profits for the company in the near term. I had people on stocktwits wondering why I wasn't excited, the reality was, I knew the gains wouldn't hold. The stock rose this day 30% to a high of 1.24. Should it have reacted that way? Probably not, but it did, again, the stock spiked. 

The main reason I'm holding, is because this stock will SPIKE, whether for good reason or not, it will SPIKE and that spike will be determined on the strength of the PR they release. The last conference the company held, they spoke about a potential new product being released in Q4 or Q1 of next year. They talked about expanding their MyPRS test for other types of cancer diagnosis and they also talked about releasing information regarding the partnerships they struck up with motif cancer center and other partners. 

There WILL be more news. The biotech selfoff didn't just hurt this stock but it punished other stocks I've been watching like $NYMX and $CANF. If this stuff is cyclical, selling now at .89 is murder. There should be an opportunity to exit this stock more gracefully in the future, that future can be 3 months away, 6 months away, I don't really know. But my exit strategy is to set a limit order at the 200 day Moving Average and just forget about it. It bounced at 2.03 and fell on sep 23rd (200 dma) and it bounced off 1.24 and fell (50 dma). A break above the DMA's will be worth buying. If the news is potent enough to build investor confidence in future profits, this will be worth holding even post breakout. 

For me, the stress and pain of this stock, which wiped out all my gains in over a year, is simply not worth the headache. If I see an opportunity to exit with half the loss I have today, I will probably take that opportunity. IMHO, buying at these levels is still risky, but there is ample upside for a good swing trade given the catalyst I foresee happening within the next 180 days. GLTA.",4

I am extremely optimistic in this company having some incredible results in the future 5-10 years.

It seems right now the stock is overvalued as they are not profitable. If you read the article they have barely entered in what they call ""stage 2"" of their plan.

I feel like they are at least laying the groundwork for an industry that had yet to be realized.

With that being said the stock currently is fluctuating between 205 - 215.  Estimates  price it at 170. They have an earnings call on 11/3.  I would like to get in on the action but only if it drops closer to the 170 -180 level.  I no they've been having problems with the model x production but it sounds like their only problem is that the supply can't meet the demand (which sounds like a good problem to have).

Long story short. I really don't want to gamble by picking it up now and seeing it drop after the earnings call; but then again don't want to be kicking myself if i miss the wave and it gets an upgrade.

I am simply presenting a case for continuing to stay in AVXL long-term after the Nov 7 play, but if that is your intended exit point, you should decide for yourself how you manage your positions. 
--

**0. Background**
Some background on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the state of the market -- despite the large number of sufferers and associated costs (it is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the US), which are projected to increase as baby boomers age, there are only 5 AD treatments on the market, and none approved by the FDA since 2003 (NIH ADEAR, 7/2015). Presently, there are *no* drugs that can even slow let alone cure the progression of AD. All treatments, including frontline drug donepezil (aka Aricept), provide symptomatic relief only, and their effects are fairly modest (Rogers et al, 2003; Seltzer B et al, 2004). Clearly, there is an enormous unmet need, and any company that is able to take advantage of the situation could potentially monopolize the market for the foreseeable future.


**1. The (lack of) competition**
I believe that if a company were to emerge from the contenders, it is Anavex. Though clinical data on lead candidate A2-73 is limited at best, the therapeutic potential of its novel mechanism of action (preventing and degrading misfolded proteins by activation of σ1R, a chaperone protein) is supported by an extensive body of literature in peer-reviewed publications. (I am **not** an expert in Alzheimer's, but I am a research scientist in a related field, and have personally reviewed much of the primary literature -- the science is rock solid!) Presuming the final P2A data can recapitulate the early findings of the interim report, this drug candidate has the potential to blow everything introduced so far out of the water. The interim P2A PR suggested that in 10/12 patients, the improvement was ""approximately 4 times higher than donepezil"" (Anavex PR 7/22/2015). This is significant not just because it sounds impressive -- FDA ""breakthrough therapy"" designation and approval guidelines specifically require that new drugs ""show a clear advantage over available therapy"", which would establish a burden of proof that rival candidates would have difficulty matching with regards to efficacy (FDA).

Speaking of competitors, two of the most high-profile candidates are Eli Lilly's ($LLY) solanezumab and Axovant's ($AXON) RVT-101. Though solanezumab has potential and some data has suggested it may even slow damage to the brain from AD (according to certain measures only), it has had a troubled development cycle and previously missed primary endpoints in a P3. Similarly, RVT-101 data has been mixed. It was originally developed by GlaxoSmithKline, but later sold to Axovant after it failed **four** different Phase 2 trials. Only in the last one did it show statistically significant improvement in certain metrics, which are now the primary endpoints of their current Phase 3 due to end in April/May 2016. Recently, there was a bearish report by Chardan Capital on RVT-101 raising questions about the exclusion criteria of GSK's trials, which may have been cherry-picked and the expansion of which could increase the risk of P3 failure (Amusa G 6/18/15). I personally believe that RVT-101 will succeed in P3, but neither of these two drugs are particularly impressive compared to interim data for A2-73.


**2. Anavex's relative (under)valuation**
Much has already been said about the great job CEO Dr. Christopher Missling has done in turning the company around and his financial maneuvering to counter bad news with good. I believe that given its technology, management/financial situation, and patent protection, this company is grossly undervalued at this time. $AVXLD closed at $7.65 yesterday (10/23/15), giving it a market cap of $238.11M.

Consider that despite having no drugs in development and existing solely for the purpose of pushing RVT-101 through clinical trials, $AXON is still valued at $1.26B. The day after their IPO, $AXON rode the biotech bubble to a $2.96B market cap. If it's not obvious by now, I do not hold a very high opinion of Axovant with regards to their science or their stock as an investment. If this company, pushing a candidate that $GSK gave up on and sold for a mere $5M plus royalties, is worth over $1B, there is no reason $AVXL's value should stay so low, *assuming A2-73 clinical data continues to stay excellent through P2B and onwards towards P3*. 

Without even factoring in anything else, if $AVXL were to reach a more 'fair' valuation comparable to $AXON, that would give it a share price of $40.50, a 429.4% increase over the current trading price. If AVXL were to move toward a $3B market cap, that would represent a gain of 1,143.7% for a share price of $95.14.

I would not bet on either of those two price point suggestions being reached by November 7, but in my mind, they reflect the upside of the company and A2-73's blockbuster potential if certain other future catalysts come to fruition, such as...


**3. The case for long-term upside**
Within the next year (and possibly even before 2016), Anavex should announce the start of new trials for additional indications of A2-73. Since the drug prevents protein misfolding — the accumulation of these plaques has been implicated as a likely causal factor in the development and progression of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders — it is probable it will also show promise in the treatment of additional diseases (ALS, Parkinson's, CTE, maybe even CJD/prions).

Earlier this year, Anavex received a research grant from the Michael J. Fox Foundation to study the clinical effects of A2-73 in Parkinson’s disease (to be compared to another potential σ1R agonist, PRE-084; MJFF Research Grant 1450). Additionally, they have been aggressively adding pre-eminent scientists to their board, including Dr. Jackie French, an epilepsy expert. She is quoted as saying, ""I am extremely impressed with the positive preclinical epilepsy data for ANAVEX 2-73, which demonstrates a significant reduction in anti-seizure efficacy relative to three currently approved epilepsy drugs as well as significant synergy with each of these drugs” (Anavex PR 3/12/15).

Finally, I alluded to it earlier, but given the dearth of good AD treatments and the strikingly positive initial P2A data, I believe A2-73 has a very good chance of receiving Fast Track and/or Breakthrough Therapy status designation from the FDA. This would be tremendous because Ananex would be eligible to receive feedback and guidance from the FDA in addition to accelerated approval and priority review, moving up the timeline for A2-73 approval closer in line to that of their competitors in P3. Pharmas often apply for fast track status around P2, though it can happen any phase, so it would not surprise me if Anavex applied for such a designation within the next several months, perhaps on the strength of their P2A data. Also, this is purely speculative on my part, but by extending the P2A Part B window to 52 weeks, this may also be a decision aimed at reducing the length of P2B and possibly P3 down the line. 

Continued success in successive trials for AD and the announcement of new trials or partnerships for additional indications would all be noteworthy future catalysts that could vault Anavex to multi-billion dollar valuations, long after the Nov 7 CTAD presentation for P2A data. 


**4. Risks**
Maybe someone out of the blue comes up with a miracle drug that crushes everything, even A2-73. Maybe a meteor strikes the earth and everyone wishes they put their $AVXL money into an underground bunker from Doomsday Preppers. Maybe as more data is received, it turns out A2-73 just isn't that good or doesn't work. Promising drugs fail all the time later in their developmental lives, and in the case of AD drugs, that rate is a whopping 99.6% that fail to receive FDA approval. Failure is certainly possible since the available data is still extremely limited for A2-73 at this time. 

**Any investment decision you make should be yours, and yours only!** 

That said, there is nothing so far to dampen my enthusiasm personally. Even if A2-73 data were to suddenly turn sour in P2B or P3, I anticipate those trial results won't be available until **after** the potential catalysts mentioned in section 3. In my opinion, there is still quite a lot of growth potential in the stock all the way through 2016. 

&amp;nbsp;

**EDIT:** As a clarification, when I say that the ""science is rock solid"", the science to which I am referring is the substantial body of literature on the σ1R, **not** Anavex's own interim data, which I explicitly state is preliminary and ""limited at best.""",19

15-10-25,Uniqlo Store Opening Line in Chicago 2 Days Ago,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D72dZ5p5Oxw (I didn't take the video, but have followed the company and looked for Youtube videos to see if there were any line vids after finding they were opening a new store in the US.)

Line is pretty huge for the opening of a clothing store.

Note: I'm not invested in this, don't plan to be (nothing against the company, I find it very interesting but tend to stay away from clothing), just bringing the company to the attention of those on here as I think it's something some on here may like. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH BEFORE INVESTING.

This is not an event to invest based upon by any means, but it does illustrate the reception to the brand.

Uniqlo's parent company is Japanese company Fast Retailing (FRCOY is the ADR symbol in the US.)

The company offers inexpensive clothing and is trying to be competitive with the Gap. It has been called an IKEA for clothing on more than one occasion.

It started paying a small dividend last year.

Aside from the guide to stock research under 'useful online resources' in the sidebar, can anybody give me any suggestions on how to proceed? What are things to know about? What are common (rookie) mistakes?  How much money can or should i invest? I'm not a particulary rich person by any means, but i'm having some money (~ €300) come my way soon so i am considering investing it instead of saving it up like i usually do. 

I'm not expecting big money at all nor am i expecting any results or profit on the short-term, especially considering i have a fairly low budget, but i'd like to know what i'm (trying) to do is a good idea.

* Market sentiment is extremely positive and we will beat the all-time high by the end of the year. The 2,200 I called about six months ago doesn't look all that far anymore. Remember the market crashed on some stupid fear by stock manipulators. In fact:

It seems ""obvious"" to me that Apple will crush estimates harder than I crushed my chances of ever having a girlfriend. Being available in so many countries, and the general market for cellphones growing so fast, I think we can reasonably imply a 10-15% growth in sales for the iPhone YoY.

* The iPad should have been revigorated, but the difference will be more obvious the next quarter. As for the mac, they will set another record.

* Apple Pay is totally new and is accretive to earnings. So is apple music. And Apple Watch. Out of a the $50B in revenue, that's perhaps an additional $2-3B in totally new revenue (!) at a high margin

* The stock buyback, holy ****! So many fewer shares today when compared to a year ago! This of course reduces the dividend burden of the company and increases the EPS. Genius move by a genius CEO. I mean, already, there is 1B shares gone and I think we can safely add another 100-200M shares gone this quarter (!!!)

* The cash pile is growing again. At this rhythm, Apple will have more cash than its market value within 10 years. LOL @ that.

15-10-26,Give me a bear case for T and VZ.,"In my moderately-sized portfolio, I hold 450 shares of VZ and 600 shares of T. Altogether, they generate over $2,000 in dividends per year for me and while there hasn't been a lot of price appreciation, they have mostly remained stable over the past couple of years. 

However, they both constitute nearly 60% of my overall portfolio and I'm having some second thoughts of being so overweight on telecom stocks, even if the stability and dividends they offer are nice.

Conventional wisdom says that their huge moats (in the form of extensive infrastructure) should protect them from outside competitors attempting to enter the telecom market. However, the advent of Google Fiber on the wireline side and increased competition from Sprint and T-Mobile on the wireless side threaten T and VZ's margins. They haven't been huge issues yet, but people like me are keeping a wary eye on matters.  

And lastly, this moat doesn't come cheap - both T and VZ carry a lot of debt, though T has been paring down on its debt over the past year or so. 

I do not have DRIPs set up for T and VZ - I merely use the dividends I receive from them to shore up my cash position. 

So, any thoughts? I think that T and VZ are perhaps the safest places to park one's money outside of a bond fund, but there are caveats to their business models and nothing stays still forever. ",2

(From http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-10-25/crisis-alpha-why-volatility-only-asset-class)
&gt; Excerpted from Artemis Capital Management letter to investors,

  There is a tiresome debate as to whether or not volatility is an asset class. Let me end that debate... Volatility is the ONLY asset class. We are all volatility traders and the only question is whether we realize it or not.  If you disagree do me a favor and imagine you are an alien that just landed on earth and you know nothing about investing. Stocks, bonds, what are those? All you have to look at are numbers.

Most investments will show upward growth in a steady and seductive line until they experience horrific drawdowns: classic value investing, credit, real estate, and carry trades all fit this profile and are akin to shorting volatility, correlation, and dispersion. Other investments exhibit negative to flat returns with huge profit jumps that occur infrequently. Examples include global macro funds, trend-following CTAs, and tail-risk funds.

Most of what we think of as alpha is actually short volatility in sheep’s clothing. To prove this point we took a cross section of popular hedge fund strategies and compared their returns against selling naked put options on the S&amp;P 500 index. The results speak for themselves and the average hedge fund strongly resembles a simple short volatility position.



I find it puzzling why institutions focus on superficial asset buckets but fail to categorize investments by what really matters... return profile. This is akin to categorizing a blue and green parakeet as two entirely different species of animal, but putting an alligator and the green parakeet in the same bucket. Diversification is futile if you do not categorize by return style.

Many investors assemble a varied portfolio of asset classes and hedge funds thinking there is safety in diversification... but all that is achieved is concentrated short convexity exposure. In a crisis the portfolio is revealed for what it really is – majority short volatility with no diversification at all.



Very few investments maintain a dedicated long convexity return profile. It can be hard to hang out with the designated driver when everyone else is getting drunk from the global monetary punchbowl. Many great investors understand that having a convex asset in their portfolio allows them to buy when everyone else is selling, stick with their investment plan in times of duress, or even apply a bit of leverage onto their beta to pay for any negative carry in the low turbulence years.

It takes a very special breed of investor to allocate to a long volatility fund and be able to tolerate years of neutral performance to small losses when everything else is going up in value... only to achieve remarkable gains when everything else crashes and burns. The key is to view a portfolio holistically, understanding that long volatility exposure provides tremendous flexibility and better risk adjusted returns over the entire business cycle. The two classifications of positive convexity hedge funds are long volatility funds and tail risk funds. While long volatility and tail risk both provide exposure to crisis, they represent very different vintages.

CBOE/Eurekahedge publishes indices that track the respective performance of each style.

CHART

They say that being short volatility is like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. If I had a penny every time somebody mischaracterized Artemis as a tail risk fund I could probably buy a steamroller.

Long volatility hedge funds are in search of crisis alpha defined as an uncorrelated return stream whereby the balance of risk and reward is skewed toward systemic crisis in markets without the constant negative carry associated with traditional hedging. This vintage of convexity should have a positive risk-to-reward ratio overall but with the best gains reserved for market crashes. To achieve this end such funds may balance long volatility exposure with strategic shorts or use tactical exposure to gain convexity. These funds are better at capturing regime shifts in volatility associated with bear markets as opposed to one off volatility spikes that mean revert in a bull market. That nuance is lost on many investors. Long volatility funds are designed to capture market endogenous forms of crisis (e.g. 2008 financial crash, 2011 debt ceiling crash) but may or may not capture market exogenous crises (e.g. market sell-off from 9/11 terror attack).

Tail risk hedge funds are effectively a form of financial asset insurance that provides constant exposure to long convexity, with strong reactivity to crisis, but constant negative bleed.  The tail risk fund has a negative expected return (absent a combination with equity beta) and is more of a pure hedge, as opposed to the long volatility fund, which is an alpha strategy that behaves like a hedge. Tail risk funds are positively exposed to both market endogenous and exogenous events, and do a better job capturing one-off volatility spikes. The CBOE tail risk index brings much needed transparency to tail risk funds, some of whom prefer to remain opaque to the disadvantage of investors. For example, one provider that is not a member of the index, reported recent returns to the financial media on a margin basis (effectively doubling or quadrupling returns) while reportedly excluding the fact that a portion of that performance was generated by buying equity futures the morning of a volatility spike. In actuality, this fund’s performance was in line or likely below the CBOE tail risk hedge fund index on an equal comparison basis (non-margined). All the funds in the tail risk and long volatility indices have agreed to a level of performance transparency and fairness to the benefit of investors.  



Long volatility and tail risk funds can be combined with basic equity exposure to create fantastic returns. A 50/50 combination of the CBOE long volatility hedge fund index and the S&amp;P 500 index has significantly outperformed the market and the HFRX global hedge fund index since 2008 (see above).

In many cases, institutions can layer the convex derivatives exposure directly on the equity beta so there is no lost opportunity cost. The difference is that investors are only paying for ‘crisis alpha’ and not generic beta or short convexity exposure.

The best long volatility funds are like guerilla freedom fighters as opposed to a standing army. Small is better than large for long volatility because convexity does not scale as easily as fragility. Long volatility is a tough business model which is why it is so rare to find funds that offer true exposure. It is simple human nature to lose interest in an asset that has flat returns for years at a time with huge payouts only occasionally. Plain vanilla short convexity funds that make steady returns are a much easier sell and accrue incentive fees faster until they blow up.

Somebody once said that he thought there would be a $10+ billion volatility fund one day... that may be true… but at that point, it may cease to be a true volatility fund and risks becoming just an average hedge fund. Small is beautiful. Hedgehogs outlasted dinosaurs.

EDIT: I'm only knowledgeable about Bogleheads strategy and DRIP investing so this VIX/Volatility trading concept is eye opening and humbling. What other simple long term strategies are good for small, independent investors?

I don't see anything on the vanguard website listing what its dividend returns for VYM have been in the past. I know that when I invest in a total stock market index like VTSMX, it just takes whatever dividends it received and automatically reinvests them for me, but I assume that if an ETF or index fund is specifically called a ""High Dividend ETF"" that it pays out the dividends to you, rather than reinvesting them, right? If not, is there something else I should be looking for which could give me this? Or can I only receive dividends when investing in individual companies?

On a sidenote, are there any ETFs or index funds besides VYM that you would suggest I take a look at?",4

Is this normal, or irresponsible?","We recently did a grand survey of our finances and realized that once you figure out all the numbers, we have only a little over $120,000 in actual assets.  But once I took a closer look at all the options contracts I was writing, I realized that I'm exposing myself to somewhere around $45 million dollars in total risk at one time.  
  
My wife freaked out, but I tried to explain that due to the nature of derivatives it's normal to be exposed to this much risk at once.  As well, I consult with some pretty smart people and typically play both sides.  Also, as a result of this exposure, it's likely I'm going to probably increase the value of our assets several times over in the next few years - so ultimately I don't see a problem with it.

15-10-26,New UK investor with some questions for those more experienced,"Hey Im a newly qualified doctor, 25 years, just been working for a year and just started getting interested in financial independence, frugality and investing the past few months. I have no experience whatsoever with the stock market and investing and neither do any of my friends or family so im naturally apprehensive about the whole idea. I would like to get some advice who've been there and done it. Rely I would like to start investing soon with a time horizon of at least 10 years, looking for growth and then after this I would consider retiring fully but likely just work part time.  I estimate I will need £250,000 at 5% to retire giving passive income of 12,500 pa. 

So ive read a few books and it seems whats popular on here and what seems to make sense to me as a good method is modern portfolio theory. One book im reading is the intelligent asset allocator which basically boils down to investing in low cost passivley managed index funds in a diversified manner to help reduce risk and maximise returns, then buy and hold rebalancing annually or even less frequently. One question is … is modern portfolio theory still modern? Is this still an effective and widely used strategy? Because the book was written agesssss ago. 

Looking into it more it seems that the Vanguard lifestrategy funds seems like a good product to achieve these objectives being very diversified with good track record and will likely have done good research to achieve the “efficent frontier” with their asset allocation. However the change of 0.24% seems quite high, is their anything that stops me from just copying their asset allocation from those funds using vanguards passively managed ETF's? I appreciate I wouldn't get the rebalancing done for me but I imagine rebalancing isn't that technically difficult?

Another product that seems interesting is betterment, one of the new roboinvestors. However this currently only runs in US and I cant find anything like it with charges as low in UK. So another question is.... how do people invest in different countries? Or dont they? I imagine if i convert all my UK earnings to USD then invest that would be a very bad strategy due to currency conversion charges/ bad exchange rates. 

Final question not about strategy but just out of interest – if I invest in a manner similar to modern portfolio theory my understanding is that I am theoretically investing in a massive proportion of the whole market of the entire world. So why the hell does my portfolio grow faster than inflation?! What is growth anyway? I suppose money = goods or services and goods are made by people in a way so money = people so one could say that economic growth is because of population growth? Probably a question more for the philosophy subreddit.   ",3

15-10-26,"A plan to ""dissent"" from private company shareholder agreement change","Hi everyone, this is an x-post from /r/PersonalFinance, but actually think this may be a better home for the discussion. My plan is to dissent from a proposed change for a shareholder agreement to get the company to pay me fair value for my shares now because I think they are setting up a structure that will mean I won't get paid in the future unless was an extremely generous buyout. I'm interested to know if people agree or disagree with this approach.
I had 10000 stock options which I exercised about five years ago for a private Ontario corporation. On Friday, the Corporation emailed all shareholders requesting that they sign an amended shareholder agreement and requested everyone do so as soon as possible. They included a couple of documents as follows:

The amended agreement which set out:
a)	a clause to add in addition to common shares (what I have) Class A Preferred Shares. These preferred shares would have a “pre-closing amount” of $1.50. The agreement goes on to say in the case of a “liquidation event” that preferred shares will receive 2 times the “pre-closing amount” plus any declared and unpaid dividends payable with respect to the preferred shares in cash, securities or other property. After that distribution happens these Class A Preferred Shares will participate as equals with the common shares to distribute the remaining assets.
b)	As a schedule, an excerpt of section 185 of the Business Corporations Act of Ontario which sets out the rights of dissenting shareholders. This basically says if you disagree, you can dissent and the Corporation if possible must pay you “fair value”. An exception says that if this payment would prevent the company from paying their liabilities, they don’t have to.

They don’t indicate the number of debentures that they are selling or the number of (I assume) preferred shares that they will be converted into, as well as at what price. Previously I had asked for the number of shares outstanding and that’s the only reason I have that piece of information.

Ultimately, it seems like the sort of predatory VC financing that happens (only a guess) where a company demands preferential terms in order to provide funds.

Without knowing how many preferential versus common shares there are, it’s impossible to know the size of a buyout offer that would be required in order to receive any money at all for common shares.

I'm unsure about how to determine “fair value” of a private corporation’s common shares? If I dissent and the company agrees to pay me “fair value” how do I know that they aren’t grossly underestimating what the fair value is? I feel like I would be stuck believing whatever they say

15-10-26,Penny Stocks,"Hello everyone. I have been following this sub for a few months now. I just graduated college last May and wanted to educate myself on the stock market. Since I knew going into it, that I have no idea what I am doing, I have been using paper money with thinkorswim until I gained the confidence (or really until I got a real job with a decent salary) to gamble with actual money.

To get to the point of this post, I still don't think I understand the worry or concern for penny stocks. To me, I would much rather spend $300 on 1,000 shares of a stock at .30 than 6 shares of a stock at $50. I look at it as I'm spending the same amount of capital, but with penny stocks I have a chance for a much higher return. I know with using paper money I bypass all the fees and such that go into trading but if I'm already willing to spend X-amount of dollars, is it really that irresponsible to put that towards a stock that could either boom or bust? Of course the stocks I am referring to are $AMDA, $OMER, $ASTI hahahah

It might be worth noting and is probably obvious that I did not get my degree in econ or finance. However my roommate is currently double majoring in both and has advised me to stay away from penny stocks because I can lose my money, but doesn't everyone already know that from the start?

15-10-26,"Amazon, AWS, and the $200B mystery","AMZNs latest Q3 results showed that their AWS division was growing revenue at quite the pace, and with close to 25% operating margins, is easily AMZNs crown jewel. However, as I myself pointed out, AWS only accounts for 8% of AMZNs total revenue, but **50%** of operating profits. 

[Here's an article today (quite bullish, IMO) of AWS' standalone valuation, with the relevant part:](http://techinsidr.com/is-amazon-web-services-a-100b-business/)

&gt; Given these unique characteristics, I feel that a 13X revenue multiple is more appropriate for valuation purposes. AWS’s revenue growth and profitability is off the charts and they occupy a dominant competitive position in the SaaS application delivery space. Using a 13X revenue multiple, it results in a standalone valuation of **$104B.** [Emphasis mine]

Nevermind the fact that valuation depends on profits, not revenues, we'll value AWS along Bezos preferred method. So here's the $104B question: With AMZNs current market cap close to $300B, where's the remaining $200B-ish of the market cap coming from? All from low margin retail division? Drones? Or do AMZN bulls expect AWS to completely take over the company, despite contributing only a sliver to revenues (and as /u/redcards pointed out, [very capital intensive.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3ptdow/amazon_shoots_up_9_on_surprise_profit/cwad6ju)

To reiterate: AMZN market cap is almost $300B, AWS can be valued at $100B, where's the other 2/3 of the market cap value to be found?

So why would someone, or a group of someones w/ a lot of capital try to keep the price down via shorts?  Is it to drive the price down, drive retail investors out who are freaked, and then buy the stock value price on an expected future rise?

15-10-27,Corporate bond funds and their exposure to financials,"While examining different corporate bond ETFs, I noticed that many bond funds seem substantially exposed to the finance sector. I see percentages of up to 60% of all positions in financial businesses. 

I'm trying to grasp whether such funds make sense. It might simply be that the financial sector is so huge that these exposures are warranted. My knowledge of the financial sector is simply not extensive enough.

But if our purpose is to lend money to companies so that they can produce services or goods, why would we lend to a financial sector that in turn would just lend (in one form or another) also to other companies? Or, if the financial sector instead of lending invests with the money we borrowed them, will this not provide a correlation between these bond funds to stocks in general? Would the latter not be undesirable when the goal is diversification into different asset classes?

TL;DR: Does substantial exposure to the financial sector make sense in our bond funds?

15-10-26,Understanding the difference between the emotions you can’t avoid and the ones that will ruin you when trading,"By Ryan Henry at TrendLizard.com

Trading can be an emotional rollercoaster. Watching a trade move firmly in your favor is exhilarating. Tracking the movements of a high-flyer that you are preparing to trade is exciting. Buying into a price move that you have big plans for is satisfying. Taking a big gain off the table is really fulfilling. Conversely, watching a promising trade reverse and fail on you can be painful.  No doubt, emotional responses come with almost every facet of the trading game.
 
It’s probably not a great idea to live and die with every trade you make, especially since you can almost guarantee that you’ll lose half the time. A less stressful approach is to understand that taking losses is the cost of doing business, just like the electricity bill. But honestly, these aren’t the types of emotions you have to worry about. The ones that can foil your plans of being a consistently successful trader are the ones that impact your trading decisions.
 
For me, one of my biggest emotional reactions I get from trading has nothing to do with the trades I’ve actually entered. Once I’m in a trade, the hard work is over.The only reason I am in the trade is because that trade fit my requirements perfectly and my risk is manageable – I won’t take the trade otherwise. And from there it’s out of my hands. Sure, I might be happy about a big gain or sad about a loss, but not for a second do these emotions impact my trading.
 
The most dangerous emotion I feel is the anxiety that comes with a trade I have not yet entered.  This is where pricey emotional mistakes could be made. When a market starts moving quickly and I cannot yet quantify what that market is up to, I get anxious. Sometimes I want to just take the trade, regardless of the context of this strong move. This feeling of anxiousness is something I can’t help; it’s who I am as a trader because it pains me to miss any strong move that takes place on an instrument I track. But that doesn’t mean I allow these emotions to dictate my trading. Every trade is entered with the hope that price will move as fast as possible.
 
But I also know what conditions create a ripe environment for such a strong move; that’s the exact basis for my trading system. Specifically, I need to see a market that is giving us trendy price movement in the direction of a dominant trend. If those conditions don’t exist, then I can’t reasonably expect to participate in that strong move, unless I’m in the business of just randomly following my emotions as I see fit.  That’s not exactly a formula for success.
 
When sharp price action emerges out of nowhere, it’s a good idea to let it develop to better understand its intentions. Trends change, and these sharp moves may very well signify that an important, tradable change is taking place. But if is, we can wait for whatever we’re trading to prove the change in trend before getting involved. Specifically I want to see price prove that a change has occurred, by correcting the new, strong price pattern, and then resume its new trend.
 
By understanding what my trading system is designed to do and that I won’t possibly catch every big move, it helps me better cope with the types of emotions that could otherwise lead to undisciplined and unsuccessful trading.",1

15-10-26,Old Disney Stock,"I had an old stock certificate from Disney that was gifted to me in 1993. I recently deposited that one share into an investing account at my bank. I was under the impression that this stock would now be worth 3 after a split in 1998. We moved around many times when I was a kid, so have not received a dividend Cheque in over 20 years (when I did received them, they were worth pennies and I was too young to care to cash them in and didn’t even have a bank account at that time…) 

After speaking to an investor at my bank, I was told I would have to contact a Disney transfer agent to get paper certificates to validate that I received additional shares with the split. Of course, after having not had my correct contact information, I found out that my account with Disney had been handed over to the state of Delaware. Since, I have verified that I have unclaimed assets, and have to wait 4-6 weeks for it to be released. 

My question…  when the account goes inactive- would I still even be a recipient of the stock splits? Would my dividends still be paid out to date, or only to the date of the time my account was considered inactive and handed over to the state? So confusing!!!!

The fund will facilitate direct investment in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states by Japanese food and agribusiness firms, ranging from grains and feed to vegetables, milk and dairy products, logistics and research firms, they said, aiming to spend at least 35 percent of the money in Oman.

The Gulf Japan Food Fund will be owned 37.5 percent by Oman's State General Reserve Fund. State-run Oman National Investments Development Co and Gulf Investment Corp, owned by the six GCC states, will hold a combined 12.5 percent.

Japan's Mizuho Bank and Norinchukin Bank will provide the remaining half of the capital.

The sultanate is trying to diversify its economy beyond oil, using state funds in international ventures that steer investment and technology back to Oman. (Reporting by Fatma Alarimi; Editing by Andrew Torchia and Louise Ireland)

Or do I still have a loss to carryover? I would imagine the tax I would owe on a long term $5k gain I've been holding for over a year would be maybe ~$1k. So do I still have a $4k loss to carryover? 

Hope my question is clear, let me know if I'm not explaining it correctly!",3

I have the monthly returns calculated for three stocks (AC, Suncor, BMO) from December 1st, 2008 to December 1st, 2014. To calculate the EWP do I get the geometric return for each stock over the time period, and then multiple each stocks return over the period by 0.33 (the weight) and add them up?

Form an Equally-weighted portfolio (EW) of the three stocks.    Calculate the beta for the EW portfolio  in  the  four-year  period  (2009-2014).

Dear Peter:

It is my experience that in Corporate America, even when all available data points to the same undeniable conclusion and when all stakeholders desire the same mutually beneficial outcome, an external force is often still required to effect meaningful and positive change. This is the current situation in which AIG shareholders find themselves. The company continues to severely underperform its peers and is now facing an increasingly onerous regulatory burden which will only further erode its competitive position. Despite definitive action on the part of Congress and regulators to encourage this company to become smaller and simpler by splitting up, you have shown no sign of urgency and have chosen a “wait and see…for years” strategy void of decisive leadership. As a result AIG consistently trades at a substantial discount to book value.  It is a “no-brainer” that the simple act of splitting this company up will greatly enhance shareholder value.  AIG should immediately:

Pursue tax free separations of both its life and mortgage insurance subsidiaries to create three independent public companies. Each would be small enough to mitigate and avert the Systemically Important Financial Institution (“SIFI”) designation.
Embark on a much needed cost control program to close the gap with peers.
We believe there is no more need for procrastination, the time to act is now. I have already heard from several large shareholders who are frustrated with the lack of clear progress and are supportive of an AIG break up. I cannot fathom how you could ignore repeated requests from shareholders to execute a plan that would release billions of dollars of capital, free the company from onerous excess regulation, and leave shareholders owning stock in three separate, market leading insurance franchises.

“AIG is frankly overdue in following in the footsteps of all other major multi-lines in breaking up Life and P&amp;C into separate companies.  By separating into three independent companies, reducing unnecessary corporate overhead, operating at average industry returns, and buying back stock, AIG can trade at over $100 per share – 66% above its current $60 price,” John Paulson, President, Paulson &amp; Co. Inc.

 

Too Big to Succeed

“We’re beginning to see discussions that these capital charges are sufficiently large it’s causing those firms to think seriously about whether or not they should spin off some of the enterprises to reduce their systemic footprint, and frankly, that’s exactly what we want to see happen.”  Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen, February 2014

Despite years of dismantling and selling non-core assets, AIG is still too large. The combination of life insurance and p&amp;c insurance into a single entity offers no net benefit to shareholders (proven by industry low ROE), a fact that has driven other major multiline insurers to aggressively focus on a single line of business.  We believe you must acknowledge that the current multiline strategy is not generating competitive returns. Separate monoline companies will be more focused, more efficient, generate better returns and, as a result, command significantly higher market valuations.

Additionally, “Because of AIG’s size and interconnectedness” the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) has deemed AIG a non-bank SIFI, subjecting the company to Federal Reserve oversight and increased capital requirements. We believe you must acknowledge that enhanced regulation is intended to be a tax on size, designed to approximate the cost that large companies impose on the financial system. The regulators have made clear that the best outcome is for SIFI’s to shrink and “reduce their systemic footprint.” If nothing is done, returns and AIG’s competitive position will continue to suffer as the SIFI regulation, including its costs and capital requirements, is fully implemented.

“The other way it [the FSOC Designation Process] can make the system safer is by providing an incentive for designated companies to change their structure or operations so they can reduce the risk they pose and change their designation and the amount of oversight. In many ways [this] outcome is more desirable than the first because it would allow business to find the more efficient way to reduce the risk they pose to the economy.” Senator Elizabeth Warren at Secretary Lew’s testimony before the Senate Banking Committee,  March 2015

We believe you should immediately pursue, in the quickest and most efficient manner, a separation of both life and mortgage insurance from the core p&amp;c insurance business. We believe all three companies would be small enough to avert the increased capital requirements and regulations associated with non-bank SIFI status. In the face of a changing and potentially punitive regulatory framework, you must realize that insurance businesses of AIG’s caliber are more valuable to shareholders if held directly than they are as part of a SIFI conglomerate.

 

Competitive Cost Structure

AIG’s ROE is below its peers not only because of size and capital constraints, but also because of lack of cost control. You have acknowledged that returns are below peers and must be improved, even going so far as to provide a long-term ROE goal of 10%, which is still below peers. At the same time you have suggested returns would not increase by more than 0.5% per year. Amazingly you have turned the quest for a 10% ROE into a half decade journey. The one thing we do agree on is AIG’s lack of competitiveness. Do you honestly think now is not the time for the inevitable AIG transformation?  You must be proactive and commit to closing 100% of the ROE gap between AIG and its peers.

It is now incumbent upon you to explain why, despite pressure from the stock price, regulators, and shareholders, the company should not take immediate and transformative action. Achieving these two goals in combination with continued share repurchases is the only realistic path to a healthy and competitive company and, more importantly, exceed the potential of any alternative plan. AIG has taken too long already and we hope you come to the same conclusion.  Time is of the essence.  We look forward to engaging with management, the Board, and shareholders.

Sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Carl C. Icahn",8

15-10-28,"$NBG Thought's, Play and DD -- NASDAQ -- $0.87 -- 2 - 20 Day Play | 20% - 70%","Good Morning Everyone, 

I've come to you today to share a pick near and dear to my heart. $NBG. Yes, that's right, the National Bank of Greece. Unless you've been living under a rock for the last year; you've most likely heard about the financial mishap that occurred in Greece over the past few months, how it took their frail economy and smashed it on the ground; leaving the government and the EU to piece them back together….
Well… it’s been a few months since their decline, and, if you’ve looked at the charts, you can see, their [stock] has actually been doing quite well. Now… if you’re like me and decided not to join to fun because of negative sentiment; you’re probably wrong. 

**Financials**

Let’s take a quick peek at their Balance Sheet. Looking at their Annual Data’ as of January 1st, 2015 their Total Assets amounted to $131 billion… but… their Liabilities amounted to $128 billion, leaving their stockholder equity as $3 billion at their Net Tangible Assets at $240 million. It’s better than any other small-cap pharmaceutical company posted on this forum… right?
I hate to break it to y’all, but, their net income, yearly is -$1.4billion. Meaning their itsy bitsy $240million will last them, MAYBE a quarter… but that’s no reason to panic. 

**Let’s Look at Their Debt Consolidation**

In their [6-K]( http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1096061/000110465915070225/a15-21009_26k.htm) dating October 12th, 2015, they stated they will be 
  
&gt;[meeting] with potential investors within the context of evaluating alternative strategic options for financing.       

What does this mean to us? It means that most likely, the board of the National Bank of Greece is meeting with other countries, investors, exchanges and loaded corporations looking for low interest loans to keep them alive while they work out their financial problems. It’s a clear hint that the bank is NOT going to give up, will not go bankrupt and is willing to change their spending habits to keep them in business. It’s a strong indication that they have no interest in going under; after all, they are the largest bank in the country.    


So… They filed another [6-K](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1096061/000110465915071850/a15-21468_16k.htm) on October 21st which said, in essence:    


&gt;In Q2 they were up in excess of $1billion (+10.4% qoq) due to their trading gains.      
&gt;They **did** settle some of their non-performing loans, in-fact; a whole 0.3% of them, which, in fairness is $150 million.      
&gt;They received $27.6 billion in funding from the “Eurosystem”, a 7.8% qoq increase.    
&gt;Their total loan dollar amount was paid off, 1% of their loans were consolidated.     
&gt;We’re still looking for funding, please help us, we’re willing to change, please, please, please help us!    

__________________________________

**How does this effect the share price?**

Well… clearly people (investors) are willing to bail to bank out again, on the terms that the bank fixes its behaviour and that this financial collapse never happens again. This is positive news; as, it’s showing us (the NYSE investors) that they’re willing to raise the share price again.    
These negotiations are reflected in the share price, and, they have been reflected in the share price. If we look at the mere 1% debt consolidation that occurred on the 21st, the share price **skyrocketed** to just under $1.00. This consolidation was, as they said, one of many to come. If the aid keeps coming at this rate, we will continue to see these peaks and valleys in the share price, up to 20% swings; awesome for day trading, and, let me reiterate, I’m 99.9% sure we will continue to see these swing in the share price. 

**The Play &amp; Technical Analysis**

We’ll touch on the basic Technical Analysis. The stock’s RSI is hovering around 50… meaning it’s not oversold or not overbought. This is perfect for a stock. When we look at the resistance; it’s hovering around $0.92-$0.95. The support is clear at $0.82, this is the price I’d get in at. 

Throughout the day; NBG usually starts out strong, falls, and slowly rebounds; I’ve been playing it over the last week, until I got caught in at $0.92. What I go is buy at the end of the day and wait for the up-gap in the morning; usually it’s in excess of 10%. This is for people who want swing play; but for those who are looking for a longer play; I’ll explain that.  

I’d get in at $0.86 - $0.87, it’s probably not falling any lower than that, it’s only up from there. If you’re looking for a longer play; ideally hold on until they announce their financial state; most likely in 15-20 days. We could see a share price of $1.40+, not bad for a few weeks.   

I’m not setting a stop loss personally, I’ll **know** the share price is rising, because the bank is needed to rebound, it’s literally the embodiment of the Greek economy. If you want to set a stop loss, go ahead, I’m just telling you my play. I’ll day trade and hold on for a while, so; it’s up to you. 

Full Disclosure: I have 750,000 shares in NBG at an average of $0.9061, I plan on holding until $1.40, I don’t care how much it rallies, and I know we’ll see it. Resistance; currently is at $0.93ish, down from $0.96 the past week and the floor is around the current price. I’ll probably pick up about 100,000 shares a day to play the swings, but I’m busy the next week so probably not for the next little while. 

Enjoy!

15-10-27,"I've convinced the owner of the small company I work for (15-20ppl) to switch away from an expense-heavy Simple IRA to a new provider (I'm pushing for Vanguard)... Now what? How do you make the transition?","Looking for a little advice or guidance. I work for a small company with 15-20 employees. We currently have a Simple IRA through Putnam Investments and it's pretty abysmal when it comes to fees. 5.75% front load ""sales charge"" and the lowest expense ratios for funds are at about 1%, and those are few and far between. Target date funds go upwards of 4% expense ratios. There are only a handful (he alluded to maybe 6 employees) who contribute currently to the existing plan.

I pointed out to the owner how steep the fees are and that there are better options out there. I've been pushing Vanguard and Fidelity to him because of the no sales charges and low expense ratios. He genuinely cares and wants the best for all of us here, this is just not really in his wheelhouse and in trying to figure things out it just ends up with financial advisors making sales pitches of more of the same. 

We just got off the phone with an advisor from Wells Fargo who went through a long sales pitch of more of the same expense-heavy funds and charges. The call ended with ""Yeah, if you want to avoid fees and are fine how you currently are without much, if any, advice... Vanguard would be a great option for you."" But now it's like being back at square one. If I could come to the owner of the company with everything he needs to do, or even help him through the process I feel that we'd all be benefitting here at our company. 

Hopefully this is the right sub for this... If it's not, apologies and I'd love to be pointed in the right direction. Thanks!

15-10-28,How do I harvest loses for tax purpses?,"I have $300 (short term) in **realized** gains in my Roth IRA account. 

In a separate brokerage account, I have about $300 **unrealized** losses between AAPL and VBK (small cap growth).


I am a college student with marginal income. I expect to be in the 10% tax bracket entirely.

Now if I don't sell my loses, and I retain my net capital gain of $300 for 2015, that means I will be taxed 10% on that money because:

1. The earnings were short (sold within 1 year)
2. My income tax bracket is 10%, and since it was held for a short-term, I would be taxed on the capital gain at my income bracket rate, right?

Now say I sell the equity in my brokerage account and take the $300 short term loss. That means that I can deduct that $300 loss directly from my $300 capital gains, meaning I have a net capital gain of $0 and don't have to pay any tax, right? Meanwhile, I can take what is left from that sale and place it into a similar fund. Maybe I take the money from the AAPL sale and put it in a technology etf and the money from the VBK (small cap growth) sale and put it into VB (small cap) to maintain market exposure and avoid wash sales.

In the face of this, the stock has fallen about 40% in the last two weeks. This could either be the result of insider information that the drug will not be approved or that earnings are bad for this quarter, or it could be reflective of the bearish trend towards biotechs before the approval of a new drug. From what I understand of Androxal's trial results, it seems to be both safe and effective, and from what I understand of their financials, they are not in debt but they are leaking money. Analysts are predicting a lower than previous earnings for this quarter--but even still I'm not sure if that warrants the recent dropoff in stock price.

I might be missing something huge here, but it seems likely that at some point between now and Nov. 30, RPRX is going to bounce back. It is still going down each day, but the last few days it has gone down less and had periods during the day during which it is positive. It generally goes down and then up into positive during the morning and then down into the negative through the rest of the afternoon, so afternoon or when it's down in the morning would be best times to buy. I think I'm going to wait for them to get a positive day before I jump on board, but they have a potentially very long road upwards considering they are down about 40% on no news and could have good news rather soon.

They have spent $1.9bn on 14 software company acquisitions in the last 5 years and the stock today is worth $1.9bn total. They were worth $4bn before the acquisitions started. The problem is that 50% of revenue comes from Managed Print Services,  printers and toner, which attracts a certain type of cash flow &amp; dividend focused investor, and the other 50% of revenue is software based which attracts more speculative investors. The company believes it is heavily undervalued in the markets and hopes to ""Unlock Value"" by going private or selling outright to a competitor. 

On the announcement the stock jumped 7% but then the following day they announced results which were shit. This pushed it back down 12%. 

I bought call options that expire in January and April at $36 and $40 strikes respectively. The share price today is $33

If any deal closes or looks close by then a 33% premium over the current market price will deliver a 12x return on the options. A 50% premium would deliver 25x return.

&gt; * Current 0 - 0.25% for federal funds rate remains appropriate.

&gt; * Whether to raise federal funds rate at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress toward its objectives of maximum employment &amp; 2% inflation. Taking into account: labor market conditions, inflation pressures, inflation expectations, &amp; financial and international developments.

&gt; * It will be appropriate to raise federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market &amp; is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2% objective over the medium term.

&gt; * Even after employment &amp; inflation are near mandate consistent levels, economic conditions may warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

15-10-29,Apple Should Buy a University,"Apple has more than $205 billion in cash. What should they do with the money? Apple should buy a university and rebuild it from the ground up.

In recent years, some private equity firms have bought universities and turned them into for-profits. 

Apple is a for-profit corporation not a charity but there are plenty of ways to make money from a non-profit university. Aside from the tax breaks and other deductions, Apple University would be a proving ground for educational technologies that would be sold to every other university in the world. New textbooks built for the iPad and its successors would greatly increase the demand for iPads. Apple-designed courses built using online technologies, a.i. tutors, and virtual reality experimental worlds could become the leading form of education worldwide. Big data analytics from Apple University textbooks and courses would lead to new and better ways of teaching. 

As a new university, Apple could experiment with new ways of organizing degrees and departments and certifying knowledge. Campuses in Delhi, Seoul, Shanghai, Berlin, and Sao Paulo could provide opportunities for studying abroad. Apple’s reputation would attract top students, especially, for example, if it started with a design and business school. Top students would lead Apple University to be highly ranked. The more prestigious Apple University became the greater would be the demand for Apple University educational products.

Apple already has the beginning of this model with iTunes U and its own internal Apple University for training in business and design. By buying a university, Apple would commit to a learning process to develop these technologies in entirely new ways.

Not to mention they are a paying customer thank you very much. Plus they recently bought a used-car sales [website,] (http://www.thedomains.com/2015/08/13/autobytel-buys-dealix-owner-of-usedcars-com-in-25-million-deal/) allowing them to close the loop with their existing new-car. This nearly doubles their market exposure, allowing them get  the trade-ins of used cars as part of the buying of new cars. The domain itsself, ""usedcars.com"" reduces their dependence on Google, as does their other acquisition of [AutoWeb] (http://finance.yahoo.com/news/autobytel-acquires-autoweb-stock-transaction-201744029.html).

And fucking PE at 60? Are you fucking kidding me? The PEG was at 2.32 i.e. cheap as fuck for a growth company.

15-10-30,NPXI Drops ~20% on decent Q3 ER. Am I missing something here?,"I was looking through the QQQ holding tonight looking for a play for tomorrow when I ran across NXPI. They had Q3 ER today and their price dropped ~20%. They beat estimated EPS for this quarter. EPS is up by over 200% same quarter last year. They have a pending merger thats likely to go through which will boost the value of the company. 

My current strategy has been to find strong companies that close below the lower bollinger band (10 instances, 1.5 SD) on a 3 month daily chart. If they open below the BB the next day buy stock or options. This should get me in at a good buying price and most strong companies bounce back based on back testing I've seen on the strategy. I sell the next day if it pops or within 20 days if it doesnt.

NXPI closed way below their lower BB today and will likely open below it too. I'm thinking about buying a few Nov $76 calls. 

Am I missing something here thats going to make this turn into a disaster?

There's something that's puzzling me.  A friend owns shares of ""The Humana Unitized Stock Fund"" (HUMSTKFD), available as part of their retirement plan.  [According to the prospectus](http://www.schwabplan.com/FundDetail/HUMSTKFD.pdf), it ""will normally be invested 
approximately 97.5 to 98.5 percent in Humana common stock and 1.5 to 2.5 percent in short term, interest-bearing money market funds. ""

Now, from from close of market on 10/23, the share price of Humana common stock (HUM) was 168.20.  As of close 10/27, the price was 175.16, for a net increase of $6.96 per share during that time period.  Now, the Humana Stock Fund went from $60.57 on close of 10/23 to $63.01 on close of 10/27, for a net increase of $2.44.  

If the fund is composed almost entirely of Humana Common stock (HUM), then the NAV increased as a result of the common stock share price increase.  Why isn't there a proportional increase in the share price of the HUMSTKFD fund?  In other words, how can HUM go up $6.96, but have the HUMSTKFD go up only $2.44?

15-10-29,Lam Research (LRCX) Acquisition of KLA Tencor (KLAC) Concern,"It seems as though Lam has been one of the hot picks in the semiconductor industry since the announcement of its acquisition of KLA Tencor. With AMAT declining, the company is likely poised to challenge for the #1 spot in the semiconductor equipment and materials subset of semiconductors. As Lam and KLA service the same clients, but at different stages of the manufacturing process, the deal expands the breadth of Lam's product line while utilizing already-in-place customer relations and supply routes.

That being said, I'm incredibly concerned with their new debt levels after the deal goes through. While Lam's debt position was favorable before the acquisition (around $1.9B in debt with $4.33B in cash and shareholder equity value of $5.1B), KLAC raised $2.75B in debt for a special dividend a year ago, which puts their total debt around $3.2B. This lowered their shareholder equity value to a pitiful $421M, and their $2.27B in cash, while significant, is not favorable by comparison. Lam guaranteed all of the senior notes owned by KLAC, so this debt is transferable, correct? All of this would be manageable were it not for the financing of the acquisition. Lam is financing the move through $1.9B in cash (cancelling out all but $370M of cash gained from KLAC) and $3.9B in debt raised. Post-merger, Lam will have around $4.5B in cash, and a whopping $9B in debt. Assuming Lam only transfers assets and the aforementioned LT debt from KLA Tencor (not acquiring KLAs other liabilities), the combined company's shareholder equity value could be well under $1B. For a company with a market cap of 12B, $9B in debt with a shareholder equity value under $1B is concerning, although the $4.5B in cash is attractive. 

Can anyone shed any light on my thought process here? Am I missing something? Perhaps LRCX guaranteeing the senior notes of KLAC doesn't mean the entire debt schedule of KLA Tencor transfers? Or are analysts simply not worried about those debt levels? I've had trouble finding anyone with negative views.",2

15-10-29,"Applying periodic income to Shiller PE and ""you can't time the market""","I'm wondering if any has seen any resources/back-tests of Shiller's PE ratio that include the fact that our income is not static (IE. I don't start at Day 0 with X cash and just have X + market returns to invest into the market -- I also have ""market-free"" periodic income = my job that I decide what to do with).

&amp;nbsp;

I've read some back-tests of Shiller PE and I understand that the main conclusion is although a useful metric, you can't use it to purely time the market, and buy &amp; hold usually wins out in total return over a long period of time versus entry/exit strategies using Shiller PE thresholds. However, I'm not clear whether these back-tests take into account periodic income from your job.

&amp;nbsp;

It seems to me that to get the best of both worlds, if you have a long time horizon and are holding relatively conservative total market funds, you should hold these, even when the US market plunges, yet you should not feed additional money into the market when Shiller PE is high. However, it's unclear to me whether this is actually a non-intuitive fallacy, and that given a long time horizon, you're better off continually feeding money into the market. Obviously, this strategy would not allow you to beat the market, but I'm just curious if there's been any consideration of this.",1

If the trend is my friend then how come it only shows up 30% of the time? What kind of friend is that? Call me stupid, but I don't want a friend like that.. In trading you have to learn about more than trends in order to survive.. The market is always trying to screw you over and trap you so you have to become aware of this.. There are 7 main things the market is trying to do constantly. Maybe not every single day on one instrument, but you will see it throughout the whole market.. And this is one of the reasons why the market is hard to trade because the market doesn't act the same everyday...

The 7 things are 1) short/long squeeze (fake trends), 2) consolidation, 3) range, 4)strong trends, 5) semi trends, 6) breakouts, and 7) reverses... I'm too lazy to explain every single one of these so you will have to study them yourself.

The market loves to trick you into believing that your ONE system is going to make you money.. And then 3 months from now your ONE system is going to stop working and I wonder why? Is it because you was trading a trendy market and now it's not trending.

Now, I'm not here to beat down trends because you can make a lot of money from them if you know how to hold onto winners.. But the real trends only appear 30% of the time.. Most people get confused and think that a temporary direction is a trend.. But real trends last for the whole day.",0

15-10-29,Whats with all the hate on GoDaddy?,"GoDaddy (Ticker: GDDY)

Founded in 1997 and currently boasting over 60 million domains, GoDaddy is the clear market leader in the domain registry space by a large margin. The company was taken private via an LBO in 2011, in 2014 there was a 350mm dividend recap and then it finally IPO'd on April first. Expected price range was $17-$19, the stock opened at $20, and rose almost 31% to close at $26.15. 

GoDaddy's domain business is its bread and butter, and then it also has hosting and presence services and business apps. The hosting and presence services and business apps segments are not only growing extremely quickly, but they also have much better margins than the main domain business which will result in overall margin expansion for the company over time.

GoDaddy's domain business is the main customer acquisition vehicle, and then from there customers tend to purchase other services. The company's main target customer are new businesses trying to gain an online presence and join the e-commerce wave, and small businesses that already have an online presence but want to streamline it or make it better. A major catalyst for the company is international expansion. International revenues currently make up 25% of total revenue, up from below 20% just a few years ago. GoDaddy since 2012 has also been custom tailoring its product offering to the various market it services. This is to say they are offering their product in a countries language, having a dedicated customer service team in that country, etc. GoDaddy has also been growing inorganically through small tech acquisitions to help the company bolster its product offerings. 

I don't understand why everyone is hating so much on GoDaddy. The company has extremely stable revenues due to its subscription based services and deferred revenue recognition, and subsequent negative operating working capital. Top-line growth beat expectations last quarter but the stock dropped because its net income missed expectations. The company is obviously investing heavily in itself to get further ahead of its competitors, and it can do so safely because it knows it will have revenues coming in as the deferred revenues are recognized over time. People often cite that GoDaddy has had a net loss since 2009, but totally ignore the fact that it has been cash flow positive on an adjusted EBITDA basis. If GoDaddy really had profitability issues then it wouldn't have been taken private in LBO because it wouldn't have survived it. Other cite the large debt load as a concern, but then don't realize the bulk of it doesn't mature until 2021 and even then has relatively low interest expense. Another major concern cited is that its domain business has no barriers to entry and large tech behemoths like Google and Amazon have entered the cloud space. The thing about the domain business is that its a relatively common service but theres vast disparities in prices offered. None of Google or Amazons or any other major competitors have prices anywhere close to the prices that GoDaddy offers. GoDaddy is essentially the Walmart of domain names.

FYI GoDaddy posts earnings on Nov 4 after market close.

So please, why all the hate on GoDaddy?",0

First off let me state a few things. This company is legit, it is a mining company, I have been to the mine, the land is privately owned, it is very high-tech and progressive, another much larger company is trying to leverage 53% ownership as I am writing this, and currently they are waiting for DEQ approval to open one of the largest mines in the world of this kind.

Here is my dilemna: I have no experience in mining companies, and this is a penny stock. I sincerely believe the DEQ will approve this mine, and after a few years of lawsuits from environmentalists, I am sure this area will be mined. There is A LOT of minerals in the ground. Research indicates that it is the second highest grade of this mineral in the world.

15-10-29,"Trying to make it full-time trading. Questions about incorporating, IRS designation as ""trader"", etc.","I trade from home; I've beaten the market for over a decade; this is the first year I've attempted to do it for my sole income. If I can make a livable wage for 8 years until my IRA opens up I'll be content. 

Essentially I have no capital expenses (outside of investment capital), and the room in my house I could designate as ""office space"" is fairly inconsequential. I have no liabilities to protect. I am not interested in selling shares to others; the requisite BoD can be filled with trivially-paid friends.

Right now I'm facing some capital losses from the summer's Greece+China setbacks, which *may* extend to year-end (could go either way). Nothing to do about that, but it's a lesson learned about capital losses and taxes; or rather: how best to handle such capital losses?

So, my lawyer (who is NOT a tax/corp specialist) advises strongly against incorporating outside of my state (PA). She wants me to incorp as an LLC. Everything online suggests I should incorporate in either DE or NV, and as a Corp-C.

My options are:

1. Do nothing. File as unemployed, and pay normal short-term and long-term cap gains taxes.

2. Attempt to get ""trader"" designation with the IRS, which is apparently non-trivial, and that apparently will change how my investment capital losses are handled.

3. Incorporate, and pay myself a salary high enough to pay bills, plus more as things improve. Suboptions here:

* 3.1 Incorporate in PA as LLC, per my lawyer. She's going to research a case she had where she had to move an LLC from DE to PA, to better explain the problems they faced.

* 3.2 Incorporate in DE. Advantages: no in-state income tax, at least). What other (dis)advantages are there?

* 3.3 Incorporate in NV. No in-state income tax, and apparently easier corporate reporting in NV. What other (dis)advantages are there?

* 3.4 Incorporate elsewhere. Why?

Thanks for all your thoughts.

* But all i have done is look at the earnings report calender for the next day, choose 4 or 5 stocks with the highest consensus EPS (and a lower cost than $100 a share), buy about 10K (150-200ish shares) worth of those companies shares.

* So  say I buy around 30K worth of shares in 3 stocks in a night, then when they relase their earnings report the next day, the share price goes up and I sell for a few hundrd dollar profit. Two stocks shot up $7 dollars the next day, which accounted for a lot of my earnings.

Is it this unusual? Have I just been very lucky? I have yet to lose money on any stock, and I have bought (and sold) about 12ish different stocks all for big profit. As long as I keep going of the EPS, what could go wrong? Unless the experts are just totally wrong one day.

15-10-31,Weird options glitch on Investopedia,"I recently got into investopedia's stock simulator and I've noticed a baffling glitch that occurs in some of the options.

Seemingly random options with high strike prices in January 2016 or later have a bid price of exactly $57.00. This means users can buy the maximum volume of options at the market price of $0.01 and immediately sell them back into the market for the price of $57.00. This has allowed me to turn $100,000 into over $100,000,000 in two days. Obviously this is a bug in investopedia's system; when I search the glitched options on nasdaq, the ask price matches investopedia's but there simply isn't a bid price (this makes sense since the the strike price is so high). 

I was wondering if anyone else had any experience with this glitch and could help me fully exploit it. It seems to be predictable and it's definitely the main way people make big money on investopedia. I've tried finding an explanation myself but the only pattern I've seen is the bid price of $57.00. How is it that the top ranked players know exactly which companies will have the highest number of glitched options?",0

15-10-30,I am an idiot. Please help me not be an idiot anymore.,"I have a bit of a cringeworthy story about my first 2 months in the stock market. I asked one of the mods if it would be ok to post here and they thought it would be good for this sub. A little entertainment for the weekend. Keep in mind I am a college student, that saved about $7k over the summer. Ok, here we go:

I made a very dumb choice. One of the worst any new investor could make. I decided to start my investing experience in penny stocks.

It all started back in Aug. after the ""crash"". It seemed like a great time to get in. I checked a few subreddits and came across NETE (I'm still not sure exactly what they even do. Something about mobile payments.) It was all good for the first few weeks and I learned the basics to the stock market. However, I was down by about 5% but only had $200 in so no big sweat, right? Well I thought I was ready for real money (Biggest mistake of my life), so I invested $1300 more in it to cover my losses. This was money I already planned on investing. 

Later that week I lost another 10%, price just dropped out of no where. Strange, but I wasn't too worried. The pumpers set my mind at ease and told me it would recover soon, so average down. After a few days there was no news looming, except a some insider investing and a pending SEC filing. So I thought, what the hell. Cant hurt to throw another $1000 at it. 10% up and I'll cover my losses and then some. The next day, it was announced that they were filling for reverse split and wanted to vote in a few months on it. Literally drove my portfolio down another about 10% in a day. I died a little inside but I accepted defeat. 

While all this is going on I did happen to make a little money on the side with GBSN. $20 here, $40 there. So I decided to move my money there so I could make $200 here, $400 there. I was even more confident since, they just released some news that customer acquisition was up and the only thing against them were some outstanding warrants. But it seemed as though the warrants already drove the price down as much as it could go, so I was in a good place. 

I got in with about $800 at 0.08 and watched it go to 0.10, cool beans right? Wrong again. I was invest investing in GBSN in increments to get the best average price possible. And had about $500 left so I got the bright idea out of thin air to YOLO my money in RXII because it was up about 0.10 that day and reached about 0.60 (mind you I had only over this stock on my Robinhood watch list a couple times). I thought I was catching it on a swing down since it dropped down to 0.55. I was going to ride it back up to 0.60 and get out. Well it went up to about 0.56 and just went down after that. For the rest of the day it lingered around 0.53-0.54 and then dropped down to 0.48 the next day. It was like the universe decided to hit me over the head with a sludge hammer and flip me off. I came to find out the price fell all because some penny stock alert told a bunch of people to pull out. 

So at this point I'm in dumbfounded in complete awe. I didn't even make much money on GBSN because it was countered by RXII. Angered, I decided to stick with my original plan and pull out of GBSN (@ 0.09) and RXII (@ 0.48) and buy back in on the next swing down to .08. It usually made it back up to 0.09 some time in the week so it seemed like a quick trade. I put **another** $1000 and bought back in @ .083. Well the SAME DAY., Nasdaq issued a delisting warning for GBSN and the price dropped lower than my IQ. Over the next couple of days it went all the way down to 0.06 and I decided I had enough. I finally got out at .059. After a few days of thinking I had it all settled, I decided I would get back in GBSN at .045 and ride the wave back up to at least .07. So I sold on Monday and waited for all of my money to clear, on Thursday so I could get back in and the price should be 0.05 or lower. Well just to my luck, Wednesday it went down to like .051 and shot up over 30% to like .07. I died a little more inside. I had to sit there and watch my brilliant plan go to shit while I'm sitting in class taking a test (teacher was sleep). 

I woke up thursday morning and saw it was down for a bit but then jumped back up to like 0.075 so I got back in on a swing down to 0.072. It went back up to  0.075 but I just knew it was gonna go higher. Well it didnt. I literally went down to 0.07-0.0718 and stayed in that range for about 2hrs. I set my stop loss @ 0.0675 when I saw it drop break below 0.07 for the first time. It bounced between 0.068-0.071 but about an hour later it sold my position and GBSN was dropping ever since. At that moment I told myself I was done gambling like a bafoon and deleted all the penny stocks in my watchlist. I added Bank of America, Apple, Nokia, Netflix, and Ford to take their places. I had been watching these on and off for a while and doing a little dd on them.

**Tl;Dr**: Wanted a check, got REKT.

A message to new investors. Stay out of penny stocks! For now at least. It can be a great way to make a lot of money, when you know what you're doing. And you are probably smarter than me, but its a whole different beast than your standard day trading. They need CONSTANT attention. I spent most of my class periods and work hours glued to my phone, trying to make sure I didn't lose too much at once. Still got destroyed anyway.

Right now I have about $3100. I will not be adding any more in the see able future. I am tired of making idiotic decisions and want to turn my portfolio around. Please help me:

* How do you properly do DD? (List the things I should know before making any type of investment)

* How long should I watch a stock before getting in?

* What catalyst are most influential in affecting a stock's price?

* Are there any other suggestions on how to properly invest?

**EDIT**: Ok so a lot of people are stating ""Hey, you were just gambling. You need to change you're mindset if you want to ever make any money. Stop investing in penny stocks"" Thank you. I get it. I knew I was really just gambling instead of investing and wanted to change that. 1) The point of this is to warn others not to follow my mistakes, 2) Get some advice on how to change, 3) Give you guys a good story to laugh at. 

**Edit 2**: I forgot to mention this, STAY THE HELL AWAY FORM STOCKTWITS. Especially if you do decide to get into penny stocks. It is literally ALL pumpers. No one listens to the bears and calls them crazy. You won't have a clear understanding of a company if all you listen to is the good?

**Edit 3**: Now I keep hearing people say I lost half my money and would have to double my current position to get it back in 6 months. 1) I didn't lose half of my money $1500+$3100=$4600. I don't have to double my money I to get it back. What I lost is about half of what I have seculeded   right now for future investments. But honestly Im only focusing on a $1000 since I set that as my goal. 2) Im not expecting to make it back in exactly 6 months from today. I said 6 months to a year but I'm leaning closer to a year. And this is only after I believe I'm ready to get back in. Which may be awhile from now. Sorry about the miscommunication there

Just remembered something funny. My cousin was trying to me into the forex market and I thought I was going to take the easy way out with the stock market. One one hand the stock market is still not child's play and I underestimated it. On the other hand forex trading would have bankrupted me in days.",95

15-10-30,GBLI is a small cap stock with enormous upside and limited downside,"GBLI increased its book value per share by over 30% yesterday and no one noticed.  The company is repurchasing the shares from its largest shareholder, a private equity fund, at a 15% discount to market and a 35% discount to tangible book value.  Critically, GP of the PE fund and GBLI's controlling shareholder is staying in.  The company's book value per share will increase to $47.  It's trading at $28.  Liquidation value (its assets are primarily AA bonds so easily sold; my analysis shows liabilities potentially overstated) is mid-$40s.  If book value grows 7% a year as it has been doing even in this interest rate environment, book value becomes $65/share in five years.  The company can easily trade at 1.0x - 1.5x book value.  So the long-term upside is several turns and the fundamental downside is non-existent.  Someone will notice the transaction eventually, so the shares will rise in the short-term as well.

Does it mean the Fed isn't as worried as it once was about a possible economic slowdown? I think the FOMC is trying to downplay the role of global economic gloom may have on its decision and refocus on inflation and labor - its two mandates.
The Fed mentioned December as a possible timing to raise rates: The Fed only stated, as it should have, the following:
""In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress--both realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation""
So if the labor market and inflation doesn't deviate by much from its current trajectory, the Fed is more likely to raise rates.",2

Right now, I own T stock. I primarily own it for what I consider to be a safer dividend. However, I'm getting nervous about having too much exposure to them as an individual stock in my portfolio. My holding in T is about 9% of my portfolio. I also have extra exposure to T through USMV and ITOT. Would it be stupid to sell my T holdings and spread them out through my other holdings? Would it even be a smart idea to replace my T holdings with PFF which has a very similar payout but more diversified? ",1
15-10-30,The difference between investing and gambling,"Peter Lynch once said, “When people discover they are no good as baseball or hockey, they put away their bats and their skates and they take up amateur golf or stamp collecting or gardening. But when people discover they are no good at picking stocks, they are likely to continue to do it anyway.”

In traditional sports, it’s easy to measure if you are good based on batting average, goals scored, or other statistics.

In the stock market, some investors seem to believe their next great stock idea will be the big winner that makes up for all of their losers. The question every investor needs to answer is…are you investing or gambling?

What is Investing?

According to one definition, investing is, “the act of committing money or capital to an endeavor with the expectation of obtaining additional income or profit.” What this definition lacks is the real difference between investing and gambling…research.

Unfortunately, there is a huge crowd of amateur investors that ignore Peter Lynch’s sound advice, “a share is not a lottery ticket…it’s part ownership of a business.”

Many “investors” think investing in the stock market is like walking into a casino. They throw money at a stock, or a basket of stocks, based on a rumor, tip, or something they believe. They do very little research (if any) into each company, and many times, they lose just like at a casino.

For the amount of “investing” they are doing, they may as well have gone to Atlantic City and bet on number 13 at the roulette wheel.

While gambling involves random chance, investing requires some research. Lest anyone get intimidated, this type of research doesn’t require a PhD, and in some cases can be done in a short amount of time.

If you are interested in a company, the first place many real investors should go is the company’s most recent quarterly report. Beyond this, analyzing things like the company’s last annual report, balance sheet, cash flow statement, and income statement can be instructive.

More thorough research, might involve reading the company’s last few conference call transcripts, and even calling the company to ask questions.

Finally, the investor might look at some valuation comparisons of the stock compared to its industry peers, or historical norms. Unlike pulling the handle on a slot machine, in the stock market, a little bit of research can increase your chances of making money significantly.

Timing is Everything…or is it?

An additional hurdle that many investors must try to overcome is the idea that some people are born market timers. The truth is, there is no such thing as an investor who is consistently great at timing the market.

Investors do their research, and attempt to pay a fair valuation based on their assumptions. Real investors ignore the market and focus on the company.

A few case studies are instructive, to show how an investor can either make or lose a lot of money by trying to time the market. First, let’s say you believed in October 2011, that Netflix was going to be the king of online video.

The stock was valued at a split-adjusted price of around $12 a share. You decided to invest $10,000, and purchased 832 shares. Today, that $10,000 investment is worth more than $80,000, or an annual rate of return of just under 70%.

However, let’s say you decided to buy into Netflix a bit earlier in July 2011. With the same conviction as the first investor, you bought shares when they were at $42.16.

Just a year later, you get nervous because you’re losing money. Rather than focusing on the company, you abandon your investment a year later at $8.42 a share, a negative 34% annual rate of return.

The difference between the investor who made a huge profit in Netflix, and the one who suffered significant losses was patience and conviction. Netflix’s financial and operating profile didn’t change, the stock market simply mispriced the opportunity in 2012.

Gambling Poker CardsREUTERS/Jean-Philippe Arles
A blackjack dealer pays out a winner.

In the second scenario, an investor decided that Keurig Green Mountain would change the coffee industry forever. In October 2011, the company’s stock was around $71 a share, and this investor chose to buy $10,000 worth.

That same investor has been on a wild ride over the last few years, and has witnessed their investment decline to about $7,800. With an annual rate of return of negative 6%, the company has some challenges and the market seems to be pricing these issues accordingly.

That being said, an investor in December 2010, might have thought that Green Mountain was a great company as well. With the stock at $32.50 a share, the investor decided to buy. Just nine months later, Green Mountain’s stock was riding high at $108, and the short-term investor sells out with an annual rate of return of nearly 400%. This investor might believe that Green Mountain is one of the best investments they ever made.

The Answer

The point is, in the short-term, a stock can move up or down without correlation to the strength of the business. Over the long-term, investors might experience volatility, as stocks move based on supply and demand – not necessarily intrinsic value.

The bottom line is, if you’re a gambler you’re probably better off taking some of your money and having fun in Las Vegas. Hopefully you’ll have enough left to take your serious money, and put it in the hands of a qualified financial advisor.

However, if you’re interested in becoming a better investor, do some research into the company or companies you are interested in. When you’ve decided to put your money to work, make sure you keep up with the story and buy or sell based on the strength of the business.

Sometimes, the difference between gambling and investing is a little bit of research, and the stomach to stick to your playbook.",0

I have been investing for ~5 years and would consider myself an advanced amateur. I have read all the investor classics together with several books on accounting and valuation. I would consider my current level of analysis-skill at least worthy of being published on Seeking Alpha. I have three years left of my master's degree in finance and I have a dream of being able to do professional-level research BEFORE I enter the industry. I want to be so good that I can't be ignored by a future employer. 

 My questions to you guys are: How do I go about doing this? What is it that really seperates ""Seeking Alpha worthy research"" from ""professional sell/buy side research""? Should I start to specialize in a niche or is it too early? Which books should I read? Would advanced accounting be beneficial or can I get by with intermediate level? Etc.

15-10-31,"Critique novice starting point, or what would you have done differently?","Crossposting from /options because WSB rules. 

I'm a novice asking for critique. What would you have done differently when you started out?  

The goal is grow a small (5k) beginning account part-time over the next year+.  Will in invest in active learning with real $ and real trades, at risk-managed amounts, only supplementing with books, forums, ""experts"", etc. No regrets, only learning. 

Want to ultimately develop a barbell portfolio =  a % of $ in safe investments and % of $ in Yolos (not sure what the %’s are, yet). 

As a novice I can't know where to stand on fundamentals vs TA, but I want to develop basics in both. Context (fundies) &amp; content (TA) both seem important... one for value (which equity?), the other for time (when to trade?). At this early stage I know nothing, but it does seem axiomatic to develop an instinct to see and capitalize on trends (otherwise why trade options?) knowing that my ability to navigate the continuum of market unpredictability and human fallibility will not remain static. 

Goal: Devise a set of approx 6-8 liquid trend targets with respective bullish or bearish strategies, and set up analysis and alert system for when to trade. 

**CHOOSE EQUITY**

+ Finviz for liquidity of at least 100k vol and 500 trades per contract (higher implied volatility = timeline in and strike closer to the $)
+ Look for high volume, but also climactic volume
+ Look at short interest
+ Know essentials of what equity is/does
+ Overbought/sold? Hmm.
+ See external trends (product, earnings, news). 

Question: What do you find most critical in choosing what to option?

**ANALYZE:**
Add equities to simple Trend Analysis:

* check chart basics: gaps, wedges, support/resistance, etc…
* create a set of custom text alert indicators in TOS for when moving averages cross.
* look up daily close candlestick indicators

Welcome input in what basic TA a novice should master. I'm instinctively drawn to MA's and candlesticks but I don't have a phd in Ukranian mathematics. 

**MAKE THE TRADE:**

* Strategy appropriate to trend assumptions and probability... keep it simple
* Daily monitoring
* No regrets, only learning

**EVOLVE A LIST OF RULES:**

* know what I don’t yet know (the list grows)
* aim for simplicity = balanced portfolio &amp; strategies
* determine position % minimums based on low vs high risk
* only sell puts in stock I want to own
* don’t trade without basic exit strategy
* use a trade journal w/ pre and post trade notes

All obviously a novice starting point -- looking for input on what else to consider, or what you would have done differently.

15-10-30,How can I profit from the impending collapse of the tech bubble/US economy?,"Here is my half-baked theory so far: The unicorn techs are all overvalued and burning through VC money as most are subsidizing customers (read: losing money on every transaction) just to gain market share. VC's and investors are betting on the future profits of these companies. Eventually the bubble will burst when investors realize these company valuations are purely based future hypothetical earnings and not actual profitability. This will have far reaching effects on other industries, for example Real Estate. The real estate market in the Bay Area is hugely propped up by the tech industry. Tech employees can pay the exorbitant rents ($4,000 to rent a 1-bedroom apartment) and their companies can pay $80-$100 per square foot for office space. Tech companies also lease more space than they need to prepare for future hiring. Once these tech companies fail, office vacancy will skyrocket, office rents will drop, and the values of office buildings (which are driven by a multiple of rental income) will collapse. Demand for apartments will collapse as employees are laid off and cannot afford the high asking rents, and vacancy will jump. Apartment values (also driven by a multiple of rental income) will collapse as well.  Single family homes will collapse in value. Other industries will surely be devastated as well.

I am 22, a student, and am looking to make a long term investment. I can hold this stock for 5-10+ years and just wanted to see what you guys/girls thought. I have 5k to invest and was thinking about putting it in Apple or tesla. They seem like 2 solid companies. I do have my worries about Apple being artificially inflated by buyers right now, buying into Apple because it will ""always"" go up. If there was any type of share holder scare I fear that the price of Apple stock would crumble. Maybe this is just personal speculation but the market is a gamble and no one really knows anything for sure. This makes me lean toward tesla. With an innovator like Elon I could see them doing a lot more growing in the future and the price is relatively low right now. But what do you guys think? Am I being over paranoid?

So I'm trying to decide how to allocate between ""value"", ""growth"", ""midcap"" etc. 

I am putting around $1000-$1500 a month right now split every 2 weeks and the way I am allowed to allocate it is: transfer all existing money, transfer future money only, transfer existing money and future money, etc. basically I just make percentages that equal 100.

Right now I just started so I've only got about 7 grand so the way I allocate is change the ""future money only"" feature because it still has a big impact on my total portfolio and if I chose to transfer money out of an existing fund, I can't buy back into that for 60 days. So right now I guess you could say I'm gambling with various index funds but the more money I get in there makes it so future money only option has less of an impact if you follow me.

How would you allocate options like this? I'm pretty set on index funds but confused on how I should swap the different types around once I'm up to say 50 or 100 grand.
