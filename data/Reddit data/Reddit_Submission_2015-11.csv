15-11-01,"[Noob question] Can someone ""explain"" extreme drops in stocks?","So I've been investing successfully for the last few years. I've been making around 20% a year so far which is awesome.

I found this subreddit recently and have found the content really interesting, so firstly, thanks!

I saw a post about western digital and took a look at their stock price graph. I noticed around mid-1997 their stock price was trading at around 53, then a year later it crashed to around 11. I know sometimes stocks can fluctuate based on performance, but such an extreme change?
 
It worries me because I have around £5000 invested at this point and the thought of losing a large chunk of that is quite worrying. I guess my question is how random are events like this? I understand if a stock is overvalued and people lose faith in it it can lose a lot of value, but such an extreme drop seems odd. For example, I have Tesla stock and recently after they announced slightly disappointing performance the stock price dropped quite a bit, but no where near the drop in price of western digital.

Sorry for the super noob question.",2

15-11-01,Valeant Pharma (VRX) - Some notes I have taken,"Here are some notes I took yesterday

I have considered starting a position in the company based on ownership by Sequoia, ValueAct and Pershing (Ackman). Pershing is in the midst of a long conference call on the subject. I believe it has already passed the 4 hour mark. Sequoia sent a note out the other day to their investors that the short report by Citron was flawed. Yet, we now see subsequently that Philidor was and is an issue. 

Two board members of Sequoia did resign yesterday. The Wall Street Journal reported, “had raised concerns in recent months about whether Sequoia should have such a large position in the embattled pharmaceutical company.”

Valeant has been accused of being a fraud like company via a report from Citron a few weeks back. Many accused this report to be biased and merely a short attempt to profit off of a falling stock price. Yet, the report discussed Valeant’s relationship with Philidor, and today Valeant announced they will no longer do business with Philidor. 

In today’s Pershing Conference Call Ackman said, “Valeant's shares are now at an extraordinarily low price."" Pershing Square boosted its Valeant investment by 2 million shares last week, and Ackman said he would have bought more if he had more capital. 

Morningstar rates the credit as a ‘BB’ with debt to assets of 63.74%.

“Under the control of CEO J. Michael Pearson, Valeant's aggressive acquisition strategy has been executed nearly flawlessly, but recent concerns over the company's aggressive use of specialty pharmacies has tarnished the company's image. Pearson's highly accretive acquisitions have significantly reduced the firm's patent exposure, refocused the business on attractive pharmaceutical markets, and drastically improved margins. Despite the stock's terrific run since Pearson took over, Valeant's questionable relationship with specialty pharmacies, especially Philidor, has raised concerns over wrongdoing and weak internal controls. These concerns, combined with Valeant's high debt level, have placed the company under severe pressure, but we think new product launches and improving cash flow in 2016 should begin to clean up the company's financial position as long as the 7% of sales affected by specialty pharmacies doesn't lead to further issues in the remainder of the business.”  Morningstar 10/30/15

""“Valeant has disclosed that it is closely involved with a pharmacy called Philidor Rx, and that Philidor has relationships with several other small pharmacies. These pharmacies dispense Valeant prescriptions to dermatology patients. Valeant says the inventory held by these pharmacies remains on Valeant’s books until the product is shipped to a patient. If Valeant were recording phantom sales, as alleged in the Citron Research report, we would expect its accounts receivable would be growing out of proportion to overall sales growth and its cash flow would be poor. Instead, Valeant’s accounts receivable growth has been in line with overall sales growth for the first nine months of the year, both up about 30%. Cash flow conversion has been in line with expectations.”

 I think if a company were hiding cash flows, they could increase Goodwill or another asset, and hence, not necessarily evident via Accounts Receivable. 

Other quick Mentions:

Charlie Munger has implied that Valeant is destined to fail big time. 

Here is an Enron page I keep with old bullish sell side reports in full.  http://rbcpa.com/enron.html  

Valeant ends relationship w/ Philidor.  VRX paid $100M to buy Philidor for $0. Doesn't VRX really own them?  Is Valeant jerking us off?

Ackman CC says credit rating improvement could raise stock price.  S&amp;P downgraded VRX credit yesterday to B+ from BB- outlook negative.",5

15-11-01,Risks To The Micron Long Thesis,"I have just sold all my RAD holdings. If the buyout goes through I could have gotten a higher price, but that would take a while. I don't see any rival white knights on the horizon to compete for RAD and force the buyout price higher. CVS would probably not be approved by regulators. The same applies to acquirers based overseas. Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and other superstores might hesitate to buy a company with this much debt unless they were very familiar with integration of the business. Walgreens was always the logical choice for a merger, but after they bought Boots I had thought they would be too highly leveraged to consider further acquisitions soon.

If the buyout does not go through, I would expect RAD's stock price to fall, recovering next quarter if profitability increases due to growth of the EnvisionRx portion -- assuming that growth materializes.

I may trade around the current RAD price level, because I think it is not far from a floor at this point, although if the Fed raises interest rates in December the floor might be lower. RAD has been a good stock for trading for quite a while, and that is likely to continue as long as a fixed price buyout remains unresolved.",0

Even though the S&amp;amp;P 500 is about 2,5% off its May 2015 record of 2134, due to Q3 earnings being lower than last year's, the index's P/E multiple has continued to expand.

Note: When I say 16-year high, I'm intentionally excluding recessions, when P/Es become distorted and are no longer meaningful. The S&amp;amp;P P/E was ~120 in Apr 2009 because heavy one-time losses were reflected in the ""E.""

In the current bull market, the S&amp;amp;P P/E has been expanding by about 2x every year:

- 2014/12: ~20x
- 2013/12: ~18x
- 2012/12: ~16,5x
- 2011/12: ~14x

- 2007 market top: ~19x
- 1999 market top: ~34x (all time record)

The WSJ P/E is computed correctly. Some websites report P/E as 17-18 instead of 22-23 because they're using Price/NTM Estimates instead of Price/LTM Earnings. Some analyst aggregation services (Factset, Reuters, etc.) have reported P/Es as low as 15-16 because they're using Price/NTM Non-GAAP Adjusted Estimates.",42

As a manufacturing startup and funded only by the founder's retirement savings, the scale up to production-readiness has financial bottlenecks.  A  machine or two, costing $50k and 25k, and unable to be leased or borrowed, is throttling the momentum.  Said machines are necessary for testing efficiency (reducing time between tests from 1month to several days) and eventually will be used in production capacity.

My argument was for the founder to create a Kickstarter campaign.  His concern is if the final tests are unstatisfactory the project is a wash, and any crowd funding would be considered a ""scam"" because he doesn't know if the final product is viable until testing completes.  He won't consider crowdfunding until he knows for sure.

I'm glanced at the TOS for Kickstarter and haven't found something relating to R&amp;D project status.  Only consequence is if you knowing go into a campaign in an effort to scam and never have the intention of making a product.

15-11-02,A Dozen Things I’ve Learned from Charlie Munger,"**1. STAY IN YOUR CIRCE OF COMPETENCE**: Know the edge of your own competency. It is not a competency if you don’t know the edge of it.

**2. MAINTAIN A MARGIN OF SAFETY**: Buy assets at a bargain so your investing results can be financially attractive even if you make a mistake. Price is not always the same as value. Avoid big mistakes. Reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets. Reputation earned over a lifetime can be lost in seconds.

**3. THINK INDEPENDENTLY AND WITH OPPORTUNITY COST IN MIND**: Markets and crowds are not always wise. Allocate your time and other resources to your most attractive opportunities. The highest and best use of a resource is always measured by the next best use.

**4. BE INTELLECTUALLY HUMBLE**: Recognize that the world is genuinely complex and that what you know is a fraction of what you still don’t know. Wait for what you expect rather try to forecast timing. Think about second order and above impacts of anything.

**5. BE SMART BY NOT BEING STUPID**: Tune out stupidity. The greatest and most important risk is permanent loss of capital, not just volatility in price. Only accept risk when you are properly compensated for assuming that risk. Activity for its own sake is not intelligent.

**6. BE PATIENT, BUT AGGRESSIVE WHEN IT IS TIME**: Great opportunities do not appear that often, but when they do appear they won’t last long so you must be aggressive when the time is right. When the odds of success are very substantially in your favor, bet big.

**7. BE PREPARED**: Great investments are hard to find but by consistently working hard you might find a few of them. You only need to find a few great investments in a lifetime.

**8. KEEP IT SIMPLE**: Apply organized common sense when solving a problem or when doing an analysis of an opportunity. Think more and calculate less. Avoid false precision and unnecessary transaction costs. Try not to interrupt interest that is compounding. Focus on being a business analyst, not a macroeconomic forecaster. Pay attention to the business cycle, but don’t try to predict it.

**9. ACCEPT CHANGE**: Avoid master plans since change is the only constant in life. Adapt. Look for evidence that would dis-confirm your own ideas. Understand arguments from all sides. Face your problems.

**10. THINK BROADLY**: Use multiple models from many disciplines in doing an analysis. Borrow the great ideas of the best thinkers in every discipline. The antidote to man with a hammer syndrome is a full set of tools.

**11. AVOID HUBRIS**: Try to avoid fooling yourself, which is hard since it is easy to do. Understand that more of success in life is luck than you imagine.

**12. KEEP LEARNING**: Be a learning machine. Never stop reading. Be curious. Surround yourself with smart people. Set aside time to read and think.",3

15-11-02,Investment portfolio for charitable organization. Let me know what you think.,"I was asked to come up with a reccommendation for an investment stratagy for a chartitable organization a friend of mine is in. 
Here is what i came up with, 
1.5 Years worth of expenses in high yield savings account,
1.1 Years in 1 Year CD
1.1 Years in 2 Year CD
1.1 Years in 3 Year CD
1.1 Years in 4 Year CD
1.1 Years in 5 Year CD
The 1.1 years as well as the 1.5 years in savings is supposed to be a safety factor if their spending changes. Is this conservative enough? 

So that is 7 Years of expenses in CDs.
Then with the rest of their money i would do 
60% in VYM, yield 3.4%
40% in VCIT, yield 3.3%
I wanted to avoid international and i figured the CDs sort of mimic treasuries so I decided to go with corporate bonds. 
With the dividends from this, every year buy a 5 year CD. Also rebalance to 60/40.

Based on this they would have a slight shortfall starting in 7 years assuming no fundraising but generating a few thousands in fund raising will hopefully allow them to be funded forever. 

Let me know what you think, too aggressive? Too conservative?

Normally, when people buy stocks online, they have to pay a commission for the actions of each company they would buy, even if you have an online stock broker that costs $7 per trade if you want to buy shares in 30 different companies, it would cost $210 in commissions to your online broker. If you wish to add to your positions each month, it will cost $210 per month or $2,520 per year! Fortunately, there is a new breed of online investment dealers that are set up to allow people to purchase common shares in many companies for a small sum of money.

I've just received the first part (30k in my bank account after taxes (got 50k, 20k withheld), getting the other 20k (my income in 2016 will be lower than in 2015, so expecting to pay less % taxes on this part) once I start), and am looking to invest this to hedge against inflation. I won't be starting work until next August and don't want to spend this money right now.

I still have about 10k left from my internship and will be using this money for living expenses and travel until then (Tuition is covered by scholarships).

My main goal is to hedge this against inflation, so I'll be looking to create an e-trade brokerage account, investing about 50% in traditional blue chip stocks w/dividends, 30% in high growth younger companies which I'd anticipate higher than average returns in the long run (google, facebook, tesla, etc.), 10% in riskier stocks that could have higher returns (need to research this), and the remaining 10% in bonds.

I was wondering what you all thought of this plan, and if you'd have any suggestions for stocks/bonds that fall into these categories. I'd like to diversify by industry and whatnot.

If it is relevant, the level of income from the job will be 100k/year, with food and transportation paid for by the employer, and I live in San Fransisco (and will continue to after college). I will also be getting 120k in equity grants over the next 4 years, and an annual target bonus of 7% (may be higher or lower depending on the company's performance, so I am assuming that I will not get this money for planning purposes).

Haven't done my taxes for 2015 yet, but will split my return between investing in a similar way, and travel/recreation, and after building around 25k in a savings account, my disposable income from the job will be spent in a similar way.",0

On Friday they reported they didn't add as many new loans as expected (but crushed earnings) and have a case brought against them so they took a huge dip. I think they will just have to pay a fine and will be a good hold once the lawsuit fades from investor's minds and they report another great quarter.

15-11-03,What is the advantage of seeking dividends as a portfolio strategy?,"I was reading about the Mogdliani-Miller Irrelevance Theorem. It proved that there is no difference between a company paying out dividends vs reinvesting those funds. But with the tax structure, it's actually advantageous for shareholders if the company reinvests.

Consider if a dividend was 10$. As per the Irrelevance theorem, it wouldn't affect the investors those 10$ were paid out or reinvested. However, with taxes, a 10$ dividend would be taxed at about 50% (USA). However, if the company just reinvested the money, then the stock would go up by 10$. The investor could then just sell 10$ worth of stocks, and would only be taxed at 25-30%. The investor is better off. 

That's my understanding. Why then, are dividend-based strategies used by people? Is it ignorance, or am I missing something? Thanks",0

15-11-02,Value Investing and Intrinsic Value,"I'm new to investing and have been researching different investing strategies. One that I commonly see recommended is forming a valuation of a company based on your own research, determining it's intrinsic value, and investing based on it (i.e. value investing). From what I understand it boils down to the market value not being the true value of the company.

If that were the case, then why would you assume the market value will eventually converge to the intrinsic value? Surely if the market is inefficient now then there is no reason for the stock to eventually conform to it's true value?",12

I'm at the point now where I've got a decent amount of money in my portfolio so I should probably be ready to react if the market turns on me.

I currently have two broker accounts and it seems one of them will allow me to open an account which allows for short trading. There isn't anything I want to short at the moment, but I'm thinking I should probably open it and be ready to sell my positions and start shorting in the event of another market crash.

I'm at the point where I understand the risks and I think I'm probably ready to short trade, but how do I know for sure? There's so many people warning traders against it that it's got me feeling a little hesitant to try it.

My plan isn't to do anything risky if the market did start to decline, my plan mainly being just to short the SPDR ETF until the worse is over or something.",0

15-11-03,Is now a good time to invest internationally?,"I have some investing knowledge, but very little personal experience. I'm young, have a steady job, and am looking to get into the market for the first time.

Some people have the opinion that it's impossible/ very difficult to time the stock market. However, charts showing the correlation between market capitalization/ GDP ratio and cyclical turns seem pretty convincing (at least to me), and indicate that the U.S. is overvalued pretty significantly. http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Market-Cap-to-GDP.php

I'm not asking for anyone to predict the future with absolute certainty, but is this an important factor to consider?

The same formula suggests that the rest of the world is ""undervalued"" by comparison: http://www.starcapital.de/research/stockmarketvaluation

And emerging markets are even more undervalued than developed international markets: https://blog.wealthfront.com/emerging-markets/

So, my original plan was to do something like 70% total U.S. mutual fund/ 30% total international mutual fund. However, if a ""correction"" is likely/ inevitable in the next few years or so, would it make sense to do something like 20% total U.S., 40% developed international, 40% emerging international? (This would be a temporary strategy for the next few years, and would be rebalanced when the U.S. CAPE ratio declines). I have a feeling people are going to say this is a terrible idea, but I'd be curious to hear different opinions. Also, assuming it is a bad idea to invest 80% internationally, what is the next best option under the assumption that U.S. stocks could decline in the next few years?",3

**Portfolio Allocation**

* Large Cap (NOT SPY) - 15%

* Large Cap Value - 2.5%

* Mid Cap - 17.5%

* Mid Cap Value - 2.5%

* Small Cap Value - 17.5%

* Canada all Equity - 15%

* Australia all Equity - 15%

* Emerging Markets - 15% (the ETF Im looking at is VWO)

**A couple quick notes:**

* Rebalancing will be, at most, every year and will only occur when proportions get majorly out of alignment with the above, reducing taxes and fees. (All assets in ETFs)

* Bonds were left out due to Jeremy Siegel's great research on ultra-long term risks and returns

* Beta means little for a time horizon this long (see W. Buffett &amp; Munger) so please don't include that in your discussion.

15-11-03,I investing my life savings into one stock.,"I know it's not wise, but you have to see it from my perspective.

I want to own a house one day in the town where I was born. The cheapest thing available is about $800k. I'm 30 years old, make about as much as I'll ever make, and will never be able to buy a house without getting extremely lucky. Because of the cost of living, I have almost no money left over after expenses. I live like a spartan. 

Since high school I've saved up about $50k. If I put $50k into an index fund, there's a good chance it will grow around the same rate as property value in my area. At best, if I do everything the right way, I'll finally be a homeowner when I'm 70.

So if I'm to get what I want, I'm forced to take a bigger risk than I'd like. I need to find a company that can quadruple my $50k in 5-10 years but also one which, at the very least, won't leave me broke. So today I put all my money in El Pollo Loco (LOCO) - I was also considering Vivint Solar. I'll spare you the reasons which I chose LOCO, but I would like to hear why this was a bad idea.",4
15-11-03,"Tesla's Earnings Report Draws More Attention to Output Than Loss","The Model S last month lost its recommendation from Consumer Reports after owners complained about quality issues as mundane as a squeaky sunroof to major issues like the electric motor needing to be replaced, the publication said in its forthcoming December issue.
“Sentiment is 2015 deliveries will come in near low end of guidance (and guidance could potentially be lowered) with low Model X volumes,” said analyst Ben Kallo of Robert W. Baird &amp; Co., who has a neutral rating on the stock, in a preview note. “We need to see a few thousand Model X vehicles produced before we gain comfort in TSLA’s production ability.”
Musk has been candid about the challenges of the vehicle’s complex and distinct features, including the “falcon-wing” doors, independently operable second-row seats and large, panoramic windshield, not to mention reliance on suppliers. Tesla has delivered 33,157 cars through the first three quarters, according to a preliminary tally, which would mean it must deliver 16,843 vehicles in the final three months of the year to reach the low end of its guidance of 50,000 to 55,000 vehicles.
Skepticism has been rising despite the fact that Tesla released the first of its autopilot features -- to the cheers of owners, such as talk-show host Stephen Colbert -- a key step on the path to full autonomous driving.

First post here. I have been long awaiting for Disney to dip but that has not happened. I have decided to take a long position on Wells Fargo Bank.

SWANX= 75.02 shares at 23.5 thatI bought for 20.3 for.

15-11-03,Buying a house to rent is worth it?,"Throw-away for obvious reasons. Some back ground info, I'm low 30's, live in a developing country, own my own house (no mortgage) and am a PhD student. I have no income other than from investments. Have a family, wife and two young kids.

My house is worth around 300k USD. Cash savings of 100k USD, Physical gold and silver around 200k USD. We have other odds and ends (cars, high end watches) that if we sold used would be worth about 200k USD. I also have 600k USD in Bitcoin that I would like to diversify. I do not trust the banks for 1% interest and think the stock market is overly high. I'm waiting for a massive correction and I really don't care if I ever enter that market. I have no debt and no credit as I have never borrowed money.

I'm thinking about buying in cash a 150K USD house and renting it out. This would be in the same gated community where I currently live so I would have easy access and the assistance of the guards if needed.

I'm not sure exactly on the rent I would be able to get for the house but I do know a $105k USD house down the road is being rented for $400 a month. I'm assuming I will get around $600 a month.

The point of buying the house is that it will give us some monthly income forever. The rent price should go up or down based on the cost of living. We would use this money for about one third of our monthly spending so I'm not worried about nominal gains/losses based on inflation/deflation.

There are no taxes on the ownership of land here.

I do not have a job and will not for at least 3 years (if ever) but we have more than enough savings. Our cost of living is pretty low in this country and we could lower it by half if needed (not eating out daily, no live in maid).

Anything wrong with this strategy? Anything I'm forgetting about or are there better ways to use the money? Should I buy two houses? I really think Bitcoin is great but I want to limit my risks and make sure my family is taken care of for life no matter what happens with it.

Thank you for your time.

15-11-03,Daily advice thread. All questions about your personal situation should be asked here,"If your question is ""I have $10,000, what do I do?"" or anything similar. There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

Be aware that these answers are just opinions of Redditors and should be used as a starting point for your research. You should strongly consider seeing a registered financial rep before making any financial decisions!

15-11-03,The case for $ELTP,"Elite Pharmaceuticals has been on the radar for sometime now. I just wanted to list a few reasons why I'm still long the stock and encourage you to buy it too so I can get richer. Would love to hear any criticism as well.

Elite Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company developing a pipeline of abuse-deterrent opioid products as well as some niche generic products. They have a number of products on the market already, but the big story (and potential gainz) is their lead opioid abuse candidate, ELI-200. The stock has made some substantial gains in the past two weeks since announcing positive results from the Phase 3 trial of ELI-200 and the intentions to submit an NDA by the end of the year. 

Revenues jumped substantially to $7 million last quarter (had never surpassed $2 million previously) based on sales of generic products unrelated to ELI-200. While I don't think further strong showings in the revenue area will have a large impact on the stock, management is optimistic that growth in sales of their core generic products will allow the company to support further R&amp;D efforts.",8

* Equity and bond markets pretty much rigged... it is seen as political taboo for them ever to drop.

* The whole world reliant on the state to always come to the rescue.

* Eurozone ""experiment"" seeming to be cracking.

* Rise of socialism.. Sanders in U.S Jeremy Corbyn in Uk

* Printed a sh*t ton of money and still virtually zero inflation.


Thats just for starters, you can't talk to anyone in the markets that doesnt just shake their head and say ""what a mess"". BUT, humans love a scare story, we are always looking for a disaster. People have been calling for another 08 style crash since.. well 08. I think central bankers are morons for the most part.

This is a Calgary Oil and Gas company that operates in central Alberta; nothing special, but, they're actually doing extremely well right now.

I hold the stock for voting rights and sentimental reasons and would never sell unless I needed to or was able to turn a killer profit. 

Anyways... Here is my next sub-penny stock pick for everyone that wanted it; so crazy!

15-11-03,Some simple questions I have.,"When I was in college, with no real plans for my financial future, I had a friend of mine take a go at the financial world.  He asked to sit with me and talk about my retirements.  Long story short: He set up a Roth IRA for retirement, with investments in Capital Word Growth (CWGIX), and then a 5-10year savings plan with investments in ABF class A and Intermediate Bond Fund.  I invested a little bit monthly, but then didn't have the funds so I stopped contributing.  My friend eventually left the game, and my account was handed over to another rep from the same company (Sagepoint aka Independent Capital Management). 

I now make a lot more money and have been maxing out my Roth, and have primarily been putting savings into an Ally account at 1% apy.  

I've spoken to my current financial manager once of the past five years.

My question: Would it be prudent to make any changes to my situation, e.g. changing my advisor, or the company I use?  I recently read ""the millionaire next door"" and their suggestion was to procure a reputable CPA and financial adviser from trustworthy sources, and of individuals with experienced backgrounds. Does my new adviser make commission off of my contributions to my Roth?  Any general advise or suggested readings?

...There are many such failures since central banks decided to provide stimulus to the markets.  The most recent one is a quick reversal immediately after a death cross in S&amp;P 500. This reversal has caused significant underperformance of long-only strategies that implement a 50-200 moving average crossover filter as a timing signal.

..The “lazy investor” revenge in recent years is only due to support received directly from central banks. This will change at some point and passive investors should be prepared to face the realities of mean-reverting markets.

15-11-03,[The Irrelevant Investor] When Is the Right Time to Sell Big Winners? h/t The Reformed Broker,"&gt;There is still one other argument investors sometimes use to separate themselves from the profits they would otherwise make. This one is the most ridiculous of all. It is that the stock they own has had a huge advance. Therefore, just because it has gone up, it has probably used up most of its potential. Consequently they should sell it and buy something that hasn’t gone up yet. Outstanding companies, the only type which I believe the investor should  buy, just don’t function this way. How they do function might be best understood by considering the following somewhat fanciful analogy.

Read the article for the great analogy:

Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.

Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC
Thanks, everybody. Elon, just thinking longer term here, assuming Tesla establishes itself as a leader in autonomous transport, do you see a business case for selling autonomous cars to ride-sharing firms, or can Tesla cut out the middleman and offer on-demand electric mobility services directly from the company's own platform?

Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer
I think we'd have to say, no comment.

Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC
I mean, Elon, it's kind of unusual for you to punt on strategic questions of a long-term nature. Is this a dumb question? Or a funny question?

Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer
Actually, I think it's quite a smart question, actually.

Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC

Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC

Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer
You know...

Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC
Is it because of a competitive sensitivity, or is it because the concept itself is just too... in flux?

Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer
I think there's a right time to make announcements. And this is not that time.

Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC
Fair play. All right, can I ask one on Autopilot?

Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer
And nor – I mean, nor is our strategy fully baked here. So for us to state what it would be – it's not fully baked, so there's no – we'd prefer to announce something when we think we've got the full story understood.

Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC

15-11-03,Can I invest into a Mutual Fund Bi-Monthly for no fee?,"I am a customer of Capital One Investing because I have dipped my toes in some tech stocks and ETF's in the past and chose ShareBuilder, which is now part of Capital One. Now my goal is to get a automatic investing plan going that puts $250 each pay period (2X a month) into a mutual fund that would perform on par with the S&amp;P 500. 

Can I invest in a fund for no fee on a recurring basis that mirrors (or leverages) the S&amp;P 500? If so, how?

With fee's in the 6 dollar range, I feel like I am starting at a loss with only investing so little. I see ""no-load"" mutual funds on ShareBuilder and if I read it right it seems that there is no commision fees, but if I go to purchase it, it lists a $25 Share Builder plan. http://i.imgur.com/16i8tau.png Is that monthly, are there any other fee's i'm not aware of?

15-11-03,Give me your favorite strategy for making money on the market,"With so much information out there swirling in cyberspace it can be easy to overlook seemingly obvious yet genuinely great investment ideas.  Removed from the muck of promises for quick riches from penny stocks and other get-rich-quick schemes, there are sound investment ideas out there that really can enhance your net worth (and many of them are easy).  It can be a stock, currency, anything under the sun, but I'd love to hear from you all about what you found works best for you time and time again.  Here's my favorite that I've come to use thanks to years of cruising sites like reddit and accidental discoveries I've made from various other sources.

1.  The VIX Method

Investors may scoff at this concept, I mean I am merely playing ranges, but this has been fool proof for me and I'm happy to share it all with you here.  I credit Peter F. Way (CFA) for this strategy.  I found his articles while surfing Seeking Alpha one fine day.  Here's the overview. http://seekingalpha.com/article/2996516-when-will-the-vix-tell-us-its-time-to-buy-svxy
The concept is so simple it's stupid.  SVXY is a Short-Term Futures ETF that moves inversely to the VIX which on very basic terms measures volatility.  So when things are great over a longer period of time- think nice peaceful upward hill for many months over the major indices- SVXY will go up (and in the end it always has-volatility never stays high for very long).  Over the past four years or so the SVXY has moved within a very specific range.  It's low is around $40 and it's high is just shy of $100.  My strategy is this:  whenever SVXY sinks below $55 or so I buy, and by buy I mean I throw everything I have at it (so much for diversification).  Then I wait, it may take many months but eventually SVXY will rise. I like to set a very conservative target of $75 before I consider selling.  Then I sell, then I wait, and do it all over again.  I've done this four times now and every time it has guaranteed returns.  You may ask why not buy on the reverse with it's counterpart VXX.  You'll notice that it's chart shows crazy decay, and that in short is why I stay away from it.  

Looking forward to hearing your ideas.",0

15-11-04,MEIP,"I have been looking through this the past few weeks, and think the results at ASH are going to be fairly predictable. Here are my thoughts:

To begin, see the excellent write-up by JBEM: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/jbem777/DD/g5S_xwJpOa4

The ASH conference is going to deal with 2 topics, MDS and AML studies. I am not an oncologist, but I know how to use google. MDS is early stage AML, and both are pretty much a death sentence given the current drugs. 

The best current treatment for both of these is Vidaza, which is really not that effective. MEIP has created Pracinostat, and is presenting data on whether the Vidaza Pracinostat cocktail is better than Vidaza alone. This brings us to the presentations:

1. Pracinostat on MDS. Top line data was presented in March, and was admittedly shit. Once the study was unblinded, MEIP was able to analyze subsets of where it was extremely effective. This is the data that will be presented. From what I have read http://www.meipharma.com/our-programs/pracinostat the product is almost identical to Vidaza in the early stages (a little harder [like a good cocktail]). However, if the patient can hang on for more than 4 cycles, the cocktail has clinical benefit. 

2. Pracinostat on AML. This is a gimme. In their corporate presentation http://investor.meipharma.com/ we notice that the 1 year survival rate is 60%. To obtain a statistically significant result from Vidaza alone, we need median survival time of 12.7 months. Let's go back to grade 3 data management, the median is the middle, and we have 60% of 50 still in the study. That means we need 26 people of 30 to live 0.7 months for yacht, as of August. Let's take this further...

After 60 days, 10% of people died off. During the first year, 42% had complete remission. That means we still had 50 * 42% = 21 people who are almost certainly going to live the month. We have 30 - 21 = 9 individuals at risk for the month (ish), and we need 5 of them to survive. If we treat each as a coin flip, that is about a 75% chance of a yacht (binomial distribution summed from 0 to 5 [it is greater because we need 0.7 and not a whole month]). However, this can be improved because the probability of survival is better than 50-50 for each of the 9, so we should adjust it. 

We know that these 9 individuals survived:

1. 60 days (2 months)

2. 1 Year

5 people died in the first 60 days, 30 survived 1 year, so 50 - 30 - 5 = 15 died over 10 months. Let's assume the surviving 9 have the same distribution of death for simplicity, and that is is poisson distributed again for simplicity. We get a lambda of 1.5 (15 / 10) per month, or probability of 1 - sum_{i = 6}^{9} exp(-1.5) * 1.5 ^ i / i! = 99%. But we recognize that surviving a period of time increases chances of survival, so this represents a lower bound.

Translation: Pracinostat is almost certainly going to phase 3 for the treatment of AML. The upside is the AML market (roughly $450MM atm http://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/acute-myeloid-leukemia-therapeutics-market.html) with Orphan Drug status, and whatever comes from MDS data is gravy. The downside is the cash position of the company (the current share price) or a little bit less because of impatient investors.

The storied hedge-fund manager said the Federal Reserve should have ended its post-crisis “emergency measures” by now, as he warned about excessive risk taking.
“The reason I think it’s going to end badly is at some point — over six years when you have zero rates and quantitative easing — you move investors out the risk curve,” he said late Tuesday at the annual DealBook conference in New York. “You cause emerging-market governments ... to act in ways they’ve never been able to act in history, because the markets wouldn’t have let them, [and] you cause corporations to start acting in bizarre ways, buying back twice as much stock ... at, you know, record prices.”

The star of the company is Ataluren (Translarna™) for Genetic Disorders which [got licensed in the EU](http://www.ptcbio.com/files/2214/3033/8004/PipelineTest4-1-3.jpg). This drug interacts with the ribosome, which is the component of the cell that decodes the mRNA molecule and manufactures proteins, to enable the ribosome to read through premature nonsense stop signals on mRNA and allow the cell to produce a full-length, functional protein. As a result, ataluren has the potential to be an important therapy for genetic disorders for which a nonsense mutation is the cause of the disease. 

Diseases that can be cured by this drug include: Duchenne muscular dystrophy for ambulatory patients who are 5 years or older, a disease affecting around 1 in 3,600 boys, which results in muscle degeneration and premature death.

NOTE(!!!): An application for approval of ataluren for nonsense mutation cystic fibrosis (nmCF) has not been submitted and therefore, ataluren for nmCF is only available through clinical trials at this point.

Personal analysis
--

Pros:

- Now, I am a technical analyst. I love that stuff. It's my ~~meat~~ pussy. From that point of view, ~~all~~ alot of the studies indicate a strong BUY signal. Volume, bull power, ~~momentum, everything, perfect point to buy in~~ might indicate buying in.
- The folks in the Board of Directors look like incredibly bright people who know what they are doing.
- The institutional holding is straight up nuts and the fact that none of them have sold their batch tells me that whatever is cooking at PTCT, big money believes in it.

Cons:

- Horrible, horrible financials. The trend over the past 4 years has been bad, but that is most likely due to the cost of research.
- Increase in short interest is continuing but at a slower rate
- No drug catalyst in sight that I could find.

Conclusion:

I expect the latest earnings report to be just as poor as the past ones, but nonetheless it is already past its projected PT of $26 which might mean it could drop again tomorrow, or it will continue its ascend. The technical analysis is strongly in favor or a continued rise tomorrow though, and the high institutional ownership suggests that there is strong confidence this will go up from here on up. Then again the high institutional ownership doesn't give a lot of wiggle room for it to shoot up like AVXL. Shrekhli said he does not believe in yoloing and that you can only make real money if you do weeks of DD and then invest and hold for a long time. He said in his livestream that there is no way one could make 8% in a month to which I have to laugh. So this recommendation might be something for /r/investing rather than /r/wsb. But, what do I know. Please provide input if you read something else in these numbers.

Q/A:

Q: Can I yolo this on Robinhood?

A: Yes.

Q: Where did you get the studies from?

A: Snipping tooled ThinkorSwim by TD Ameritrade

Q: What does each study mean?

A: You can read what each study means here from A-Z: http://tlc.thinkorswim.com/center/charting/studies/studies-library.html

Q: OP, I wanna have your babies.

A: Send me pics and I'll think about it.

Q: Do you hold any $PTCT stocks or options, do you plan on buying?

A: Don't hold anything yet, but I think I would yolo it if there weren't more attractive stocks ($ADAT, $AVXL, $XOMA).

Q: Are you a pumper?

A: No, sir/m'am. I'm too humble for that.",8
15-11-04,Quick question on call options,"I've been trading stocks for about 4 months and am ready to dip my feet into options. While researching what they are exactly I'm getting mixed results. Some say it's the right to buy a stock at a certain price while paying a premium for them. Some other sources say it's paying a premium for the stock profits. (assuming it goes up)

So which is it? Paying a premium for the right to buy a stock (then selling it) or the right to buy a stocks profits during speculation of earnings, news, etc.",1
15-11-04,Feeling overwhelmed learning how to trade stocks.,"Last Friday (10/30) I read an article about hemp being legal to grow in NC as of 10/31, the article mentioned $HEMP was in the process of building a plant in NC.  I thought this is probably a great time to learn how to trade stocks as I assumed $HEMP would quickly rise based on the legalization of growing it.  I went to tdameritrade and quickly signed up for an account and bought 8400 shares of $HEMP at 0.058.  Over the weekend I watched a ton of youtube videos trying to understand what I was in for and I feel like every time I learned something, I had 50 more questions. Anyways, Monday rolls around and I sell everything at 9:42am for 0.119, beginners luck.

All the articles I've read and videos I've watched seem to assume you have a bit of prior knowledge at using a trade system and all the different terms accompanied with it.  Maybe I'm not looking in the right places, but tying all the pieces together is overwhelming and I'm not quite sure where to begin.
 
 * I learned $HEMP is a pennystock and a lot of investors think it's trash.  Why?  

 * What is Order type? Limit, %stop, etc

 * Time-in-force? The table provided by tdameritrade explaining time-in-force doesn't make sense to me.

 * How do you research which stocks to buy?

 * What are options?

 * Am I asking the right questions to understand the complexity of stock trading?

 * What are futures?

15-11-04,Opinions,"Hey all. So I did less of a technical analysis and more of a soft analysis of 3 companies that I am thinking of adding to my portfolio. 

I figured SolarCity (SCTY) to be a decent investment. Financially, they're not too well off, but I figured that while they have a lot of quantifiable information, their biggest value drivers are (1) the nature of their industry (who doesn't get a boner from solar power these days, right?) and (2) Elon Musk buying more shares during the August drop (who doesn't get a boner from Elon Musk these days, right?). Remind anyone of Tesla?

Raytheon (RTN) and Honeywell (HON), both are defense contractors. Given how conflict is switching from soldier-run to machine-run, I'd say they're both solid investments. Financially, they've been steady, neither are at a loss but neither are displaying any numbers that are beyond ordinary. Drawback is that I own stock in Lockheed Martin - I just don't think it would help my diversification. The 3% dividend yield and the relative stability of both companies is nice, though.

15-11-04,Why happiness on Tesla?,"The Q3 earnings report doesn't change the picture much for bears. The company is still evolving badly, and is likely to miss its 2015 deliveries guidance. 

2016 deliveries guidance (implied in the 1,600-1,800 vehicles per week guided for by Tesla for 2016) is also likely to come down.

So why the after-hours happiness?

I have three possible reasons for this:

* It was probably a crowded trade going into the report. Tesla underperformed wildly going into the report, which was amazing for such a high-beta, story-driven stock in a very hot stock market. Ordinarily, the stock would have at least followed the Nasdaq 100 as it ploughed new highs.
* Tesla spoke of bringing Gigafactory cell production on-line during late 2016, which is ahead of schedule. 
* The company lowered the high end of its deliveries guidance for 2015 (from 55,000 to 52,000), but it still kept the low end (50,000) steady. This gives analysts something to hold on to, and thus, might lead to much less in terms of downward revisions for Q4 2015 and 2016.

15-11-04,Hypothetical strategy,"Totally inexperienced person here. So what're the drawbacks to this strategy, if the goal is to make marginal gains.

Lets say I'm using a broker with a 0% commission fee, and I want to invest $1000. Why not invest it in a $2-3 stock that seems to be on an upswing, wait for it to increase in value by a penny or two, and then sell it immediately after and make like $5-10?

I see the inherent risk, but would that transaction yield the $5-10 profit, or are there other losses/taxes to be concerned about?",1
15-11-04,Telesta Therapeutics (Symbol: BNHLF) - FDA Adcom on Nov 18th - huge potential,"Google the following article:
Telesta Therapeutics: Near-Term Catalyst Could Provide Multi-Bagger Returns

Valuation summary (all share prices in US dollars)

• Fair valuation today: $300 million. Shareprice: $1.04.

• Fair valuation following positive advisory committee recommendation: $600 million. Shareprice: $2.08.

• Fair valuation following 2nd Phase 3 trial recommendation: $150 million. Shareprice: $.52.

• For valuation following 2nd phase 3 trial recommendation with concurrent FDA approved drug sales: valuation $400 million. Shareprice: $1.38.

• Fair valuation following FDA approval: $1 billion. Shareprice: $3.47.

• Fair valuation long-term following FDA approval: $3 billion to $4.5 billion. Shareprice: $10.41 to $15.62.

Telesta is currently trading in the $.55 range in the US, so any of the above scenarios would provide significant returns. The only caveat, is that if a 2nd phase 3 trial is recommended, the company could trade well under fair valuation for a period of time.

Telesta provides 3 opportunities that could generate short-term multi-bagger returns:

• Telesta is so undervalued that with any level of Wall Street awareness, the share price could be driven higher. As we get closer to November 18, the shareprice could rise in anticipation of a positive recommendation.

• When the company reports the results of the FDA's advisory committee, if the results are positive, the share price should rise again.

• In February we will learn whether or not the FDA has approved Telesta's lead drug. With FDA approval, Telesta should be worth at least $1 billion and I would expect buyout offers in that range.

FDA precedent has already been established with Valstar's approval, and I believe MCNA with its superior clinical results will be approved in February. In effect, this is an opportunity to buy a soon to be $1 billion company, for $150 million, a true Buffett trade.

15-11-04,ATTENTION PLEBS! THIS IS A GENUINE STOCK TIP! (The value of DD),"TL;DR: I expect BGMD to post a multi-million dollar ""product fee"" on the upcoming ER -- read on to see if I'm full of shit.

Posted without too much comment so you can make your own decision on whether or not to play BGMD's ER.   I expect it to go up on ER, Yahoo Message boards expect it to go down because Abbott pays 60 days after the end of BGMD's quarter and so Q3 sales will NOT show up until Q4.  Now here is the reason I expect BGMD to go up.

On their [August 17th 10qa](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001407038/000119312515292371/0001193125-15-292371-index.htm) on [Exhibit 10.6](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1407038/000119312515292371/d941096dex106.htm) if you scroll down to section 3.1 you see this.

&gt;3.1 Product Fee.
 
&gt;(a) [xxxx], as consideration for the rights and licenses granted by BGM to Abbott and its Affiliates and BGM’s agreement to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Abbott shall pay to BGM a fee as set forth in this Section 3.1, and as shown below in Table 3.1 (the “Product Fee”) for Tests sold to Third Parties in the Territory. 

&gt;(b) The Product Fee [xxxx], the following tiers shall apply:

&gt;(i) Cumulative Test sales by Abbott or its Affiliates to unaffiliated Third Parties from [xxxx];

&gt;(ii) Cumulative Test sales by Abbott or its Affiliates to unaffiliated Third Parties from [xxxx]; and

&gt;(iii) Cumulative Test sales by Abbott or its Affiliates to unaffiliated Third Parties from [xxxx]. [xxxx], Abbott shall pay the Product Fee stipulated in this Section 3.1(b) subject to the provisions of Section 3.13 on completion of the renegotiation.

-

[xxxx] is redacted as confidential information and is sealed until 2020. However the important sentence is this: **Abbott shall pay the Product Fee stipulated in this Section 3.1(b) subject to the provisions of Section 3.13 on completion of the renegotiation.** The renegotiation was concluded in May and ABT pays 60 days of the end of the quarter so that ""product fee"" whatever it is showed up July 1 - August 29 which means it will show up on revenue in Q3 ER.

Section 3.13 is ""true up"" it says next year if ABT overpaid the advance BGMD gives the a discount or refund and if Abt underpaid they give BGMD the difference.

So this is something like an advance an author might get from a publisher. IMHO.

Since this is a fee ABT is paying for the rights to patents, licenses, IP and ""other considerations"" my GUESS (and that's all it is), is around $10m. If we do get that number BGMD's cash on hand valuation approaches $1 and anticipation of Q4 earnings should drive it a bit higher (quite apart from FDA speculation).

I've hinted at this for weeks and have front loaded the crap out of it in the 50s.  But this week my hint went too far on a too popular post and got as much attention as a top line post here on WSB.  So I think you should know the reason you're putting money into this pile of shit.   And here it is.  Make your own decision, if you decide not to risk the play there will be other people buying in who do want to take on the risk and you should get out ok.

If you're taking the risk know that this product fee could be $1 or there's something in that redacted crap that keeps it from showing up until q4.  If that's the case, BGMD's cash value will be .30 and not $1 and you will probably be holding waiting for FDA (which isn't too far off if it really comes this year -- but FDA can come as late as the end of March, or the FDA could ask for more info, or it could just say no).

Know the risks.   My accumulation was a pure earnings play and this HAS run up because I couldn't keep my trap shut.   

BGMD's earnings should be around 11/14 (saturday) which means later next week or early the following.

P.S.:  Mods please do the board a solid and sticky this for a day or so, so people who bought in on a ""hint"" can decide if this is worth risking their money!",32

15-11-04,$DIS - Straddle Play?,"Looking at today's price action makes me think there is a buying opportunity for this stock. 

I bought calls right before their Feb 2015 earnings and hit a 300% gain. Thankfully, I sat out of this summer's bloodletting. The stock got absolutely crushed in August after earnings.

What's the best way to play this? Disney's options have comparatively cheap premiums (I'm guessing because of low IV) but earnings will still probably give the stock a pop of $5 up or down.

I was thinking about Nov 20th 120 calls and Nov 20th 110 puts.

The last time I made a play on Disney it was easy: Christmas sales were going to beat and I knew that the sales of Frozen merch was still going to be strong even a year after the movie.

My next definite move is to own calls (possibly out to July) and hold on to them through Star Wars and the Christmas season through February.

This earnings round, there is no Star Wars yet, so do you guys expect continued sell pressure before and after earnings, or is today's move a tactic to shake out the bulls for earnings?

Never straddled anything. Wondering if this is a good time to use one of those strategies I read in an options book years ago. Thoughts?",2

One recent idea I had was to consider using the VIX to weight a technical indicator, similar to the way that some use a volume weighted moving average.

My thinking was this: The VIX measures uncertainty (unofficially, I do understand what it ACTUALLY represents). Therefore, as VIX rises, trends are more likely to decompose and while the VIX remains at a relatively lower level trends are likely to continue. By weighting an indicator using the daily VIX reading, the indicator would react quicker when the market moves against the trend.

15-11-04,BGMD could have a q3 ER Surprise,"Cross-posted from /r/wallstreetbets (Edited for a more genteel audience)

TL;DR: I expect BGMD to post a multi-million dollar ""product fee"" on the upcoming ER.

Posted without too much comment so you can make your own decision on whether or not to play BGMD's ER.   I expect it to go up on ER, Yahoo Message boards expect it to go down because Abbott pays 60 days after the end of BGMD's quarter and so Q3 sales will NOT show up until Q4.  Now here is the reason I expect BGMD to go up.

On their [August 17th 10qa](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001407038/000119312515292371/0001193125-15-292371-index.htm) on [Exhibit 10.6](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1407038/000119312515292371/d941096dex106.htm) if you scroll down to section 3.1 you see this.

&gt;3.1 Product Fee.
 
&gt;(a) [xxxx], as consideration for the rights and licenses granted by BGM to Abbott and its Affiliates and BGM’s agreement to the other terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Abbott shall pay to BGM a fee as set forth in this Section 3.1, and as shown below in Table 3.1 (the “Product Fee”) for Tests sold to Third Parties in the Territory. 

&gt;(b) The Product Fee [xxxx], the following tiers shall apply:

&gt;(i) Cumulative Test sales by Abbott or its Affiliates to unaffiliated Third Parties from [xxxx];

&gt;(ii) Cumulative Test sales by Abbott or its Affiliates to unaffiliated Third Parties from [xxxx]; and

&gt;(iii) Cumulative Test sales by Abbott or its Affiliates to unaffiliated Third Parties from [xxxx]. [xxxx], Abbott shall pay the Product Fee stipulated in this Section 3.1(b) subject to the provisions of Section 3.13 on completion of the renegotiation.

-

[xxxx] is redacted as confidential information and is sealed until 2020. However the important sentence is this: **Abbott shall pay the Product Fee stipulated in this Section 3.1(b) subject to the provisions of Section 3.13 on completion of the renegotiation.** The renegotiation was concluded in May and ABT pays 60 days of the end of the quarter so that ""product fee"" whatever it is showed up July 1 - August 29 which means it will show up on revenue in Q3 ER.

Section 3.13 is ""true up"" it says next year if ABT overpaid the advance BGMD gives the a discount or refund and if Abt underpaid they give BGMD the difference.

So this is something like an advance an author might get from a publisher. IMHO.

Since this is a fee ABT is paying for the rights to patents, licenses, IP and ""other considerations"" my GUESS (and that's all it is), is around $10m. If we do get that number BGMD's cash on hand valuation approaches $1 and anticipation of Q4 earnings should drive it a bit higher (quite apart from FDA speculation).

If you're taking the risk know that this product fee could be $1 or there's something in that redacted crap that keeps it from showing up until q4.  If that's the case, BGMD's cash value will be .30 and not $1 and you will probably be holding waiting for FDA (which isn't too far off if it really comes this year -- but FDA can come as late as the end of March, or the FDA could ask for more info, or it could just say no).

BGMD's earnings should be around 11/14 (saturday) which means later next week or early the following.

15-11-04,Opinions on $GPRO?,Looking for my first YOLO,1
15-11-04,PMC Sierra,"Random question, and I apologise for waffling. Back in 2013 I wrote a blog post about the dot.com boom. Google Books has a fascinating archive of old computer magazines from the 1990s, and I spent an afternoon reading through Infoweek and PC Magazine and Kiplinger's Personal Finance etc. You'd be surprised how many of Infoweek's cover stars turned out to be fraudsters.

The March 1999 issue of Kipling's recommends **PMC Sierra**. ""*Buy stocks and mutual funds on the periphery of the (Internet) phenomenon*"", it says. ""*Those with at least a couple of degrees of separation from the Amazons and eBays. Kevin Landis, portfolio manager for Firsthand funds, explains the hierarchy this way: at the bottom is a company such as PMC Sierra, which makes semi-conductors for the communications market. Its biggest customer is Cisco Systems, etc etc routers etc, which sells to MCI WorldCom, the giant telecommunications company etc etc*"".

The paragraph is quintessentially dot.commy - it has Cisco and Worldcom. Kevin Landis obviously wasn't a complete doofus because he continued to run Firsthand albeit that in 2013 there was an attempt to oust him and he seems to have done very badly of late:
[http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/05/21/star-tech-investor-kevin-landis-in-fight-for-his-job/](http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/05/21/star-tech-investor-kevin-landis-in-fight-for-his-job/)

PMC Sierra's share price graph looked like [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ii0nTt6Mtog/UmA8sQJaN7I/AAAAAAAAJws/KCsRz-zi91c/s1600/pmc.jpg) in late 2013. It split a couple of times and peaked at $245 a share post-split, if I'm reading the chart correctly. From 2001 to the present day it has slowly slid from $20 a share to $6 a share, although it recently recovered a little bit. e.g. over the last decade it has wavered within a dollar or two of $7.

People seem to have bought and sold shares in the company, but I struggle to find any significant news about them over the last fifteen years, or indeed ever - even back in 2000 people seemed to be buying the shares because it had a tangential connection with Cisco.

My question is this - why did people buy shares in PMC Sierra in, say, 2006? From an investment point of view, what did the company have to offer over the last fifteen years? It seems to have made a modest, steady profit selling microcontrollers and similar things, but from an investor's point of view, what was it *for*?",2

For instance say you buy a penny stock at a price of $10

Then you immediately place a sell order for $15

Does this place you at the front of the line (or near the front of the line for when/ if that stock reaches that price?) 

Also I've placed LARGE buy/sell orders and both bid and ask prices but the size of the bid/ask has not changed. Why is that? 

Lastly I want to clarify something please correct me if I am wrong. The bid size is how many want to buy at said price and the ask size is how many want to sell at that price?",0

15-11-05,What is par value ? What happens if a company trade below par value ?,"Below is a statement from a company.

The firm said its shares had been transacted below the current 10 sen par value. As such, the group was unable to raise funds via new shares at market prices below the par value.

Asia Bioenergy said the lower par value of five sen would provide the company with greater flexibility to raise funds and implement corporate proposals.

It reduces their par value from 10 cents to 5 cents. And I have done some Google on it. Investopedia gives an example below which I don't quite understand.

For example, if a stock was trading at $5 per share and the par value on the stock was $10, theoretically, the company would have a $5-per-share liability.

Anyone mind to explain, how it became $5 per share liability ? Thanks!

15-11-04,PVCT short DD nothing special,"This stock came up yesterday on the board and I thought I'd take a quick look into. This isn't in depth DD but its enough to get most people started.

The company: Provectus Biopharm Inc.

What they make: In short cancer treatment (for skin, breast, etc...)

Why is this possibly a good yolo? This company has 23 million in cash and no debt, which is awesome, but they also have a lot of trials that are at the end of phase 1 and in the middle of phase 2, with one heading to phase 3 soon as well as one trial currently in phase 3. If their current phase 3 goes well this stock could jump on approval but it is still a little ways away. As we all know trials for pharm companies cost a lot of money and the 23 million they have on hand it could be gone before you know it and the company could wind up in a tricky position. Last month the shareholders decided to dilute the stock and add a couple hundred thousand more shares. This is possibly because for the rest of the year this company is hitting up tons of medical conferences to show off what data they have and gathered more investors. If approvals happen for their treatments this company could hit it big but that is still far in the future. They release their earnings shortly so we will know more then. For now I'm holding off but if you are looking for a long term investment (not that many people here are), this could be a good one. Otherwise for a short term yolo you might want to stay out of it. Hope this helps a bit. I'll update this as more comes out. One other thing to note is their mkt cap is 100 mil while their ev is 79 mil.",3

Do your own DD and be extraordinarily critical of this one. Please.

Now that thats out of the way,

These guys are the future of stuff that moves.  Anything you use that senses motion with any sort of accuracy, is made by these guys.  Hoverboards, Stability control, Cellphones, Virtual Reality - all markets that Invensense is pioneering.

Ill go into the technicals in a sec, but the real winner here is their proprietary control theory algorithms, which cant be reverse engineering by Mr. Xiwang in some shady chinese factory.

Technical Stuff:

From the inside, they've been buying up shares like no tomorrow, so they know theyre cooking something good.  Their earnings have been a huge surprise every quarter, and I expect next earnings to pump this stock quarter after quarter.

Now for the grit:

Looking at the 10k, one of their big issues is diversity of suppliers and buyers.  With 90% of their material supplies coming from 3 companies, if one goes down the stock does the ol free fall.

Another risk is the fact that they are not selling to end users, since you have no use for a precision 6 axis gyro.  You could actually make a nice necklace out of it and give it to your mom.  If their buyers fuck up and make something that drives people off cliffs (segway), your trains going straight to fullujah.

THE PLAY:

Buy before christmas, where little jimmy gets his new Oculus rift, and sees 3D porn for the first time.  Earnings reported on 1/27/2016, just after the holidays.  Sell for sick gains.

Serepta Therapeutic (SRPT), Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Retrophin, Inc. (RTRX) are three of the many biotech stocks to have had substantial tumbles since the bloom went off this leading sector with the advent of fall.

Each stock is in a down trend with with SRPT up 23.6 percent on its latest longer-term short signal, INSY up 22.7 percent short, and RTRX up 38.6 percent short, all of this in the midst of a screaming market rally.

It the market wavers (and it looks as if it is beginning to), it is likely these three stocks are about to take another step down and give traders a chance to scalp profits or to have another opportunity to get on the overall down trend..

All three of these health-care equities managed to move no more than sideways during the latest market rally becoming short-term overbought.  Each have now have given individual sell signals.

These are shorts on tomorrow’s open with initial stops at yesterdays highs.

If the market, which is wildly overextended, comes down on top of them, I’m looking for all three to challenge if not break their recent lows.  For SRPT that’s around 24, for INSY approximately 22, and for RTRX 17.20.

15-11-05,GT Advanced Technologies (GTATQ) - New settlement with Apple,"I have been following this company for a year through its Bankruptcy. This weeks news has been the biggest news since Apple/GT's first settlement back in December. 1st settlement saw a run from 20 cents to 60 cents in one day or so. (Dropped back down to 45 to close If I remember correctly)

Anyways, currently 26 cents, up from 17 cents two days ago, it ran to 33 cents after GT and Apple announced a new settlement which, among other things, - 

A) Relieves GT of its debt to Apple (439 million claim, GTs biggest claim)

B) Allows GT to auction off all but 600 of its Mesa Arizona Furnaces (The furnaces that were supposed to supply sapphire for Apple)

C) Split the net proceeds of the Auction 50/50 between GT and Apple.

D) Any not sold (Besides the 600 GT will RETAIN) will be abandoned and left for apple to SCRAP them

E) Scrapped furnace value will go 50/50 between GT and Apple.

Here is more info on the settlement and the underlying motion GT is seeking BK approval of (Hearing is set for Nov. 19th)

https://www.kccllc.net/gtat/document/1411916151102000000000002

So why do I think this play will do WSB good this month? Well,

A) The settlement got huge attention today, with A LOT of it coming after the close (CNBC covered it at close) Some outlets covered it yesterday as well.

B) This auction will give GTAT an immediate cash injection to pay off portions of its other Debt in a plan of Reorganization with CASH (Bond debt). GT is rocking about 550-600 mil of other Debt, down from 1.1 bil now though.

C) The reduction of this Debt will bring GTs value up in a plan of reorganization, tied with more cash from the auction, will POSSIBLY allow shareholders to retain SOME of the company.

So here is the bet! 

A) Will the court will grant the motion the 19th?

I believe so! This settlement favors GT HEAVILY. Its a GIFT from Apple honestly. There does not seem to be abuse here, GT has been trying to sell these furnaces for 500k + this year (2100+ furnaces in inventory). Since that has not come to fruition, an Auction is fair to bring back CASH to CREDITORS.

B) Will the auction of furnaces go well?

another bet, the way I see it is any cash back to GT will be beneficial. GT will not sell these furnaces any other way during chapter 11. They have tried and have not succeeded. (Demand for furnaces are at a low right now, hence why GTAT wants to retain 600 or so furnaces for FUTURE sale)

If GT has CASH, it is put in a better position to negotiate with creditors and possibly allow shareholders to retain SOME of the CO in a plan of reorganization.

Do I see this play being amazing as a long term play? I really can't tell. I guess it will come down to how well the auction is + how plan negotiations go. I will follow up this post for a long term position at the end of this month.

As for short term? I am pretty confidant that speculation from the public will drive this price up!

While I understand there is going to be a ceiling on the stock price (shouldn't go much higher than 34.90), shouldn't there also be a reasonable floor? I mean a discount to acquisition price is expected to compensate for the risk of the acquisition failing and for the time value of money while it is held up in stock not paying dividends. BUT a 7.5% discount to acquisition price seems a bit steep for an acquisition anticipated to be completed by early 2016. Thoughts here?",1

15-11-05,[Aleph Blog] One Dozen Thoughts on Dealing with Risk in Investing for Retirement (h/t Reformed Broker),"http://alephblog.com/2015/10/31/one-dozen-thoughts-on-dealing-with-risk-in-investing-for-retirement/

Don't miss the article for the full details, here's the conclusion:

&gt;Conclusion

&gt;Some will think this is unduly dour, but this is realistic.  There are not enough resources to give all of the Baby Boomers a lush retirement, without unduly harming younger age cohorts, and this is true over most of the developed world, not just the US.

&gt;Even with skilled advisers helping, retirees need to be ready for the hard choices that will come up. They should think through them earlier rather than later, and take some actions that will lower future risks.

&gt;The basic idea of retirement investing is how to convert present excess income into a robust income stream in retirement.  Managing a pile of assets for income to live off of is a challenge, and one that most people are not geared up for, because poor planning and emotional decisions lead to subpar results.

&gt;Retirees should aim for the best future investment opportunities with a margin of safety, and let the retirement income take care of itself.  After all, they can’t rely on the markets or the policymakers to make income opportunities easy.",2

The data is overdue. They enrolled patients in August for a 7 week study, and they promised data ASAP. The stock has been hovering at an all-time low for awhile now, and won't be pushed any further. This is a late-stage biotech company with a robust platform and analyst targets of $7 a share. 

I believe that a positive data release will be the the start of a run upward. Expect a data release either tomorrow or early next week. A buy under $1.15 should see you a good 20% upon release, if the data is good. I'm looking for a $1.30 sell target. However, if you choose to hold, catalysts are stacked into Q1 that should further appreciate the stock.

Today, technology companies have largely avoided initial public offerings because of the availability of private funding. Many that have gone public have performed poorly, offering little incentive for others to do so — and, some investors say, signaling a cooling in late-stage valuations as investors scale back. Meanwhile, hot biotechnology stocks are raising questions about another bubble in the public markets.

15-11-05,"Regarding $AVXL's CTAD abstract","There seems to be some confusing over what the abstract is suggesting so I want to clear up some of the terminology. First, people are overreacting to the phrase, ""preliminary analysis of data from subjects shows an average improvement of the MMSE score at week 5"" -- in a scientific context, this does not mean the improvement was, subjectively, average. It means that *on average*, the patients improved in MMSE. 

Also, I'm not sure which is the most recent version of the abstract, the one that's floating around here: http://www.ctad-alzheimer.com/sites/ctad.prod/files/files/CTAD%20Anavex%20Abstract%20confidential%20final%20Nov%202015.pdf, or the gigantic compendium of all participant abstracts here: http://www.ctad-alzheimer.com/sites/ctad.prod/files/files/ABSTRACTS%20CTAD2015.pdf. Given the content of the two, I'm inclined to believe it is the latter that is most recently updated. 

If you look at the latter, there are two major phrasing distinctions. First, the phrase about average MMSE improvement says: ""In the secondary outcome endpoints preliminary analysis of data from subjects *to date* shows an average improvement of the MMSE score at *week 12 in PART B (week 17 from baseline)*,"" rather than 5 weeks. As many of you may know, the complete part A data is only a relatively short 36 day trial, after which, a 52-week open label extension on the trial continued for patients choosing to stay in. Second, the added to word ""significant"" to ""majority of all patients"" is important because in science, significant means *statistically* significant, not just a synonym for substantial, so that should some assuage concerns about validity of a small trial sample. 

Given the enrollment times of the first patients in the trial, we can estimate the majority are more than 3 months in to the extension, with some as much as 6 to 9 months into it. If they are able to present some early data showing improved efficacy over current therapies well past the initial phase (~4 months post treatment to date), this would be a far more compelling presentation rather than simply the complete part A data for the whole cohort. 

I've added this disclaimer before: my field of research is NOT Alzheimer's, so a lot of my information comes just from reading scientific literature and the internet, so take what I say with as much a grain of salt as anyone else. I don't know what the prescription criteria are here in the United States, but based on this source from Australia (http://www.nps.org.au/publications/health-professional/nps-radar/2011/november-2011/brief-item-alzheimers-change-listing), 6 months on a current treatment is more or less a benchmark for whether or not a patient should continue it, assuming no major adverse side effects. At this point, the patient has to ""demonstrate cognitive improvement"" to the tune of &gt;=2 on the MMSE to justify continuing treatment. 

So that's the number for us to watch when Drs. Macfarlane and co. present the complete set of results. All the usual caveats apply about a drug in development -- but based on the enrollment timeline above, some patients should be nearing the end of the whole 52-weeks and Missling is still giddy with excitement, which bodes well.

EDIT: MMSE scores are out 30. The &gt;= burden of proof is associated with scores 10 - 24, representing a more severe diagnosis than the inclusion criteria of Anavex's study, which looks for ""mild to moderate"" AD cases and scores of 16-28. This means there is less numerical range on this scale for MMSE scores to improve since the cases are not as severe, so if A2-73 can get &gt;=2 improvement, that's even more impressive! ",19

15-11-05,Anyone investing in mid-cap stocks?,"Most of the attention seems to go to either mega-cap stocks (for example those in the S&amp;P500) or to small stocks. What do people think about mid-cap stocks and whether they are attractive or not?

To provide a bit of context, here are some numbers I calculated this morning for US stocks sorted by market cap (from 1926 through last month). Each of the quintile portfolios are value weighted.

**Stats for smallest quintile to biggest quintile (sorted by mkt cap)**

Average monthly returns:
1.30,  1.22,  1.17,  1.08,  0.89

(so clear evidence of monotonic ""size premium"" at least over the full sample)

Annualized Sharpe Ratio (= monthly SR * sqrt(12))

0.39,  0.43,  0.45,  0.44,  0.41

(smallest stocks least attractive from a simple risk-return perspective)

Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)

11.74,  11.97, 11.90,  11.19,  9.51

(note how the smallest quintile doesn't have the highest holding period returns although there still is a difference between the smallest and biggest.)


The mid-caps stocks seem to have done relatively well yet seem somewhat ignored, at least in public perception.

I want to start buying and selling stocks short term and repetitively but wish to avoid being labeled as a day trader. I'll tell you my plan and you tell me where I don't know what I am doing.

Basically I want to buy a stock then sell it as soon as I can make a decent gain be that at the end of the day, week or whatever. After I sell the stock I would then move on to a different stock and try to do the same thing. If I did this over the course of a week I could probably go through 5-10 trades with all different stocks.

It is my (poor) understanding that day trading rules only affect trades on the same stock? What are day trading rules with this type of trading? How long do I have to wait until I could repeat stock selections? Anything else you think would be applicable would help tremendously! thank you

Of those I follow, WFT, PXD, NOV, DO, NBR, XOM, SLB, and RIG all had short-term sell signals.  Given how strong the sector has been of late, this is more likely a chance to take profits rather than a time to enter shorts.

It should be noted, however, that equipment bellwether Baker Hughes (BHI) hardly rallied with the sector, held no gains, and now appears to be heading for new lows, making it a prime short candidate when the overall market gives a timing sell.

But in case this is the very beginning of a new swing sell, it can be played with ETFs — shorting XLE, OIH, or with 3X leverage, buying ERY on the open tomorrow for scalps with tight stops.

Just my opinion, as Dennis Miller used to say, I could be wrong.

15-11-05,The case for Bitcoin,"I posted this on my blog a couple of weeks ago, and since Bitcoin has been getting a lot of press lately I thought r/investing might be interested. Also r/bitcoinmarkets pretty much hated it and told me to post it here instead. 


I won't be going in too deep of the underlying technology behind it, cause, you know..it's boring as shit. Of course the technology part is of great importance, but it's better explained by math/computer geeks - aka smart people. In short, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network containing units (bitcoins) that can be transferred in the system with zero to low costs. These units can themselves incorporate other pieces of data. Every transaction is verified by the computers running the system. The math behind it makes it impossible for any entity to mess with this process of continuous update of the ledger. The ledger being a sort of receipt which contains all previous transactions in the network. To break the system you would need to muster up more than half of the systems combined computer power. Discounting the possibility of quantum computing this would be incredibly expensive and/or impossible. Which is why banks around the world are working with this technology (not Bitcoin but the block-chain tech) to make tradingsystems where traders can buy/sell stocks. But to understand why Bitcoin is a good hedge, we need to understand money and the fragility of our current economy, and why this might lead to a lot of demand for bitcoins.


**Money**

Money is one of man’s greatest inventions. Since we left the barter system and started using mediums of exchange, different types of mediums has been used for trading. Gold, grain, salt amongst others, gold obviously being the most famous one. The right to redeem those papers you hold in your wallet for gold ended in a peculiar fashion with the death of Bretton Woods, and ever since then, we've been trading in fiat.(1). Like art, the intrinsic value of gold is definitely questionable. Yes, everyone does seem to desire gold, still it has very limited usefulness. Paper money being a lot worse, one could argue these unredeemable paper notes are worth as much as regular paper. But the fact that you need this fiat-money to pay taxes gives the market certainty of demand in the future, which I believe is the main reason why the markets are able to attribute these notes value.


**Governmental control of money**

As fiat became the predominant transmitter of wealth in our economy, governmental control over money increased. From a naive standpoint that power shift could seem unsignificant, but I would argue it has given us a profound shift in real economic activities. Money in the form of gold had a certain inflation built in to it, since people continuously dig it up from the ground. Yet the gold-economy saw price deflation as production became more efficient, thanks to the invisible hand of the market and advancements in technology. These deflationary powers were at times greater than the inflation coming from new gold findings. This might seem a little off topic but what I want to say is that price-deflation has historically been the norm, and shouldn't be viewed as dangerous. In todays fiat-world however, we hear about central banks trying to fight deflation, believing such an environment would be bad for the labour market. The main argument being that workers have a hard time accepting lower nominal wages, and that this causes overwhelming troubles for companies when they have to cut labour costs. Although fairly logical, I think this theory is disputed by our economic history and should in my opinion definitely not be taken as a fact. However, today when we hear about central banks fighting deflation, what they're really fighting is a credit crunch. Debt, also a form of money, has been growing increasingly for quite some time, driven of course by both fiscal and monetary policy actions. A deleveraging of debt would shrink the amount of debt-money, largely concentrated in stocks/bonds/real estate. This is what central banks are fighting, their job is basically to get this overly leveraged economy, more leveraged. Needless to say, we're in uncharted territory and their might be huge systemic risks involved. Bitcoin may be one way to hedge against this.


**Government deficits and unfunded liabilities**

At which rate would you be willing to loan money to Greece? This one is really a no-brainier, meaning you shouldn't have to think to come up with an answer, since Greece wouldn't pay you back either way. Greece has a enormous debt and a whole lot of unfunded liabilities. These unfunded liabilities are mostly consisting of workers pensions and healthcare obligations to the greek people. Greek politicians will always rank these payment obligations as a higher priority expenditure than to give ""greedy speculators"" back their money. That simple fact holds true for most government bonds. Therefore I think almost all government bonds are worth substantially less than they are being priced today.  Right now the market deems these bonds as low-risk assets. For example, the U.S 10-year bond yields around 2%. In other words; you'll get close to no return (if the FED manages to reach close to its inflation target) for loaning out your money to the worlds largest debtor nation for a period of ten years. This anomaly is so great and profound, it should be viewed as a major indicator on just how messed up things have become. How did we get these absurd yields? Well, demand for bonds drive the yields down, and ever since the financial crisis central banks like the FED and ECB has been on a buying spree. Speculators joined them in their buying and have been betting on the the continuing bondpurchasing from the CB's, or holding a belief that the CB's will be unable to reach inflation targets, basically taking a bet on deflation. In a real market economy (not driven by central banks) with a low savings rate like the United States, these bonds would yield a lot more. The fact is the U.S, much like Greece, can’t repay its debt, ever, it’s impossible, nope, can’t be done. The U.S national debt is around 18 trillion dollars and their unfunded liabilities sums up to another whopping 210 trillion (as testified to congress by Boston university economic professor Laurence Kotlikoff).(2) Even though a lot of these future expenditures as Kotlikoff is including in his measurment could be slashed, some of them, like pensions, are going to be extremely unpopular to cut. If you listen to austrian economists they are pretty much all agreeing, proclaiming that the writing has been on the wall for quite some time.


**Fear of haircuts**

If this whole experiment with low interest rates fails, and economic chaos indeed ensues, I expect governments around the world to act in a similar fashion as seen in Greece/Argentine. Bank depositors will most likely have to take a haircut on their deposits to refinance the banking system. I believe the threat of this bail-in approach to reach debt-equilibrium in the financial world, will drive people to assets which cannot be confiscated. And if you don't think bail-in is a high probabilty event in your country, here's Reuters reporting on the new bail-in legislation: ""Bail-in legislation is now being extended to other EU countries, regardless of whether they're in the Euro or not.""(3).We’ve already seen some correlations of the Bitcoin price with bad economic sentiment, and I expect that trend to catch on as time proceeds. The most clear cut example of this we got during the summer, with the increase in demand for bitcoins during the Greek-crisis. The day Greece reached an agreement with its creditors- Bitcoin dropped 12%. Yet, recent volatility in global stocks has not been accompanied with upward pressure on Bitcoin. When Dow Jones fell a thousand points intraday, Bitcoin fell as well. Suggestion the link between financial instability and the value of bitcoins at least for now is rather weak. But take a look at Argentine and their post collapse economy and you'll find something very interesting. After suffering a bond market collapse and soaring inflation, it is here where bitcoin is having the most impact as an actual money transmitter. As NYT notes ”Argentine has been quietly gaining renown in technology circles as the first, and almost only place where bitcoins are being regularly used by ordinary people for real commercial transactions.”(4)


**Valuation and risk**

First of all, one should obviously not invest more than what's bearable to lose, since there's a nontrivial chance of bitcoin having the value of zero in the future. I also don't want to be responsible for anyone losing a big piece of their net worth, but if you invest your money according what someone on the internet with the name ""UngNaiv"" (young and foolish) you probably have no one to blame but yourself. Anyway, today Bitcoin have a market cap of about 4.5 billion dollars. Besides a small market cap, the uncertainty of demand and the arguably lack of intrinsic value is two of its biggest weaknesses. Even if you believe in the idea of a digital currency, Bitcoin is far from the only one out there. There's competition in the form of other cryptocurrencies with similar but different properties, and only the future will tell which of these (if any) will come out on top. As for now though, Bitcoin has established itself as the clear frontrunner. There is also a high governmental risk involved. If our political leaders start seeing this digital money as a threat to its powers of taxation, or fears grow about what it might do to enable shady transactions, it will certainly go out of its way to try and stop it. Even though the Bitcoin as a system itself is resiliencent to government intervention, one could easily foresee regulation aimed to strangle Bitcoin companies operating in the real world, making mass adoption a lot less likely. So far the western world haven’t cracked down too much on Bitcoin, in some places it has even been declared as a currency, not a commodity, meaning any potential gains in one's holding in those countries would be free from taxation. I'll leave the risks of the underlying technology to be explained by someone else, but google the words Bitcoin+fork and you'll find another very good reason not to go full retard in bitcoins.

I recently opened an investment account through USAA. I have savings, credit, etc. with them, and they offered 50 free trades so it seemed like a good choice for a brokerage account. I also have some stock that I inherited, that my mother has been holding on Computershare. Now that I have my own brokerage account, i'd like to transfer those shares over just to have everything in one place.
I started the process, and to be honest it seems a bit convoluted. I did everything online, and they basically told me to print out some paper work, get it signed by everyone involved, get it notorized, mail it to Computershare, they'll mail me something back, then i'll have my own account on there. And even when all of that is done I still will have not even begun the process of moving them to USAA. 

Is this just how it works, or am I doing something wrong?

15-11-06,"BlackBerry made a $700 Android phone, and it's really good","The BlackBerry Priv is a solid performer with good looks, unique and robust features, and a great camera. The only thing that lets it down is the $700 price tag.

That's pricey for an Android phone, especially when others like Google's new Nexus phones, Motorola's Moto X Pure, and HTC One A9 offer an overall similar experience for under $500. You'd essentially be spending an extra $200 or so for the slide-out keyboard and the promise of BlackBerry's security.

Still, Apple, Samsung, LG, and HTC have shown that people are willing to spend upward of $650 for smartphones, so there's always a chance people will pony up.

And if you find yourself longing for a phone with a physical keyboard that can still run all your favorite apps, the Priv is pretty much your only option.

Valeant Pharma issues a statement on sales of its stock; 1,297,399 shares pledged to Goldman Sachs to secure loans made to CEO Michael Pearson were sold   (78.77)
Co stated that 1,297,399 shares pledged to Goldman Sachs to secure loans made to chairman and chief executive officer J. Michael Pearson were sold by Goldman Sachs on November 5, 2015. Goldman Sachs held the shares as collateral for loans extended to Pearson.
As disclosed in the company's proxy statement filed on April 22, 2014, the company's board permitted Pearson to pledge approximately two million shares. As of the company's most recent proxy statement, filed April 9, 2015, those shares represent approximately 20.19% of his shares beneficially owned. Pearson pledged those shares to Goldman Sachs as collateral for loans of approximately $100 million that he used for, among other things, financing charitable contributions, including to Duke University, and helping to fund a community swimming pool, purchasing Valeant shares, and meeting certain tax obligations related to the vesting and payment of Valeant compensatory equity awards.
In January 2015, Pearson agreed to not receive a base salary and instead be compensated exclusively through cash and stock incentive awards tied to performance.

15-11-06,Wells Fargo to pay $81.6 million in bankruptcy settlement,"Wells Fargo &amp; Co., has agreed to pay $81.6 million to settle claims it failed to notify thousands of bankrupt homeowners that it was increasing their mortgage payments in violation of federal bankruptcy law.The U.S. Trustee Program, the arm of the Justice Department that oversees the nation’s bankruptcy courts, said Thursday that the San Francisco bank WFC, +2.53%  has agreed to pay homeowners for repeatedly violating a 2011 bankruptcy law requiring them to notify the homeowners of any changes in their mortgage payments.

The law at issue requires mortgage lenders to give people who have filed for protection under chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code 21 days’ notice before raising their mortgage payments. Under chapter 13, a person can keep big assets such as a home or car while repaying their debts over a three- to five-year period.The Justice Department said Wells Fargo acknowledged that it failed to file more than 100,000 notices involving homeowners in bankruptcy between Dec. 1, 2011, and March 31 of this year. The bank said it failed to conduct 18,000 escrow analyses in cases involving nearly 68,000 accounts of homeowners in bankruptcy during the same time period.

The bulk of the settlement cash—some $53.6 million—is earmarked for more than 42,000 homeowners whose mortgage payments increased without notification. Another $10 million will be credited to debtors’ accounts at the end of their bankruptcy cases.",2

Or at least a significant portion. 3 days seems to be a bit of a magic number. 3 days before the catalyst, cash in a large portion of your initial investment. From then on you're playing with play money. Who gives a damn if that DD you read completely misread the situation?

I'm actually thinking I may start fully cashing out 3 days prior then buying back even more at the almost inevitable 1/2 day prior cash out crash.

*Make up your own mind about the DD*

For example /u/pcx99 knows what he's talking about but he's not been 100% correct every time. Look into the points made and see if you agree with the interpretation.

*DON'T WORRY IF YOU'VE MISSED THE BOAT*

There's plenty more ships in the sea.

*10% in a day is more than twice what you'd get in a savings account in a single year*

Less a rule more something to keep in mind. Compound 2% gains over 100 days and you'll have 7.2x what you started with. Seriously, just a 2% gain. Of course no one ever wins that well but if you sim for lower but more consistent gains it will stack up.

Uhhhh, anything else? Probably but I should be working on this report I'm actually being paid to write.",20

- Earnings report for Q3 2015 Iconix Brand Group Earnings Conference Call (Live) 11/09/15 at 8:30 a.m. ET

.

Nov 6, 2015

Now here is where it gets fun. 

1. Following an accounting review by a special committee of the company's board of directors, Iconix announced that it would need to restate some of its financial results from fiscal 2013, 2014, and the first two quarters of 2015 in order to correct accounting errors (oh-oh). What followed was the obvious crash that made this stock plummet from its [usual $16 range to $6.90](https://www.google.com/finance?cid=361840) (AH) or -57%. Because seriously, lying about financial is like the ultimate sin at the stock market and there is little mercy.


2. Inconix also provided preliminary results for the third quarter, which will include three special items: It will take a $12.2 million charge to increase reserves related to its accounts receivables. A $3.8 million tax-related charge will be taken to correct an error in the company's 2014 federal tax return.  The company will take $7.1 million in charges related to the accounting review, correspondence with the SEC, and severance costs related to the transition of the company's management.


3. Lastly, Iconix slashed its guidance for the full year. Licensing revenue is expected to be between $370 million and $380 million, down from a previous range of $410 million to $425 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1.35 and $1.40, down from previous guidance of $2.00 to $2.15.

4. Nonetheless the CEO is all like: Look, at least we came out. The cat is out of the sack, there you go. It's not like we gonna go away. We will recover from that. Obviously he didn't literally say that, but read between the lines

Technical Analysis aka Voodoo:
--

Now usually I would post a bunch of screenshots, but the current drop is so out of pattern, technical analysis would be useless other than stating the obvious that this stock is either where it is supposed to be or it is extremely undersold.

Personal opinion:
--

Okay, I bought into this bitch 128 shares avg $7.07. To you that might not be much but to me it's a big part of my portfolio. Seen it drop the whole day. It is important to note that the drop today was a reaction to all the news in the DD above calculating in the adjustments to all previous financial reports, the taxes they owe, the SEC penalties, the pessimistic expectations towards the earnings report that will drop 8:30am before the market opens. So, in my opinion and maybe /u/hypnotwist can back me up, this cannot get any lower than this. The punishment has already happened. 

If there is even the slightest hope of good news in the earnings report, this thing will shoot up. Crazy voodoo technical analysts would say that it is bound to fill the gap ($8-15). I don't believe in that type of crap but I have seen it happening before.

But, if the earnings report is even lower than the preliminary estimates after all the adjustments, this thing could hit $5. Now maybe I do wanna do some little technical analysis:

https://i.imgur.com/SHsWb1i.jpg

This does not look like a stock that wants to recover to me. This looks more like people expect more bad news to come and rather jump than holding the bag over the weekend. I for one decided to hold the bag. Like they say, you don't lose until you have sold (horrible advice). I believe in the rebound. Let the bad news and shorts pass and this will be on its way to recovery. You might have to hold it for a week or two, but it will be back to at least $9.


I wrote this for all of you who are undecided and want to buy in AH or early Monday. If you buy on Monday, DEFINITELY try to find news about the earnings report and how the pre-market reacts to it first before anything! Keep an eye on it. Put it on your watchlist. Enjoy.

15-11-06,"Telesta Therapeutics (TST.TO, BNHLF) Up 9% Today, Ahead of November 18th FDA Adcom","Yes, I am pumping a little bit, but great things are happening with this company. Please google the article ""Telesta Therapeutics Could Generate Multi-Bagger Returns""

From said article:
""On November 18, a major catalyst could generate multi-bagger returns for Telesta Therapeutics (OTCPK:BNHLF) shareholders. This Phase 3 company will be reporting whether or not the FDA's advisory committee has recommended the FDA approve Telesta's lead drug; MCNA. If FDA approval is recommended, Telesta will be worth at least 6 times today's valuation.
The advisory committee's decision is important because the FDA follows the committee's recommendation 88% of the time, so a thumbs up for Telesta's drug will mean probable FDA approval. It also explains why investors could see such dramatic share price appreciation following a positive decision.
But what makes this such an exceptional trade is that Telesta is so undervalued that it should be trading significantly higher even without the upcoming catalyst. The company is currently valued at $90 million, and when we look at similar comps, fair valuation for Telesta should be at least $600 million. This is an extreme level of mispricing and creates an ideal trade; undervaluation combined with a near-term catalyst. It's also important to realize that we could see a significant run-up in anticipation of a positive decision.
Telesta's drug should capture major market share
Telesta's MCNA appears to be the most effective and safest second-line treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. When a patient is diagnosed with bladder cancer, he is given the first-line treatment, BCG. Approximately 60% of these patients ultimately relapse and at that point the best option is to remove the bladder and surrounding organs. Most patients decline surgery for obvious reasons.
For patients who are not eligible for the surgery, the only option is to use FDA approved Valstar, which has a 10% disease-free 12 month survival rate, and creates chemotherapy induced side effects.
MCNA provides a much better option for all patients because clinical studies have demonstrated that 25% of the patients treated with MCNA survive disease-free for 12 months. In patients with papillary only tumors, the disease-free survival rate was 32% at 2 years. That's more than 3 times the efficacy of Valstar.
For second line cancer treatments, 25% is considered a home run because the alternative is usually near-term death. That's why the FDA approved Valstar with a 10% one year disease-free survival rate.
I believe Telesta will become the market leader, because my research has demonstrated most people would choose the MCNA option over surgery or Valstar, I certainly would.""",10

INTRO

This is a pretty low risk play with a lot to be gained.

THE COMPANY

Relypsa recently got FDA approval for its drug, Veltassa. Veltassa is used for the treatment of Hyperkalemia, it is also the only new treatment in 50 years. Recently, Relypsa announced that 1/3 of their saleforce has been hired, which showed in their Q3 ER losses. RLYP actually went down in SP when it was approved, mainly as an overreaction to receiving a ""Do not take within 6 hours of other medications"" label because it binds to other medications. It is now recovering from this. Relypsa didn't expect this label, as the drug only binded to roughly half the drugs they tested invitro. They also think it was a very conservative estimate, since drugs cycle through the body in roughly 4 hours if taken orally(which it is). RLYP is making a case to have the label removed/reduced in the coming months.


THE FINANCES


ZSPH, their only competition in hyperkalemia was just bought out for $90/share. Their product is due for approval in May 2016, meanwhile RLYP will have been selling already, and gaining valuable market space. Financials are bad for Relypsa right now as it stands, since they just got FDA approval for their only drug. The company is valued at 510.39M, while peak sales are projected to be north of $1 Billion/year in the US alone. I feel like this is a very undervalued stock, as do many analysts (except JP Morgan). Also recently(11/4), an S-3 was filled for up to $300M in additional funding by Cantor Fitzgerald &amp; Co.


THE PLAY


I'd consider this a play on Q1 - 2016 earnings because Veltassa launches the first week in Jan. 2016. There are many things that could happen between then though. I think any entry under $20 would be worth taking, as price targets have been set at 35,55, and 75 by EOY. I don't believe these price targets hold much value for EOY targets, but seem like reasonable estimates for Q1 results, with $75 being a little out there.

Firstly, there are a number of rumours of buyout since ZSPH was bought out with an inferior drug that isn't approved yet. Secondly, this stock will pop if the black label is removed, as binding is the ONLY side-effect and this can be used on dialysis patients. 
Thirdly, RLYP will still move north as they announce data and sign large contracts with practices.

RISKS


I would consider ZSPH's drug a risk, but if you are selling on Q1 results, no matter how good their drug is, they can't sell it before May 2016. Below I will outline the major differences between the two drugs.

*Drug Forms* - Edge -&gt; ZS-9(ZS Pharma) It is both an Oral suspension powder and dissolvable tablet, where as Veltassa is just powder.

*Water needed to disolve* - Edge -&gt; Veltassa. Only 40ml of water is needed. ZS-9 needs 240ml for powder, 40-120 for tablet

*Storage time* - Edge -&gt; ZS-9. Can be stored for 36 months. Veltassa lasts 3 months.

*Exchange Ion* - Edge -&gt; Veltassa. Calcium. This means no calcium overload. ZS-9 uses Sodium and hydrogen, which causes an edema side effect(legs and eyes swell)

*Time to K normalization* - Edge -&gt; ZS-9. 2.2hrs instead of 48. Gives ZS-9 potential to capture acute hyperkalemia share.

I consider the lack of side effects and less water needed to be larger advantages to have, as water is very important to conserve with hyperkalemia patients. ZS-9 will overall be better in emergency situations, but causes side effects and will be late to market.

DISCLOSURE


I am new to stocks. I believe I did an okay job with my DD, but please do your own. I own a position in RLYP at an average of $16.79. Please critic my DD, and provide any extra input you have. I want to know if I have the whole picture.

If I receive $10 in dividends then my shares drop in value by $1.00 each leaving me with $90. By reinvesting my dividend I then buy more shares bringing me to the same value I had before but now I have more shares. To me the dividend earned seems like a wash?

15-11-07,How to go about researching before quarterly reports?,"So I am in College and taking a new finance class. 

Recently I got an assignment to write a paper on how we expect a designated company to do with regards to their quarterly earnings before they release their quarterly reports in a week or two. I got Walmart, which is reporting on November 17th. 

Our assignment is basically to research how some of the top investment banks estimate the company will do, analyze what the driving factors are for why believe this, and synthesize all the info to give our own hypothesis on if we think the company will beat or fall short of the consensus estimate. 

My problem so far is that I am finding it impossible to find detailed reports. All I can find so far is the actual consensus estimate, but I can't find any detailed reports on why the company expects that. Or I have to pay ridiculous amounts of money I don't have to access them.

Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Introduction
--
Natural gas is a fossil fuel formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure over thousands of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in natural gas. Natural gas is a nonrenewable resource because it cannot be replenished on a human time frame. So natural gas has one thing in common with us: Yolo.

Background and Recent Events
--

So Imma just shamelessly copypasta some of /u/gabriel87120's DD on the future of oil. [A great read up btw](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3rjts6/the_future_of_oil_dd_included/). 

Because the main reason GASL is going up is also why oil is going down down down

So why did oil plummet starting last summer? The short answer was a US and global oversupply. The USA was getting fancy touting our shale gas boom that became profitable with oil at $100 or over. You would hear words like ""LNG revolution,"" and see announcements for billion dollar facilities (like the FLNG plant in Freeport, Tx being designed by CB&amp;I). You'd see these EPC stocks flying through the roof when they'd announce the projects (nearly 50% for CB&amp;I over a five month period early this year).

I used to design LNG facilities for a living as an engineer, so in laymen's terms LNG is a hydrocarbon capable of making everything from fuel to plastic to whatever oil makes...and it's here in our backyards with all these shale gas drillers you hear about digging it up. Nat Gas was dirt cheap and at that time in such abundance that most refineries just burned it for fuel (because nobody was buying it). With oil over $100, it was a no-brainer for companies to invest billions into developing an internal LNG infrastructure to convert natural gas into a usable form (liquid). Because it's completely ridiculous to transport a gas, but if you liquefy it, you can cram nearly 50 times the amount of product on the same truck. That's why the ""L"" in LNG was important. You compress and chill natural gas in huge facilities to turn it into a liquid you can transport... and now your LNG infrastructure is competitive with the world's refining stage. There were hopes of ""complete energy independence"" being the talk of the town in the energy world because of this, and even I was getting job offers left and right. (I was the engineering lead for a piece of the FLNG FEED stage project). The Saudi's and other OPEC companies didn't like the idea of us needing their oil less. Their response: they flooded the market while simultaneously shorting to drop the price of oil to make oil compete with the cheap natural gas. And with this, oil tanked hard. And with it, pretty much all future LNG stuff grinded to a halt.

Hence where we are today. Near oil's bottom. Yes I'm calling a bottom. $38 was it, and it's not going back...and if it does, it will not be for long. Argue with me, love what I'm saying, that's up to you. But oil has failed to go below $40 twice now, even with the dollar shooting up to all time highs oil is not plummeting. This last month has proven the support of the trading world of the $40's range.

-----------  /u/gabriel87120

Thank your for the testimony, Gas Reverend.

.

The important thing to take from here is GASL itself has very little news. The news that drive GASL up and down is highly dependent on where oil and coal are going, whether there are technological innovations in the use of gas and whether those innovations are implemented and of course things like oil cartels and catastrophes.

What is GASL?

GASL is the Direxion Daily Natural Gas Related Bull 3x Shares that seeks to represent 300% of the DAILY price performance. It is based off of the International Securities Exchange (ISE) [Revere Natural Gas Index](https://www.ise.com/etf-ventures/index-data/ise-revere-natural-gas-fum/) which primarily focuses on companies that are involved in natural gas-related exploration, research, and production

Sauce: http://www.direxioninvestments.com/products/direxion-daily-natural-gas-related-bull-3x-etf

It is by no means meant to be held for more than a day with the expectation that the weekly price performance reflects 300% of the weekly price performance of the ISE.

The big message here is, these are multinational companies that operate around the globe and thus the index is less affected by the policy of a single country. But, if you go through a bunch of them, you will also notice that oil and gas production usually go hand in hand. But, that's something to worry about for the fund, not for you. All you gotta focus on is that methane.

Financials:
--
Well this is an ETF so financials don't really mean a thing. They are all relative to every single day due to reverse splits, bad stock being weeded out, etc. What I can tell you however is:

Volume: 100,000-400,000 a day. During extreme price fluctuations, you might have issues selling your batch instantly if you placed a limit order.

Technicals and me opinion:
--
During the past three weeks I have managed to exploit a pattern that tends to repeat itself within a [1-2 week window](http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GASL&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=0&amp;p=d). During that window, it will hit a low that is lower than the past window. But once it reaches that point, there is a guaranteed reversal. How high you want to ride it is your choice. Over the past month I have been riding the waves buying in at $21, selling at $24, rinse and repeat. Might seem insignificant but, the difference is 10-25% on a good day. The key is to buy at a point far below the daily opening price and you are almost always guaranteed to get away with it if you have the balls to hold until the very end of the day. I never hold over night because it tends to gap with no explanations.

Now regarding Keystone XL. Obama announced that he will not pursue that deal anymore now that that liberal is running Canada and there is a lot of pressure from environmentalists, Democrats and supporters. Keystone XL was designed for oil, a project proposed and promoted by TransCanada. Now GASL is neither oil, nor do they have [holdings](http://files.direxionfunds.com/DirexionWebsiteFiles/holdings_gasl.csv) in TransCanada, but their risk is spread throughout the world, too. So a thing that is really just a national matter like Keystone XL should not affect GASL significantly in a positive or negative way. GASL will just GASL.

Q/A:
--
Q: But wait, wtf is a leveraged ETF??

A: How is it different from a stock? Well if you put money into an ETF, they basically borrow your money to invest in a bunch of other companies that are related to that ETF's main theme. E.g. YINN focuses on Chinese companies, NUGT on Gold related companies, GASL is gas.

Q: Can I yolo this on Robinhood?

A: Yes. Though I would place the limit buy at around $0.03 lower since RH only shows the ask, and not 
the bid price and there is usually a gap that can be small or very large.

Q: Are you a pumper?

A: No, sir/m'am. ETFs don't work that way.

Q: Who is your idol?

A: Hillary Clinton. Anyone who can turn $2000 in cow futures into $200k and then run for president is a genius.",8

Nissan, Toyota, and Honda are all about to publicly break up with Takata (air bag inflator manfucturer).

This isn't a great DD or insider information, but it's more than nothing.

""Takata said it expects a net profit of 5 billion yen ($41.04 million) in the year to end-March, just a quarter of what it estimated three months ago. The Tokyo-based firm booked a combined special loss of 17.2 billion yen for the April-September period to pay a $70 million fine and legal fees.

The company said it did not expect any major impact this year from its customers dropping its products, and had yet to determine the future effects. Takata does not disclose how much inflators contribute to its overall business, but air bag products accounted for 38 percent of revenue last year.

Bloomberg News reported that Takata had hired SMBC Nikko to draw up a fundraising plan, but a senior Takata executive said the company has no cash flow or financing issues.

""Takata is currently facing no problem in financing,"" Yoichiro Nomura, Takata's executive vice president and chief financial officer, told reporters. ""I'm saying we have no problem from a cash flow perspective.""

**Intro**

First and foremost I'm a swinger so don't expect me to even hold this stock for more than a week, and likewise I don't expect you to hold this stock either. The company and its product line are irrelevant to trading, but its nice to know what the hell the company does in the first place. **Ohr Pharmaceutical Inc treats wet macular degeneration, or in simpler terms, old people losing their vision for aging**. The stock took a huge hit earlier in the year because the board members had ""possible violations of Federal Securities laws"". This news tanked the stock 68.61%. 
I like this stock because its got a decent product line (which I'm alluding to, be patient) and because its chart shows nice price movement, and price movement is good for swinging.

Ohr Pharmaceutical, Inc. is an ophthalmology research and development company whose lead product, Squalamine, is being studied as an eye drop formulation (OHR-102) in several company-sponsored and investigator sponsored Phase II clinical trials for various back-of-the-eye diseases. These diseases include wet-AMD, retinal vein occlusion, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In addition, Ohr has a sustained release micro fabricated micro-particle ocular drug delivery platform with several preclinical drug product candidates in development for glaucoma, steroid-induced glaucoma, ocular allergies, and protein drug delivery. 


""But wait Blackdowney, besides you being mentally handicapped why is this company important"" ""well because... ""An estimated 15 million Americans have age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but unfortunately, most won’t know they have it until they begin to suffer vision loss. AMD is the leading cause of blindness and central vision loss among adults over age 65."" according to The American Society of Retina Specialists""


So how's their drug? 


**Topically administered OHR-102 combination therapy led to improved visual function in patients with wet AMD.**


**Patients with classic containing CNV demonstrated a mean gain in visual acuity at month nine of +11 letters for the OHR-102 combination arm and +5 letters with Lucentis® monotherapy, a clinically meaningful benefit of 6 letters.** In addition, 44% of patients treated with OHR-102 combination therapy gained 3 or more lines of vision compared to only 29% in the Lucentis monotherapy group at month 9.

""So blackdowney, whats the play? do we just YOLO it all away like you did on AVXL?"" 

""look /u/arepleb I dont know what you think but my strategy is to average down on this bitch because recently its picked up momentum. I'd start with 5% of my portfolio, and double my bet averaging down because this company has zero debt, has increased its research and development to 1.5 million for trials, and is trading at a 3 - 3.5 ratio of Market cap to cash. But if your autistic like me, get a long straddle on this bitch, the volume is so low and guess what.... VVVVV

15-11-06,$AVXL - CHILL OUT WSB...Stop throwing your money at a falling knife. Trading education inc...,[deleted],190
15-11-07,A pitch to make WSB an actual company $WSBT.,"Wallstreetbets can become a fund of many traders that share profit, but also share risk. DD would be done by you the gamblers, and you guys would be paid a commission of 10% if the company (Wallstreetbets Inc) makes any money on it. 

Of course not everyone DD's will get chosen. This is where the gamblers as a group can contribute to the growth in two ways. 

Gamblers can buy $WSBT stock (if we got listed on OTC) 
Gamblers can contribute monthly or bulk payments anywhere from 1$ to 100$ to 1000$.

There are 23,000 gamblers so if each person here contributed 1$, and the top 1% contributed 500$ per month, then that would get us $1.6 million in revenue. 


This cash would be matched by stock holders and board members money, and real estate would be purchased where the owners and gamblers would split the rent. 


Meaning if u/blackdowney (board member) got $1.6 million of his own money, he could use 1.6 million from the gamblers, and buy a real estate property of 3.2 million, then split the rent 50-50. 

A person who contributed 1k would get 100$ in a year back to him/her. The company would of course get $160,000 per year, and this money would be used in stocks, with the rent allowing us to average down, or invest more etc. 

The stock of $WSBT would be automatically used for real estate so whatever the market cap would be after an offering (ex. 2 million) we should be making 200,000 in real estate. A nice P.E. of 10 which is better than most low cap stocks. 

You guys make money off whatever you give us (10% per year forever) 

We make money off whatever we put in, and gamble (board members and stock holders)

The cool thing about it is that the steady source of income for both $WSBT and gamblers and it opens up real estate investment on a small scale. Think monopoly when you start small, then eventually buy houses and shit

Anybody still here?

The investigation focuses on whether statements the company made to investors about climate risks as recently as this year were consistent with the company’s own long-running scientific research.

15-11-06,How to post impressive screenshots.,"So on a thread a while back I got to make a SS post of my impressive gains on AVXL.  This was back when AVXL was in $13 land.   And people jumped all over it and were like ""ZOMG how can I be like you?""

So here's how you can be like me.   I first SCREAMED AVXL back in July. When I went YOLO.   I added even more on the dips over the next few weeks until my ave went from $3 to $4.20.   I played AVXL 's swings with even more money until that $4.20 is almost all pure profit (no equity).

But the point is, those amazing gains didn't happen overnight.  It took three months.   If you are hopping onto a rising stock you are buying the run-up and WSB likes to buy in near the very top of that.   (Seriously, how many of you waited to go in until you saw how much other people were making?)

I *LOVE* AVXL and my core is riding the stock wherever it goes.  But you'll notice I haven't screamed AVXL in quite a while because it's no longer undervalued (much).   My recent DD called for $8 on the eve of the conference and $12-$25 **by the end of the year** if the results were spectacular.  How much is AVXL going to grow in three months from $10?   Yes that's a lot of money but it's not WSB money.

So here is how you make money and post impressive screenshots on WSB.   Find out when people are SCREAMING about a truly undervalued stock with some strong catalysts ahead.   Do your research and DD and see if you think they're right.  Put your money in low, and then just friggin wait and be patient.

People actually ride me because I talk about BGMD so much, but I do so because that is the next friggin AVXL.   It's absurdly undervalued waiting for revenues from Abbott Labs to start showing up, and it has an FDA decision due ""soon"" that adds 10x to the value of their test. 

So my next screenshot (and /u/theycallme1 and a few others that follow the stock) will be when BGMD hits their FDA and then people will be all over the stock like white on rice and you know what?  By the time we post our screenshots, the run-up will be near the end and you'll be buying near the top and then wondering why the hell you're the only one on WSB not making money.",28

BNHLF just signed licensing agreements, is meeting a clear unmet need in the bladder cancer space, and will likely generate $400M in sales alone from the US, let alone ex-US sales.

Dividend Yield: 0.39 (1.24%)

About the company:

	NVIDIA is a tech company known for inventing the GPU (graphics processing unit) which NVIDIA explains is the “soul” of the PC. The GPU is dedicated to the graphics of the computer while the CPU (central processing unit) is dedicated to more of everyday computing. NVIDIA targets 4 very large markets which include gaming, graphics, datacenters, and even automobiles. The company focuses on the visual computing for these markets and seems to be pretty good at it.


Notable products:

-The GeForce is NVIDIA’s gaming processor which is the backbone of the PC gaming market. This product helps video games run optimally on each PC the GeForce supports.
-NVIDIA GameWorks is a gaming program that helps video games look more realistic.
-NVIDIA SHIELD competes with products such as Apple TV and Fire TV which is a very competitive field. The SHIELD however seems to have a lot better performance than any TV entertainment device of its kind.
-NVIDIA GRID is a cloud gaming software run in the SHIELD and other devices. The software basically holds all of your games in the cloud. This can be compared to Steam which also holds games.
-Tesla GPUs are used in combination with CPUs to process larger amounts of data for scientific research.
-NVIDIA DRIVE PX is the processor for all of the graphics and data you find in cars.

Recent news:

Annual Gross Profits

2013- $2,226,343
2014- $2,267,763

(In thousands)
2013- $562,536
2014- $439,990
2015- $630,587

NVDA hasn’t been growing exponentially in income. But, the profits have been on the rise year after year. The only knowledgeable conclusion I can come to is NVIDIA is spending a lot more on operating expenses and expanding research in new products and technology. More spending is better than less spending when it comes to growth.

My Opinion:

I would recommend purchasing NVDA as soon as possible. NVIDIA is a long term and small risk investment due an increase in spending and recently landing a major deal with Microsoft. Profits are on the rise and the company has no debts. The gaming industry will always be in the entertainment market and NVIDIA powers the PC and cloud gaming markets. NVIDIA is the leading company in the automobile industry in terms of GPUs for cars. Adding the NVIDIA DRIVE PX programs to the next generation of cars could lead to a major revenue increase as well in the near future. The company also increased its dividend by 18% which shows huge growth and confidence for the company in the future to come.

So this is mah baby. I have been into this company for quite awhile and it seems very promising.

The company has a focus on CD47.

From the website:
""Our lead program, SIRPαFc, targets CD47, a molecule that is expressed at high levels by many different types of cancer cells. CD47 binds to SIRPα on macrophages and delivers a “do not eat” signal that inhibits the ability of macrophages to phagocytose (engulf and destroy) malignant cells. The inhibitory CD47 signal is an important mechanism by which malignant cells escape immune-mediated attack, and high levels of CD47 are correlated with poor patient prognosis in a number of cancers.

SIRPαFc is a fusion protein consisting of a portion of the SIRPα receptor linked to an immunoglobulin Fc region. This antibody-like molecule binds to CD47 on the tumor cells with high affinity and functions as a decoy receptor, preventing malignant cells from delivering the suppressive “do not eat” signal. SIRPαFc enables macrophages to kill tumor cells in vitro (while sparing normal cells) and induces potent anti-tumor effects in vivo.

The SIRPαFc program has transitioned to the Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling phase, with a clinical study anticipated to begin in the second half of 2015. While our initial focus is acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we believe that SIRPαFc holds great promise as an immunotherapy for other hematopoietic cancers and solid tumors. We are also exploring the potential to combine SIRPαFc with other immunotherapies, and are concurrently developing two unique SIRPαFc agents for use as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapies.""

http://trilliumtherapeutics.com/technology/sirpfc/default.aspx

The good:
-Just filed IND and is ready for PH I testing. 
~~-Testing will be faster than normal as this is an orphan drug~~ (This is a different product they have)
-Over $90M in cash, and over 85% institutionally owned.
-Great amount of daily volume, big biohealthcare names are invested
-PT of $30.50 with a strong buy rating from 3 analysts (0 say hold or sell)
-Huge potential of several yearly billion for this product, has potential to be used for more than AML research.
-Great Board
-Has enough cash on hand to get them through Ph II funding
-Excellent pre-clinical results

The bad
-Long time to get profitable/to market
-will need to be funded further/partner to get past Ph 3
-Warrants basically double the amount of shares outstanding
-2 other competitors in the field (although this approach offers best in class)
 
Coming up next is:
-IND approval from FDA (Almost a given).
-Ph I enrollment/results

#**TransCanada Corp.**  (TSX:TRP  NYSE:TRP)  

###Intro
TransCanada Corp is involved in the transport of oil and power generation. They fully own 7 other pipelines, have a stake in an additional 7 pipelines, and own or have a stake in a number of power generating plants. 

This company was behind a little thing called the Keystone XL pipeline.  It was outright rejected this past Friday by President Obama (thanks Obama) contributing to the stock price taking a bit of a hit this past week.  That being said, TransCanada Corp has such a diverse portfolio that this decision will not effected the company in the long run.  

###Risks
Now that Keystone XL was rejected the risk associated with buying the stock is lower.

###Summary 
Financially speaking I believe this company to be fairly valued at the current price per share (CAD$43.42 or US$32.56).  Relative to its peers, it is trading at a discount.  


#**Cameco Corp** (TSX:CCO  NYSE:CCJ)  
###Intro
Cameco is the third largest uranium producer in the world.  They operate a number of uranium mines across Canada and the United States in addition to a refinery and a uranium conversion facility.  They also hold a stake in Bruce Power and thus indirectly involved in Nuclear power generation.  

Cameco’s stock has been in a bit of a slump since the Fukushima disaster in 2011.  Additionally, demand for uranium has been low since reserves are currently extremely high.  However, nuclear power is not going anywhere with over 65 new nuclear power plants currently under construction world wide.  This should prompt annual consumption of uranium to double within the next 10 years.

###Risks
They are currently fighting the Canadian Revenue Agency over taxes owing between 2003-2009.  They could end up paying ~$820 Million if they lose.

I believe this company is a decent buy, as it is currently trading ~$1 above the 52 week low, provided you can stomach the risk associated with it and intend on holding it for 10+ years.

So how would you go about assigning percentages to these ETFs? I looked into doing portfolio optimization but the fact that some of them have negative returns over the past 3 years makes that a fruitless effort. Then I was just thinking ""Well lets do 40% across the US factor based, 40% across the international ETFs, 15% in debt and 5% in gold"" but those are just nice sounding numbers (albeit based on my target asset allocation), but after that they still need to be split among the ETFs under them.

15-11-07,Need some advice on investing in an IRA,"Hey guys, long time lurker here.  I decided to make a throwaway so my friends can't identify who I am.  I have a lot of them on Reddit...

Anyway, I read the wiki and still confused on where to start investing.  I think I got a pretty good understand of what a 401(k) is, some differences between Traditional vs Roth IRA, and a basic idea of what a stock and bond can do... However, I just don't what to do in my situation.  

This brings me to my current situation:
I live a pretty frugal life. Have a good job and living below my means.  Currently I make about 80k annually as an engineer.  And I have been contributing to my 401(k) since day 1 of working for my employer.  That's been 2 years already.  And my employer do a 4% matching.  I have a savings account with Bank of America, and I just hit 50k saving as of this week, so I am qualify to use their Merrill Lynch service.  Apparently they provide a $0 online equity and ETF trades (don't even know what that means).  Anyway I have been thinking of putting some of my money and starting an IRA, but i'm still not sure if Traditional is better than Roth in my current position.  My question for you guys is should I start an IRA using Merrill Lynch or Vanguard.  The wiki recommends Vanguard for being cheap to start up but since I hit platinum status with BoA should I take advantage of that?  Need some advice.",1

To avoid that kind of situation again, I will write here first, the objective facts about the study and from Anavex's presentation, and then, separately, my opinion on it (disclaimer: I am long), so that everyone can assess the results for themselves. 

--
**The clinical study**

&gt; Purpose: The primary objective of this Phase 2a study is to evaluate the maximal tolerated dose of ANAVEX2-73 in patients with AD in a repeated-dose administration scheme, with the secondary objectives being to explore the relationship between dosing regimen and pharmacodynamics efficacy outcomes and to evaluate the bioavailability of the oral form used and to explore the relationship of ANAVEX2-73 as add-on therapy to AD standard of care.
(source: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02244541)

The *primary* purpose of the study is to study safety and dose tolerance in the subjects; however, as *secondary endpoints*, they measured a battery of cognitive function metrics, some of which were presented including MMSE, ADCS-ADL, and EEG/ERP for exploratory purposes; and bioavailability of the oral capsule formulation. 

The format of the study is as follows:

*Part A:* There are 32 total subjects, 16 male and 16 female. Lasting five weeks, the partial data from this part of the study was presented on 7/22 as interim data. Over 33 days, the patients took A2-73 in oral form for 11 days -- stopped taking it for another 11 to during a washout period -- and then took it for another 11 days in IV form. The dosing of this on-off-on administration scheme was also not yet optimized. 

*Part B:* Optionally, after Part A, patients are given the option to continue taking an oral form of A2-73 in either 30mg or 50mg, to establish a longer safety and effect record than the relatively short Part A and to assess the two dosing regimens. All 32 participants requested to continue on with the optional Part B of the study, and it was at the request of the participants or their caregivers that the original 26-week length of Part B be extended to 52 weeks. 

--
*Analysis:* It seems a misconception about the results were that they were going to *prove* the effectiveness of A2-73 as the drug of the future beyond a doubt. That's not the primary endpoint here, not in P2a, which is generally focused on safety and dosing. Those metrics as a primary endpoint are typically reserved for P2b and P3; however, as secondary endpoints, they can still give an early look at the promise of a drug, and when taken as such, those results are **not** meaningless. 

Two things did stand out to me. First, the tolerability and promising early results despite the lack of any dose optimization -- in fact, Part A was not even a continuous administration of the drug. Second, that every patient chose to continue and are the reason Part B was extended. Keeping in mind the timeline for rolling patient enrollment, this makes sense, as the earliest subjects should be roughly nine months into Part B now. 

--
**The CTAD results**

*Safety:* The drug is previously known to be safe and well-tolerated. More specific information is not available from the pictures taken of the slides at the conference.

*MMSE:* The patients improved their MMSE scores by 1.5 (the median) from their baseline measurement in prior to beginning treatment. This was done in Part A, with the unoptimized on-off-on treatment.

*Cogstate Tasks:* Patients improved scores from their baseline in 5 of 6 tasks, two of which were statistically significant improvements. 

*ADCS-ADL:* The baseline in this study is not the very beginning, but rather from week 5, the start of Part B. The patients exhibited on average an improvement of 3.21 points on this metric. 11/14 patients improved their scores at this checkpoint. 

*P300:* The subjects improved by an average of 80% over baseline in measurements of P300 amplitude, which measures the shape of brainwaves. In addition, task accuracy, false alarms, and reaction time were improved by 85%, 104%, and 66% respectively. AD patients are shown to have a characteristic brainwave that is quantifiably different than healthy controls, and this metric correlates strongly with ADAS-Cog and MMSE in previous reporting and scientific publications. 


--
*Analysis:* Though not statistically significant, the error bars for MMSE on the verge of not overlapping. The change in score is a pretty good number for just 5 weeks of unoptimized treatment, and only actually taking the drug for 2/3 of that time, when you consider that some guidelines consider +1.5-2 efficacious over 6 months to a year with donepezil. I would have liked to see MMSE data for week 17 though.

Now let's talk about ADCS-ADL: the confidence intervals for ADCS-ADL at week 12 (which is really week 17) are not great to be sure. But to me, while the exact numbers for change in score (a whopping +3.21) versus baseline is not statistically significant, just the fact that 11 out of 14 patients actually *improved* their score is notable. Why? 

To put this in context, Axovant, which presented minutes earler, showed a slide (see: http://imgur.com/a/dqo3z) where their candidate RVT-101 plus donepezil together improved their patients' scores by an average +1.72 to +2 points on this scale across time... *compared to donepezil alone, __not their baseline__*. If you look at their actual slide, you'll see that while it seems consistently better than donepezil (albeit only at the high dose), their patients are still steadily *declining relative to baseline*, with only the high dose @ week 12 showing any kind of positive improvement at all (of just ~+0.25), dropping steadily thereafter to minus range at the very next time point and onwards.

While there is no guarantee that any beneficial effects of A2-73, if they are in fact even real, would continue to hold up over the course of a year, or even past 12 weeks, where RVT-101+donepezil did not, this to me very promising. Keep in mind Anavex's baseline for this is the start of Part B, so it's really already a measurement at 17 weeks from starting therapy, not 12, and any benefit from the on-off-on initial Part A treatment would actually have raised this baseline compared to the actual week 1 start. This is definitely something to keep an eye on when final Part B is released with the data for all 32 subjects over an entire year. Not to mention, in later trials, A2-73+donepezil may prove to have better results than A2-73 alone.

P300 data seems strong, it's pretty cut and dry, amplitudes become extremely close to those of healthy individuals. Though there are still lots of people who do not like this metric for one reason or another.

All in all, the data recapitulates the promising results from the 7/22 interim report, but with data across several metrics showing that P300 is not the only benchmark that is *suggestive* of improvement. There's a lot of unwarranted brouhaha in response to some, but not all, of the results not being statistically significant. I believe this reflects the hype and failure to do DD or understand the study by lots of recent buyers, but again, with the smaller cohort, this was never what the trial was designed to capture. All that the secondary endpoints here are trying to do is see if the study holds enough promise to conduct further trials, not definitively prove the drug's effectiveness. With a larger study, these effects can be shown to be real with sufficient power, and that's precisely the recommendation going forward: an upcoming P2B and/or P3 to assess these cognitive measures directly.

**Long-term outlooks**

I cannot tell you with any certainty what will happen on Monday. It might go way up, or people might continue to misunderstand results or get scared by the shorts and bashers. Personally, I am in this for the long haul, and have previously posted a thread detailing some of the arguments in favor of this. Of course, as new developments come out, my outlook may change; however, based on the CTAD development, my opinion has not. 

A few potential catalysts in the upcoming year before final P2A data comes out:

* Mainstream media coverage in the coming weeks
* Announcement of new trials (epilepsy, Parkinson's, ALS)
* Patents
* Designation for fast track / breakthrough by FDA
* Partnerships
* (low chance) Acquisition

I would expect Missling to space these out so this stock may do nothing for long periods of time. Now that it has received hype on places like the dreaded StockTwits, it may be the target of coordinated manipulation for a long time. You should all assess your own plans and decide if the timeline, risks, and expected returns are in line with your investment goals. ",39

**My Opinion/Catalysts**

Current Situation:

I’ve been loosely following Verifone now for almost a year. This is the first time I’ve actually taken the time to do a DD on them. Over a year ago now, I bought ~30 share for my wife in her IRA based on the move the EVM chips in credit cards this year. This DD has opened my eyes to how much more they have to offer coming up soon. It seems they actually have a few different things in the works to pul them out of the mess they’ve been in for a few years now. They have cut back on a lot of the products that they were throwing money at that just didn’t make sense for the business by going from 13 products down to a core offering of 8 products this year. This has enabled them to cut the fat and see an 18% increase in EPS YoY for 2015 so far. They have also been able to cut their debt down by $30MM this quarter alone to get their net debt after accounting for cash on hand down to $572MM. While still not a good position be be in, they are showing that quarter after quarter they have been paying down their debt. They were also upgraded from a BB- to a BB credit rating this quarter.

They have also been taking measures to better their cash flow. For a few years now this has been a concern. This quarter they were abel to go from $27MM to $42MM from last quarter. They are achieving this by lowering the time frame it takes to clear payments through their systems. This will ensure they can maintain enough cash flow to pay their bills and still generate a profit. Cash flow is at a 3 year high as of this quarter which shows that the measures they are taking are working in a big way.

Forward looking:

Looking to next quarter they expect things to stay essentially the same except for the boost in pre-holiday sales. Next ER is Dec 14 so all holiday sales won’t fall into this ER.They should see a slight increase in revenue next quarter due to the service fees paid by the companies using their system to process payments. 

The (hopefully) big gains won’t be seen until after Q1 2016. Likely more like Q2-3. The shift to [EVM chipped credit cards](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/247485) started earlier in 2015. There is a deadline that has already passed that basically says if a merchant doesn’t have an EVM card reader, and the bank has issues an EVM card, the merchant is legally liable for any breach/fraud against the card. The deadline to swap your card readers was Oct 1, 2015. This was initially the only reason I bought this stock last year. While the adoption rate has been good, there are still a lot of places that haven’t made the move. North American revenues grew by 61% this year mainly due to the adoption of the new readers. They report that there are still 8MM card readers that need to be swapped out in NA alone. They expect this to be a 2 year process. I would expect it to pick up next year after the holidays are over and to tapper off in 2017. Out of those 8MM readers, 7MM are from medium to small sized businesses and 1MM are from the hospitality industry. This also doesn’t count the card readers at every gas pump that will need to be upgraded. They expect those to increase revenues by around $50MM. This also doesn’t count the 3 major contracts that stole from competition this year and any new greenfield locations they service.

On top of the EVM swap out that has already shown profits this year, they have a full line of products that hasn’t even been released yet. They saw in previous years, when they were struggling, that they needed to have a more integrated and scalable solution for customers of all sizes instead of multiple solutions for different needs. That solution is now ready and will be launched in Q1 2016. They have developed a solution for POS that allows you to scale from a simple card reader all the way up to an enterprise system that manages transactions from multiple stores. This will cover anything from a small “mom and pop shop” with a single card reader plugged into a cell phone, to a NFC reader for Apple Pay, to servicing Walmart for all transactions (not sure if Walmart is a customer, just an example). The best part is that this hasn’t even been priced into any of the financials. This is truly a catalyst for next year from what I can tell. All products in the new line have been certified for PCIDSS regulations already so they are ready to hit the ground running in 2016. 

Theres also an untapped market that they are moving into in 2016, China. They have been building a management and engineering team there this year and will be launching in 2016. I see that as unmeasurable potential right now. With Apple now selling the iPhone in China, many merchants will be looking to get NFC readers in their stores so iPhone users can use that function. Theres also a security issue there (as we all know) so they will want the EVM readers to protect customers. 

I can’t say for sure how far up the stock price will go. I don’t think at this point in my “trading career” I can even give an educated guess. All I will say is that I feel the stock will continue to move up in 2016 and possibly into 2017 if everything works out as they have it planned. ",18

15-11-08,DD: $APDNW,"ok first off, big thanks to everyone at /r/wsb with these posts lately and especially /u/pcx99 and /u/gabriel87120. i can fucking read bollinger bands. i actually have a clue what to look for. i feel i'm riding a bike with training wheels.  this is a big deal. bollinger is fun to say and now i have 1% of a clue as to what i’m talking about. this DD is aimed at newbie traders less than a month into actual trading (me). 

my trade: i entered APDNW on oct 30th at $1.42 after seeing APDN on the top gainers and being talked about on stocktwits. this was AWESOME DD!. i scalped while it was gaining, then, having little experience and not quite understanding strategies, i figured APDNW would continue to climb, so i entered again on nov 2nd at $2.45. this shit was supposed to hit the number i pulled out of my ass, at least i thought based on my stocktwits DD. now i’m at an average cost of $2.06 and i’m in panic mode. my sweet 70% gains are -7.64% now. after seeing your guys posts, i decided not to panic sell. i’m going to try to determine if salvaging my loss is a possibility by doing some actual DD. 

background: oct 29th, an [article](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3618566-applied-dna-90-plus-percent-downside-on-fraud-partners-opaque-u-k-shell-deal-and-paid-stock-promotion) was published that prompted a sudden drop on APDN. shortly after, everyone bought in expecting the price to climb back up after APDN responded to the attack. nov 2nd, they make an [announcement](http://www.adnas.com/sites/default/files/apdn.press_release.diagnostic.dna_.reagents.nov_.2.2015.pdf) that they’ve started shipping out DNA. i had no clue this was happening and assumed the gains were due to people buying back in after they sold the previous friday. so we’ve got an extremely over bought and oversold situation based on what i learned from /u/gabriel87120. so already, just to point this out, based on what i learned here, i calmed the fuck down before i sold in a panic, and now i know, based on my analysis of the bollinger bands, i can expect some volatility soon. 

[charts](http://imgur.com/43U6cKR)

since i’m using robinhood, i’m unable to do a trailing stop loss so i’ll manually set a stop loss at $1.50 and wait to can see what direction things go on monday. dafuq? wait and see? nah. time for some actual DD. 

DD: alright, APDN announced they’re shipping DNA, few care, however they’ve just been awarded a [DOD contract extension](http://www.adnas.com/sites/default/files/apdn.press_.release.renewal.dla_.contract.nov_.4.2015.pdf) which focuses on “maintenance and repair components already manufactured”. nothing groundbreaking. nothing surge worthy. however, on the same day, fucking [frankenstein](http://goldberglawpc.com/wp-content/themes/lawyeria-lite-child/images/founder.jpg) announced a lawsuit in regards to the claims. looking into this dude, these guys make announcements about class action lawsuits all the fucking time. i give them 1 fuck. fuck those guys.

alright, so right now the only things that could possibly go in my favor are a) the conference presentation on nov 12th, or b) the earnings report in dec. i cant find a single damn thing that indicates APDN is going to announce anything noteworthy or make a bunch money. probably just say they’re working with DOD for more contracts. alright, i need to determine support and resistance and figure out what my move is.  

[newbie tip](http://www.investopedia.com/university/electronictrading/trading3.asp)

[charts with support/resistance](http://imgur.com/eCraXRf)

so i THINK what i’m seeing here - is based on the s/r, this is consolidated and the momentum is moving upward (i think). based on my analysis, my only option right here is to get out the second i can salvage my investment and do what i just did BEFORE i invest in something again. 

[my lines](http://imgur.com/FS7aCnI)

my strategy: after researching, i’m going to set the stop on all my shares to $1.60 (bottom line), then i’m setting my limit on half my shares to $2.50 (middle line) and the other half at $2.90 for wishful thinking. my exits were determined by drawing out support lines based on the consolidation and momentum i'm seeing. i have full confidence based the support lines i’ve drawn that i wont have any issues exiting at $2.50 and getting some gainz and help get me back to my loot. i’ll analyze again after i see the trend and determine if i think i should sell the rest of the shares or if i can hit $2.90. 

dissect this, tell me i’m doing it wrong, do whatever you guys need to do to help me learn! one thing i’m having trouble understanding is why the charts show the consolidation going for so long? i dont really understand why, but my gut tells me the market maker is going to make a move on monday to sucker buyers in. someone please explain why my hunch based on limited understanding is right or wrong. i'm hungry.",26
15-11-08,AKAO DD For You Lazy Bastards. Now Give Me My Fucking Paperback and Rainbow Dick Coloring Book,"Archaeogen Inc has been on my watch-list for sometime and here is why. Before we get into anything else, lets look at the basics. I love the ten million float. Not super low but not high by any standard. 50% of this guy is owned by tutes. I like institutional ownership at this percentage for companies like this. It also has 28% insider ownership so these guys have plenty of incentive to see the company do well. I love insider holding as well. As of this writing, it was last traded at 5.72 and the lowest analyst price target is $8. It is near the 52 week low and it has already seen $11 this year, with a high analyst target of $29.

70 million cash on hand, 14 million in debt.....with a cash burn of 18 mil and some change. I like this ratio because these guys are not desperate to dilute it. They also have pretty decent revenues, enough to offset their cash burn. Now that they are interesting from the purely financial side, lets look at what they do.

Plazomocin is their flagship drug, currently in phase 3. It is being developed to fight anti-biotic resistant bacteria (Which there is a big need for in the opinion of the medical community, things like MRSA arent easy to kill with standard antibiotic treatment). A Phase 3 trial is never a certain thing and I usually don't make plays based on that, but these types of drugs are easier to prove efficacy. You can get as much bacteria as you want in a lab environment and just fuck with it until you kill it.

Difficulty of the drug passing here is low IMO. These guys have plenty of money for R&amp;D, they already make money and I think they got the flagship product in the bag. They also have other things in the pipeline, inhibitor class drugs, etc. I think I have already provided a pretty good overview here. I am personally focusing on the VIX only right now but I love bios and I think this is a great trade idea.

I have made a lot of money on shittier biotech stocks than this. I don't mind sharing DD but if any of you guys really want deeper knowledge on this, just read the fucking SEC filings. There is all kinds of goodies in there. I don't see a need to copy/paste it or give a commentary. They are pretty transparent.",25

Company makes some shit that goes in your sinuses, expands a balloon, the sinus pressure is relieved without any surgical measures. It's a big deal for people with chronic allergies, as there is no potential scarring in the sinuses, and thus no ill effects. There is a semi-competitor, but the competitor's product is far, far more expensive and requires a hospital. ENTL's product is done in the doctor's office. &gt;80% success rate &lt;5% complications. Good stuff.

The company is expanding rapidly, with a purchase of a new building that increases their office space &gt;30%. They have a lot of new sales reps and office workers to match within the past quarter. 

Jump to ER:
New developments, blah blah, its good.
11 new products.
Nails earnings.
Costs are larger than expected, misses EPS.
Stock price drops, because cost is too high.
Increasing consumer base (physician training exponentially increasing in number).

Revenue +27% - strong market adoption of products
Operating 16.9 million, increased from 10.8 million prior year (&gt;50%)
Costs were larger for increased research, development, and expansion.

growth from 73 reps to 81 reps in the quarter, add 15-20 reps per year up until 2017, then expect to level out (~100 sales reps)

Q4 is projected to be similar gross margin results as Q3.

My bet:
This stock is at a relatively strong price right now. Will likely recover to ~18-19 by February, at which it will drop again from the next ER. However, I see this stock reaching mid 20's by this time next year.

TL;DR... not much of a YOLO here. 

I've got shares around -35% loss, I'm going to sell if the stock hits 18-19 by the end of the year and move out to something a bit more exciting.

It produces integrated circuits (ICs) primarily based on third party designs, as well as provides design support and related technical services. The company also offers various customizable process technologies, including silicon- germanium bipolar complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), mixed-signal/CMOS, radio frequency CMOS, CMOS image sensor, integrated power management, and micro-electro-mechanical systems.

This is mainly an analog and RF chip manufacturing company.

It is trading below its enterprise value at the moment with a P/E of 5.12. Earnings are coming up on November 11th and the stock has already shown strong bullish movement.
Here's a [chart](http://imgur.com/JxOt0xD) showing supports and resistances 

**Entry and exit points**
The stock has been going to higher highs consistently since September. Also, closer to earnings date its momentum has picked up. Ideally, I would have entered 2-3 days ago around lower $13 levels before it jumped 6% but I believe it has a lot of juice left post earnings.



There are two ways to play this, either look for an entry around $13 before earnings which might be difficult or look at the Nov 20 16 calls which are $0.25 right now. Exit around $20 within 2-3 months which would be more than 40% gain or for short term play go for options which would have potential for higher returns.",18

15-11-08,How to obtain capital for executing a winning trading strategy?,"I'm not sure the best way to approach this issue so I am coming here for help.

I have been trading since I was 14, mostly unprofitable for the first 6 years until I began utilizing what I have learned to trade more effectively. I have attempted to stick to a trading strategy in two separate 6 month periods resulting in lots of success. The first was November 2013-June2014 I traded Apple options every friday earning 58% through 75 trades. The second was November 2014-May 2015 where I weekly traded SPY for a gain of 22% vs SPY rising 4% in that time period. 25 trades where made.

Because of my success trading during these two periods I decided to try and formulate a strategy that I can automate. After several months of trying to do this, I have come to the conclusion that I have a working strategy. I back tested the strategy by using Yahoo Finance historical prices going back to 1995. These 20 years show my strategy beating SPY by 6% per year, even more if you compound the gains.
I am trying to think of a way to utilize my trading strategy in a legal way. Ideally I want to pool money together from people, however the regulations surrounding this are quite restrictive. I have looked into establishing a Cayman Islands hedge fund, but it appears to cost in excess of 10,000. I have also looked into proprietary firms and have emailed some, but no luck there either. 

Does anybody have any advice on my next course of action? I would really appreciate any advice that you may have. Thank you.",8
15-11-07,"Boredom's An Intro To Options","As we all know, there's been a massive push to get some genuine information to traders on this board and improve everyone's skills as traders. If this has a positive impact on the community I will make a new thread each week, diving a little deeper into how options work each time.

***This next part is about me, skip down for info:***

I don't do DD, I never read balance sheets, and I rarely trade stocks. My latest being AVXL, which isn't going well. The most profitable way I've learned to trade revolves around the use of options, learning technical analysis, and playing upcoming catalyst (earnings primarily).

I'll start off this by saying I wholeheartedly recommend tastytrade for all information regarding options basics and advanced techniques. I watch them consistently and they improve my trading immensely. Lately the show seems to be getting off topic and there is more talking about life than I like though. The older videos on youtube are the best for information in my opinion.

***The real options stuff starts here:***

I'm not explaining what options are, if you don't know: [Link to call options](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp), [Link to put options](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp).

I'm going to start off by explaining why options are better (in my opinion) than stocks.

When buying a stock, eliminating all external factors, there is a 50/50 chance of a stock moving in the direction you want it to move. Either it goes up or it goes down. 50% probability of profiting (POP) on a trade.

Options allow us heighten our chances to say 70%, 80%, or even 90% probability of profiting (POP) on a trade. Of course, there is a catch to this. That catch is that if you lose, you generally lose more than you could have earned. This still leaves us with a higher chance of profit in the end if we have a sufficient amount of trades.

**An Example:**

Assuming from here on out, we all don't know shit and there is a 50/50 shot of the stock going up or down.

I buy and sell a stock (50% POP) and each time my cutoff is $100 net gain or net loss. Doing this over, say, 1,000 trades will leave you at or near break even territory. (The Math: 100(.5) +(.5)(-100) = 0)

On an options spread lets say I have a 70% chance to make $150 or 30% chance at losing $200. We leave with a net gain of $45 total over 1,000 trades (The Math: .7(150) + (.3)(-200) = 45).

This greater POP allows us to handle trades in a unique way for us to profit more consistently.

""But Boredom"" you say, ""I can remain profitable because I am good at guessing which way the market is going to go and have a higher probability than 50% of making a successful stock trade.""

If you have a higher chance at making a profitable trade on stock trades based on proper DD, information on a companies situation, etc. This only heightens the chance of a successful options trade and allows to have greater gains on less capital.

This is long, I'm tired of writing. Next time I feel like writing (the better response I get from the sooner) I'll get in to detail of my own options trades at the moment maybe even make a video so there isn't this fucking wall of text. I just wanted to make sure everyone was caught up on how options work and why I use them.",43

This stock has been extremely volatile recently and you should do your own DD, this should be the start of your research. I'd also like to excuse myself in advance for my English mistakes because I'm a French Canadian... So here we go!


**The Company:**


Canopy Growth Corporation is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. It was formerly known as Tweed. V.CGC is the first publicly traded medical marijuana company in Canada and the biggest player in medical marijuana in Canada. Tweed is a producer of medical marijuana based in Ontario, Canada and it sells products directly to their customers. Tweed has acquired Bedrocan in last September, a company in the same field that produces and also imports pharmaceutical-grade medicinal cannabis to sell to their customers. It also recently acquired MedCannAcess to give a better experience to customers and also to find new ones.

**Catalysts:**


* New Canada's Prime Minister since November 4, Justin Trudeau wants to legalize marijuana for recreational uses and tax it just like in Colorado and Washington.
* Quarterly earnings should be released in the end of November and if the trend continues they will be higher than last quarter.
* Tweed will soon begin to sell oils extracts.
* Canopy will be sponsoring the Cannabis Cup in Jamaica (November 12-15).
* We don't know how the acquisition of Bedrocan and MedCanAccess will affect their earnings.
* We have no idea if/when it'll be legalized.


In my opinion, this is a long hold. I'm open to any suggestions, complaints, questions... If I made a lot of English mistakes and you have time to kill, I'd love it if you could correct me! :D

* Two influenza vaccines in Phase I and Phase II. Backed by BARDA. 

* Ebola vaccine in phase I (A little late to the fucking ebola party). 

They were [hit hard](http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVAX) by the biotech sell off of October, but are coming back now.

Short term play: Earnings report on 11/09. I believe it's being released before market opens so it may be too late to play this one. 

Long term play: RSV vaccine will be approved which is their largest catalyst. 12-month price target of around $15/share. Currently trading at $8/share. 

Recommendation: Play earnings if you can, but with the tight timing of earnings announcement Monday morning that's not likely  feasible. 

HOLD for now but worth keeping in the back of your mind for RSV FDA approval. Bill Gates wouldn't touch this shit if it wasn't going to turn to gold.

I understand day trading is little more than a gamble for somebody without experience, but I'm hoping my background might give me a slight advantage.
I'm a computational scientist and specialist in bioinformatics. My entire job is computationally processing huge amounts of data that is confounded by noise, excess variables, etc., and determining meaningful trends. I think if I spent some time looking for particular trends, I could make better day trading choices than shooting in the dark.
However, I'm just rather clueless about the whole process. I started with what I know best, which is data, and so I've written some scripts that scrape free websites with stock quotes and have a prices for thousands of stocks that are updated every 10 seconds. I then wrote a bunch of smoothing and parsing scripts to look for stocks that I predict will start the day low and end somewhat higher.
So, I want to put some of these predictions to the test of the market. I only have maybe $300 in spending dough to burn on this project at the moment (I quit my job and went back to school for an advanced degree). I'm wondering if the overhead processing fees of whichever financial website I have to go through will preclude any chance of seeing a return on my $300.
Can somebody please explain to me, from an introductory standpoint, which financial website I should use for my trades, what kind of fees to expect, and just generally if I am making a stupid choice? I'm not afraid of losing the $300, but I don't want to flush it away either. If I make good predictions I want my return to outweigh the processing fees.",0

15-11-07,Merrimack Pharmaceuticals ($MACK). Q3 and Q4 Earnings Play.,"Merrimack Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ - MACK) has been bought up here a few times. Its a pharmaceutical company that focuses on cancer, with their first drug having received FDA approval late October. The company is set to release its Q3 earnings Monday at 4PM, and based on what I've read, I think it can beat expectations in this earnings release, as well as the Q4 earnings release in a few months. This may be a little long, but I'll explain my reasoning below. 

***

&amp;nbsp;

^**Top** ^**Drug** ^**in** ^**Pipeline**

The company’s major drug Onivyde (MM-398) has received FDA approval as of Oct. 22nd 2015 to treat pancreatic cancer in combination with two other drugs. It is currently in Phase II trials for the same drug as a front-line treatment option (however that study is estimated to complete February 2017). MACK is responsible for commercializing this drug in the US. 

It has a few other drugs in different FDA Phases, but those aren't too important right now. 

***

&amp;nbsp;

^**License** ^**Agreements**

The company has a few licensing agreements for their drugs. I'm only going to talk about the ones that are relevant to Onivyde (MM-398). 

**Baxalta**

MACK agreed to a licensing agreement with Baxter Inc. in 2014 to develop and commercialize Onivyde (MM-398) outside of the US and Taiwan. Baxter then separated its Baxalta business, which means the agreement is now with Baxalta. Baxalta is in charge for getting regulatory approvals of the drug outside of the US and Taiwan, as well as mainly selling the drug outside of the US. However, MACK is in charge of conducting all trials and any other material needed for approval outside of the US and Taiwan. 

There are a few terms to this agreement:

1. MACK must receive $100M upfront (non-refundable) from Baxalta. MACK received this in September 2014. 

2. MACK must receive another $100M upon the achievement of certain development milestones. **$62.5M of these are estimated to be received in the second half of 2015** (i.e. Q3 and Q4). 

3. MACK must receive up to $520M upon achieving regulatory milestones. The company has received only $20M to date. 

4. MACK must receive $250M upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. 

5. MACK must pay the first $98.8M of costs related to developing Onivyde (MM-398) for front-line treatment. It expects most of these costs to be offset by the milestones that will be achieved in the same time. 

**PharmaEngine**

PharmaEngine had the rights to MM-398 in Europe and certain places in Asia. In 2011, MACK reacquired those rights for fees and royalties. After reacquiring these rights, I'm fairly sure MACK licensed most (or all) of those rights to Baxalta. However, reacquiring those rights from PharmaEngine cost fees. The good thing is that the fees it cost to reacquire those rights are less than the fees MACK receives from Baxalta. 

There are few terms to this agreement: 

1. MACK must pay $10M upfront to PharmaEngine. MACK paid this in 2011. 

2. MACK must pay up to $80M more in development and regulatory milestones. From what I can gather from the SEC Filings, it seems the company has paid about $16M of these fees so far. 

3. MACK must pay up to $130M in sales milestones to PharmaEngine. 

***

&amp;nbsp;

^**Importance**

You can see that the sales, regulatory, and development milestones fees that MACK has to pay to PharmaEngine are much lower than the sales, regulatory, and development fees it will receive from Baxalta. We do not know exactly what ALL of these milestones are that trigger the payments, but since it is for the same drug, its possible that the milestones are very similar. This is just an assumption on my part, but most likely when a milestone occurs that results in MACK paying fees to PharmaEngine, there's a good chance it is receiving revenue from Baxalta that offsets the fees paid (or is even higher than the fees paid). 

***

&amp;nbsp;

^**Proportional** ^**Revenue**

Now, currently, MACK operates at a loss every quarter. 2015 Q2 Revenues were $36.5M, and EPS was -$0.21. Which is why some of these milestones are so important, because triggering them can cause a significant increase in revenue. One thing to note is that the initial $100M paid by Baxalta (mentioned above) was not recognized in revenue right away. The company uses a proportional model of revenue recognition for that payment, meaning that it recognizes that $100M partially per period. For example, in 2015 Q2 it recognized about $16M of that revenue, and in 2015 Q1 it recognized about $15M. The rest of that revenue is in the Deferred Revenues account of its balance sheet. The company expects $59.2M of those deferred revenues to be recognized within the next 12 months. 

***

&amp;nbsp;

^**Milestone** ^**Revenue**

As far as milestones go, the company does not recognize them on a proportional basis. As soon as a milestone occurs, that revenue is recognized with none of it being deferred. This is important because in the latest 10-Q of the company: 

&gt; The $51.5 million of anticipated net milestones includes a one-time $15.0 million research and development milestone payment owed from Baxalta to us 45 days following the submission to the FDA of the protocol for a clinical study of MM-398 in front-line pancreatic cancer, during which period there is no notification of a clinical hold from the FDA. This submission to the FDA occurred on June 30, 2015. Also included in the $51.5 million is a $47.5 million research and development milestone payment owed from Baxalta to us if a patient is dosed in a clinical trial of MM-398 in front-line pancreatic cancer. We expect both of these milestones to be met in the second half of 2015. These milestone payments are offset by an $11.0 million milestone payment owed to PharmaEngine related to the EMA’s acceptance for review of an MAA for MM-398. This acceptance was received during the second quarter of 2015, and this payment was made in July 2015.

This is essentially saying that MACK receives a total of $62.5M from Baxalta for reaching developmental milestones (which I bolded in the License section of this post above), but a net of $51.5M because it owes PharmaEngine. It must pay $11M to PharmaEngine, since MACK sent an Marketing Authorization Application to the EMA (essentially the same as getting FDA approval but for Europe). This payment was made in July, but because the milestone occurred in Q2, this expense is already included in the Q2 results. Therefore, it has no impact for us in the future. 

So, we have a total of $62.5M in revenues that will be received by MACK in 2015. $15M of this is due to an FDA submission that occurred on June 30th 2015, but must not have a clinical hold for 45 days. Therefore, this milestone was completed in Q3, which means we're guaranteed $15M in revenues for this quarter, not including the proportional revenue that MACK adds in. 

The other $47.5M is received if a patient is dosed in a clinical trial of MM-398 for a front-line study. This milestone was achieved October 27th, 2015, given by a [press release](http://investors.merrimack.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=938604) by the company. That means this will show up in the Q4 earnings of the company, and $47.5M alone not even counting the proportional revenue is already the highest revenues the company will ever have. 

***

&amp;nbsp;

^**Analyst** ^**Estimates**

According to Zacks, the consensus EPS [estimate](http://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/MACK/detailed-estimates) for 2015 Q2 was -$0.28. MACK's actual EPS in the same time period was -$0.21. For 2015 Q3, the EPS estimate is -$0.41. Sometimes beating estimates can cause a stock to increase, not always, but usually its a good sign. 

With MACK, looking at just the major revenues and expenses in 2015 Q2:

Item | Amount
---|---
Revenues | $36.5M
R&amp;D Expenses | ($42.8M)
General Expenses | ($12.3M)
Interest Expenses | ($4.5M)

For R&amp;D expenses, it includes a one time $11M payment to PharmaEngine for the MAA milestone outlined above. So there's a good chance R&amp;D expenses decrease for Q3 since this was a one-time increase. For Revenues, $20M of them are a one time payment from Baxalta for the same milestone of submitting an MAA. This is why I said above there's a very good chance that anytime MACK has to pay PharmaEngine for a milestone, Baxalta probably has to pay more to MACK. So, even if there are more milestones and an increase in expenses, its probable that the revenues MACK receives from those milestones will more than offset it. 

Now, of the $36.5M in revenues, $20M was a one time milestone payment and the other $16.5M was from the proportional revenue model that MACK uses. We do not know how much of that proportional revenue MACK will recognize in Q3 and Q4, and we know that we will be missing $20M. However, we know that $15M is at least recognized in 2015 because of the FDA submission milestone. Plus, we know there will be at least some proportional revenue that is added on. We do not know how much, but as I mentioned above the company said $59.2M of the proportional revenue will be recognized within the next 12 months (on their Q2 Filing). This means on average the amount of revenue recognized should be about $15M per quarter for the next 12 months (2015 Q3, Q4; 2016 Q1, Q2). 

Q3 results will most likely not be earth shattering. However, I think the low consensus analyst estimates can cause it to beat earnings results in Q3. The company's 2015 Q2 EPS was -$0.21, and it doesn't seem that will fluctuate too much in Q3. However, the EPS estimate for Q3 is -$0.41. 

Beating expectations can cause the share price to increase, but obviously there's no guarantees. I feel that even if Q3 earnings don't cause a huge shakeup, Q4 earnings and the annual report will. As I said above, $47.5M in milestone revenues will be recognized in Q4, making that payment already higher than any quarterly revenue the company has reported. That's not even counting the proportional revenue that'll be included in the figure (probably $15M). One thing to keep in mind is that the current estimate for Q4 is -$0.13, which is much higher than -$0.41 and $0.21. I believe the company can beat that estimate based on what I've read and due to the increase in revenues. If Onivyde starts getting prescribed in these last two months before the quarter is over then we may see an even bigger increase in revenues. At this point though I'm not sure how long until actual sales from the US start coming in. 

***

&amp;nbsp;

^**Overall**

There are a few pros and cons to this stock. I think by its increase in revenues within the next 2 earnings reports, there is a good chance the stock's price increases. However, one thing to keep in mind is the fact that the company has never had positive net income, and yet its market cap is already at $1.1B. This means the chance of a huge increase in share price due to good earnings result might be limited. Even when the company received FDA approval for its drug in late October, the price didn't exactly shoot up. If you do buy, make sure to keep these things in mind.

&amp;nbsp;

^**Edit** ^**After** ^**the** ^**Q3** ^**Earnings** ^**Report:**

**I just want to comment for anyone that may come on this thread in the future (through the search function or any other way).**

**The $47.5M of revenues I mentioned above will not be all included in in their Q4 earnings. Based on the 10-Q for 2015 Q3:**

&gt;In October 2015, the Company achieved a $47.5 million milestone related to the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial of MM-398 in front-line pancreatic cancer. This milestone is a non-substantive milestone and revenue related to the achievement of this milestone will be recognized through the proportional performance model.

**Looks like they'll be recognizing it gradually every quarter. So, beating analyst expectations in Q4 by a lot and possibly seeing an increase in share price most likely won't happen. They previously said that milestone revenue was accounted for right away, but it turns out they only do that for 'substantive' milestones. They don't say what classifies as a substantive milestone. For example, submitting an MAA to the EMA counts as a substantive milestone (meaning $20M recorded right away). However, getting a patient enrolled in a Phase II trial does not count as substantive (hence the $47.5M being gradually recognized in revenue).
I was kind of banking on them recognizing $47.5M right away and surprising everyone. Looks like that wont happen!**",29
15-11-08,DD: Valero Energy Corporation (VLO),"Listen up faggots, I'm in the middle of a 24-hour hackathon and I've had 2.5 Redbulls of caffeinated cereal I got from a bank. What does this mean? IT MEANS I'M FUCKING AWAKE. So listen up and let me tell you about one of my best investments over the past year. I'm up 21% after I first bought them in May.

Note: VLO is *not* a YOLO. But it *is* a good stock.

Valero is an energy company that deals in transportation fuels and other gas products. They own 15 refineries (cap. 2.9 million barrels/day), 11 ethanol plants (cap. 1.3B gallons a year) and a 50-megawatt wind farm. 

They have the capability to produce various gasoline fuels, diesel fuel, low-sulfur and ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel, CARB diesel fuel, other distillates, jet fuel (no steel beams), asphalt, petrochemicals, lubricants, and other refined products. Recent low oil prices have been *great* for them.

They have a good amount of infrastructure set up already, reasonable debt (7.35B) and a decent amount of cash on hand (5.76B). They have a market cap of 34.6B. Their fundamentals are what originally attracted me to the stock, but their strong performance is what's kept me around, even as oil prices fluctuate. What fundamentals you say? Well their P/E value is only 7.57 which (to me) suggests that they're undervalued. They are also 82% institutionally owned which suggests extreme investor confidence.

Their past quarterly reports saw earnings up but revenue down. 

Take analyst ratings as you will, many people consider them complete bullshit. This is the only one I really pay attention to:

* Morningstar Economic Moat: Narrow. Their economic moat isn't too concerning to me as pretty much any oil company is going to have a narrow economic moat. Like any other oil company, they are affected by oil politics. Their ethanol plants and their investments into wind power give them a competitive edge in regards to diversifying however.

The remaining analyst reports via Schwab:

* Schwab Equity Rating - ""A"". They're the only thing in my portfolio with an ""A"" rating but they're only my 3rd best performing stock. That can tell you quite a bit about how reliable ratings are.
* Morningstar Equity Research - 3 star
* Credit Suisse Research: Outperform. Ignore if you want.
* Ned Navis Research: Buy. Ignore if you want.
* Argus 12 Month Rating: Hold. Ignore if you want.
* S&amp;P Capital IQ's Opinion: 5 star.
* Reuters Research Average Rating: Outperform.
* Market Edge Second Opinion® Weekly: Long

There are a few upcoming events to take note of:

* November 19th is their dividend ex-date. Quarterly dividend is $.50 and they have an annual dividend return of 2.22%. I don't have enough shares to get a meaningful dividend, but you might.
* January 27th (est.) is their Q4 Earnings. Analysts are expecting fewer earnings than last quarter. This means things.

I certainly plan on holding VLO for the long run. It's currently near its 52-week high, I wouldn't buy it here if you're expecting a YOLO, but if you're looking for a long, use your due diligence. Have fun faggots, I've got to get back to hacking.",19

Second Q rev. growth: 59%YOY

$APPF a cloud-based IT SaaS making most of its profits from residential services (i.e., renters can pay their rent to their landlord online through APPF provided app and website). Note that residential activity has been increasing for the past year and cloud-computing is itself a [fast growing sector.] (http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/01/24/roundup-of-cloud-computing-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2015/) All of these factors provide a very friendly terrain for the stock.

They are currently trying to diversify somewhat by moving into providing cloud services to law firms (81% customer increase Y/Y) as of the last ER. They are also known to charge pretty high prices. A question was asked during last CC about competition and the presenter was unphased, saying it exists, but ""From a competitive perspective in our segment, we're working with customers that are usually replacing a number of point solutions and looking for their first professional software purchase.” BUT, Reviews.com disagrees, stating:

&gt; High minimum monthly fee: AppFolio follows a common industry pricing model of $1.00 per unit per month, but they require a comparatively high monthly minimum fee of $200. The software is well designed and could be quickly learned by those with minimal experience and utilized by property managers with diverse portfolio sizes. However, if you're currently managing a smaller portfolio and don't expect much future growth, comparable products can be found that offer much lower minimum monthly fees. 

My interpretation of this and the last CC is that APPF fully recognizes that it has nothing particularly proprietary, so it is fully reliant on first-mover advantage. It is trying to saturate the most profitable segments of lucrative sectors and then quickly moving to the next sector and repeat. They are trying to grow revenue as fast as possible.  3 weeks ago they exercised an option in their lease to increase their office space: [8-K.] (http://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC/Document.Service?id=P3VybD1hSFIwY0RvdkwyRndhUzUwWlc1cmQybDZZWEprTG1OdmJTOWtiM2R1Ykc5aFpDNXdhSEEvWVdOMGFXOXVQVkJFUmlacGNHRm5aVDB4TURVeU5URTJNaVp6ZFdKemFXUTlOVGM9JnR5cGU9MiZmbj1BcHBGb2xpb0luY184S18yMDE1MTAxNC5wZGY=)

&gt; Pursuant to the Lease Amendment, the Company has exercised a portion of its expansion right under the Lease and, in doing so, has agreed to lease an additional 7,855 square feet of office space within the same building, which is separate from but adjacent to its corporate headquarters in Santa Barbara, California. As a result, the Lease now covers an aggregate of approximately 26,490 square feet of office space.

I take this to mean that they are growing fast as fuck expected. This a knowledge-intensive sector with very high margins of revenue per unit of labor.  A ~30% increase in office space will yield much more than a 1-for-1 multiple in their output capacity. 

*If you are new to this, you should note that a key difference between TA and fundamentals is that in the former you are only observing the stock, whereas in the latter you are just as interested in the environment the company operates in. Here we are just as curious about the sandbox as the company itself.* 

Now let’s take a look at the [10-Q.] (http://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC/Document.Service?id=P3VybD1hSFIwY0RvdkwyRndhUzUwWlc1cmQybDZZWEprTG1OdmJTOWtiM2R1Ykc5aFpDNXdhSEEvWVdOMGFXOXVQVkJFUmlacGNHRm5aVDB4TURReU1URXdPQ1p6ZFdKemFXUTlOVGM9JnR5cGU9MiZmbj1BcHBGb2xpb0luY18xMFFfMjAxNTA4MDYucGRm). Specifically, we want to know what happens when the lock-up expires on *December 23*.

Here is where it gets shady folks. On pg. 20, the table shows that in the 6 months ended June 30, just **345 shares** were awarded as part of the standard stock compensation scheme. And overall, just a few thousand shares are owned by insiders. This seems odd, since FinViz shows 12.3% insider ownership.

So, back to the 10-Q, on page 44 we find this little gem: 
&gt; ""We are an emerging growth company and our decision to comply with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements could make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors. We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting requirements and may be relieved of other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. These provisions include:
an exemption from compliance with the auditor attestation requirement on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;

&gt; an exemption from compliance with any requirement that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board may adopt regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;

&gt; **reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements**; and

&gt; **exemptions from the requirements to obtain a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute arrangements**.

&gt; We have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. However, we intend to take advantage of the other exemptions discussed above. Accordingly, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different from the information you receive from other public companies in which you have invested.

&gt; We cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock, the market price of our Class A common stock may be more volatile, and the trading price of our Class A common stock may be lower than that of comparable companies."" 

And then on page 48:
&gt; Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities Since April 1, 2015, **we have sold the following securities that were not registered under the Securities Act (the information below reflects the impact of a one-for-four reverse split of our common stock effected June 4, 2015** and the conversion and reclassification of all outstanding shares of our common stock into shares of our Class B common stock in connection with our initial public offering):
▪  We granted to our directors, officers, employees and other service providers, under our 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, options to purchase an aggregate of 81,519 shares of our Class A common stock at an exercise price of $12.00.
▪  We issued and sold to our officers, employees and other service providers, under our 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, an aggregate of 245,185 shares of our Class B common stock upon the exercise of options at exercise prices ranging from $0.14 to $5.64, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $458,743.
▪  We issued to certain of our directors, under our 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, an aggregate of 24,999 shares of our Class A common stock. 

~~~~~~~~

Conclusion: 1) I fully expect APPF to murder its ER; 2) I have no intention of keeping a large position past December 23 lock-up expiration. 

Looking forward, I want to see what happens with insider selling. I am also curious about the 33.5M outstanding shares, a ridiculously high amount compared to the float. After employees cash out I would not be surprised to see some of those shares used in stock-for-stock acquisitions. Even though I love the prospects of the company, I will not buy again for at least a year. 

Basically, I don't trust management and need more of a track record. The presenter at the last CC fudged the truth about the competitiveness of the company's target market and the obfuscation regarding the share compensation makes me suspicious. (*Note again to new folks, whether you trust management is one of the most critical questions you are looking to answer in DD of fundamentals.*)

EDIT: One more tip for newbies of ER plays, this is not like a biotech trial results announcement or conference, where investors have pre-calculated valuation models based upon certain metrics. It is also sub-1B mkt cap and cash-flow negative, which means it is more complex to valuate, not a priority for analysts, and has less coverage in general. So revaluations based upon ER results will not be immediate, and could take several days. ",15

15-11-08,DD: $X,"US Steel (X) – DD
Overview:  The Materials Sector has been hit hard in recent months.  Lower demand, a strong US Dollar, cheap imports, and rising costs of labor have caused many material companies to hemorrhage money.  US Steel is no exception.  This bearish trend is likely to continue.

Company Review:  US Steel is a producer of value added metals and construction materials. Its primary input is iron ore, purchased from mining companies on long term contracts.  Through smelting, the company produces raw iron, which they then transform into a variety of products, including sheet metal, extruded pipes, and construction materials.  These goods are sold largely to car manufactures, oil companies, and construction companies here and abroad.

Company Financials: Earnings are lower than this time last year, Debt appears to be increasing, major closings and sale of facilities, Cost of Goods Sold has increased due to increased labor costs and lingering long term supply contracts.  Overall the company is in a poor financial position and may file for bankruptcy in the next year.

Stock Review: As of Friday the stock price was 10.90 per share, in the last month the price have been trading in a channel between 10 and 13 dollars, increases in the stock price correlate strongly with the price of oil.  I believe this is largely because one of the major consumers of US Steel’s products is the oil production industry.  Since oil prices are low new development is low.

Plays: Short Selling (upward resistance at and around 13), Put Options, Sell Call options, Short term long (resistance at 10, short term because of risk of bankruptcy)

15-11-08,My and your thoughts on oil?,"Hey guise just thought I'd share my basic analysis on oil. Would love to hear what you guys think. Just want to make sure I'm not too off the mark; want to make sure I'm not echo chambering myself. 

Anyway on where the oil price may go: Chinese demand will be lessened due to the slowed growth rate coming out of China at under 7%. Additionally, with the recent announcement of the Five Year Plan aiming for around 6.5% GDP growth (the actual growth rate may even be lower), I think demand may stay weaken further. 

However, other developing and emerging economies may increase demand as their economies grow; alternative energy sources are not as viable as oil, natural gas, etc. at the moment, and likely for the near future. 

The supply issue is another thing to think about, as many analysts believe there is a oversupply of oil and this may be hampering the commodity’s ability to rise in price (however there also seems to be some opposition to this view? There's not an oversupply? or it's overblown?). Natural gas is another strong contender as it continues to be a cheap alternative in meeting certain energy needs (so not completely replacing oil but taking up oil market share in certain areas like home heating, etc). 

(prediction:) But overall steadying at best, and a lower price at under $50-60 for the next few years.",2

15-11-08,Automation and Industries,"I foresee a very interesting future coming out of technology, automation, warehousing, and automotive that could cause a massive shakeup in several markets including e-commerce, housing/property/land, banking, and brick and mortar.  Very simply put: population shift from suburbs to major cities, ride shares, alternative energy, and essentially entropy at the human level.  With slowing global economies, companies will be a race to the middle class for a gain in market share...  

As a newer investor, I'm curious to see how those experienced account for the future trends that will impact these major sectors?  The automotive alone will not only change for consumers (ie ride share or individual), but will also change drastically for business.  If the thought is that Apple or Google will be able to create the automated vehicle, who's to say that's the limit?  Controlling transportation of shipping channels doesn't seem out of reach if its cost effective... 

Hoping someone can shed some direction (that doesn't invest like buffett) on the top things that I should be looking for taking future trends into play for stock investment?  What are the top things you look for in these companies?  Are there any friction points that you're seeing that defer you away?",7

15-11-08,Intro to Futures,"With all these DD posts my dick has doubled in size(possibly quadrupled).  

Anyway let's do a intro to futures.  Most of you already trade an underlying that technically is a derivative of a future.  UWTI/DWTI are related to crude oil.  UGAZ/DGAZ are related to Nat Gas.  NUGT/DUST are related to gold miners(or diggers) who are related to gold price.  And the big daddy of liquidity ES(E-mini S&amp;P) related to S&amp;P.  Why don't you fags trade futures instead?  


Let's start with the advantages

**Leverage.**     
You only need 5k and you can trade 1 contract of something.  Let's take the E-mini S&amp;P(ES), with 5k you're trading 100k worth of stuff.  So with the same result that you would get by buying 100K worth of SPY stocks you would by buying just 1 contract of ES.  1 mini S&amp;P = 500 SPY shares.  Do the math yourselves if you don't believe me.

**23-5 Trading hours**.       
Oh that's right futures are open 23 hours a day 5 days a week.  Worried about AVXL crashing the market?  You can offload your futures Sunday night before the open on Monday.  Good earning report on AMZN, GOOG and AAPL?  Buy some NQ(Nasqad mini futures).


**Taxes.**   
Weather you hold for half a second or the month(Remember you gotta roll over to next month) you will always get taxed under the 60-40 rule.  60% of your profit from futures will be taxed as a long term gain, 40% will be taxed as short term gain.

**Longing/Shorting.**   
You can buy or sell as you wish, no need to borrow stock or pay interest to your broker.  Long and short like you were going OCD on the body of Megan Fox.

**Options.**    
Damn right you could option on these motherfuckers and the premiums are better than NFLX on steroids.

There's no disadvantage other than you could ~~lose~~ YOLO your money.  But that's the way of the YOLO.  Obviously better than being Vanguarded to life support.  And you can always roll the contract to the next quarter or month.

The only thing you need to remember is the tick size, the more tickles to your dick the better for you.  The more tickles down your ass the more bad for you.  Unless you're shorting than it's the opposite.

EDIT:  Almost forgot:  You don't need 25k in your account.  You can buy and sell 1000 contracts a day if you want.

EDIT2:  thank you for the NUGT, stranger.  I'm long DUST though till Yellen decides(actually I hold no position on gold).",17

15-11-08,SBUX long term play.,"Ok, I don't have very much to say about this but I think Starbucks could potentially double your money within the next few years. 

First, lets start off by looking their business model. Sell an addictive substance and mark it up 5000%, and people are lined up all day everyday waiting to buy a cup.

Second, GROWTH. Would you just look at their growth. The stock is up almost 60% in the past year alone.  Just last quarter their revenue was up 18%, and their company sales up 8-9%. Tell me another company thats worth almost $100B and still growing with those kinds of numbers. I can easily see this going up quite, (just pulling out a random number here but I'd say $100+ stock price), a bit if they continue their growth, which doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. It seems to be having a little bit of a pull back at the moment, which is normal since it has such a good run lately, to which I will just buy more.

Third, CHINA. With new stores opening everyday and they are going to start focusing more on food items and start selling alcoholic drinks, I see lots of growth and lots of money to be made within the next 1-2+ years. The CEO said ""starbucks is opening a new store a day in china."" Since they are just kind of getting started in china, once they get pretty big over there I think thats when it will take off. 

TL;DR, Starbucks seems to be growing with fantastic numbers, and over the next few years I believe an investment right now would pay off. This was probably a crap post with not much information but whatever idc... Its fucking starbucks not much else to be said honestly... lol Do what you want but I'm going long on SBUX.

Diversify your portfolio, don't chase profits/catch falling knives, etc. I'm here to teach you the finer things in life that go beyond simplified platitudes. 

Before proceeding, keep in mind that you are only as good of an investor as your emotions will allow. If you can't rationally enter and exit a position without inviting greed, you will eventually burn. These rules will allow you to separate logic from emotions so, hopefully, you make less mistakes. 

---

**PROFIT EXPECTATIONS:**

By this I don't mean ""100%+ or nothing"". When creating a portfolio of major pieces, take each piece and outline these points *before doing anything*.

1\. If this is a temporary investment, what is the latest you're willing to hold? What is the earliest you can get rid of it? 

2\. In this time frame, how much do you expect to (realistically) profit? How much do you expect to lose?

To elaborate on #2, assume you have an FDA approval catalyst coming up for drug company WSB. If approved, what do you think the share price will go up to? If denied, what will it go down to? Use these as hard markers for the next point.

3\. Set a soft price target (profit) that you will use to unload a portion of your investment if said target is met. A soft target is optional, but what it does is it lets you exit a position in parts and still wait for a major catalyst. Realistically this should be around 5% for more stable companies, and 10+% for companies with more upside. 

5% profit on a short term investment is nothing to scoff at. Over the course of a year, these small 5% gains will net you more profit than any index. It's when greed takes over and you decide to hold out for just a *little more*. Then you realize smarter investors have already dumped for their 5+%. Now you're at a loss and fucked. 

4\. Set a **hard** price target (profit). You will sell at this price target *no matter what*. You're in this company to make money; not hold out hoping they go up for the next 2 months and make you rich.

At the end of the day you're here to make money. You're holding something that just went up 10% in a day, which is your hard price target. You think, holy shit, what if it goes up another 10% tomorrow? What if they release an FDA approval and it goes up even more? I'll be rich!

No. Fuck that. At the end of the day you're just a dumbass hoping for the next big cure in clinical retardation so you can finally be normal. You don't have .05 ping at an office 20 feet away from the NYSE. You don't have a room full of computers that spend more on air conditioning than you will on college. Take your 10% and run. Invest in something else that will give you another 5-10%. Keep repeating that and you'll be up far more than if you had kept chasing profits hoping for another 10%.

---

**LOSS EXPECTATIONS AND HEDGING:**

5\. In tune with above, you will now set loss targets. Both soft and hard. 

6\. Instead of dumping your shares at these price points --which you definitely can if you're a pussy (but really though there's nothing wrong with cutting losses while you can) -- you hedge with short positions. 

Let's say for drug company WSB noted before, you expect a loss of 30% if FDA approval is negative. You can buy slightly OTM put options for 10% of the underlying stock's current price. These put options will expire 2 weeks after FDA decision date. If the underlying does indeed fall 30%, your put options will now have an intrinsic profit value equal to ~20% of the underlying. The insurance value, let's say 5%, is slightly less than 10% because the main catalyst has passed (aka volatility is lower than before).

Your initial investment of $1000 in WSB is down 30% because of the negative announcement. But you also spent $200 on put options, which bought you 10 put options worth 20 cents each (assume WSB is worth $2 per share). After dropping 30%, these puts are now ITM by 60 cents, which makes it so your $200 has went up to $600. 

Even though the FDA decision tanked WSB, you actually made a small profit. The negative in doing this is it reduces your potential profits. The $200 in put options would expire worthless if the FDA decision is positive. If you made 30% profit on your $1000, you technically only made 10% profit ($100) because you spent $200 on an insurance policy. 

---

**COMMON SENSE RISK ANALYSIS:**

What have we learned? 

For one, you can only consistently make money if you leave emotions out of the equation. The fear of missing out is a very real thing that every investor has felt. You sold a stock for 10% profit, but the next week it went up 200%. *If only I had held onto it a little bit longer*. But that 10% profit could have also turned into a 40% loss. The fear of missing out on these potential gains is what turns a smart investor into an addict. The moment you hold past your researched hard target, you've started gambling.

I also talked about the importance of hedging. When you play on a major catalyst, you have accepted the possibility of losing money as well. There is never a 100% guarantee that the FDA will approve a drug, or if a company will kill profit expectations. Insurance policies in the form of shorts and put options will reduce your profit margins. But when you play with luck, a 5% profit is better than a 5% loss.

Hopefully this advice spurs y'all to invest with a more level head for whatever you pick in the future. This is /r/wallstreetbets and of course we're all here to YOLO. Though when I YOLO I still expect to leave with a certain gain or loss, and these margins are always within reason.

15-11-08,YieldCo DD: Terraform Global (GLBL) - *NO CHARTS!*,"Not a technical or YOLO trade by any means as I consider myself more value focused, but here's some DD I did earlier this summer around the IPO which I think shows a trade with a lot of upside potential. 

&amp;nbsp;

*WHAT:* Terraform Global (NASDAQ:GLBL), the international yieldco for SunEdison (NYSE:SUNE), which is basically a REIT for energy companies. The YieldCo owns and operates energy generating assets (wind and solar farms in this case) which are contracted under long term (20+ years typically) agreements to deliver power at relatively fixed prices (typically indexed to inflation). Investors buy the YieldCo and it passes through most cash as dividends. SUNE uses the YieldCo to monetize or ""drop down"" the projects it's developing once they're completed and contracted.

&amp;nbsp;

*WHEN:* GLBL IPO'ed at $15 at the end of July, below the original price / size targets, and promptly dropped to the $14 range in trading. Just days later SUNE reported poor Q2 results - at least, relative to expectations - and GLBL promptly began a decline in share price till it was under $10 by the end of August - despite no news coming from GLBL itself. It's worth noting that GLBL had indicated an annual dividend of $1.10/sh in the IPO prospectus implying a yield of ~7.3% at the $15 IPO price. The $10 share price at the end of August suggests a yield of 11%, and **the latest share price of around $7.65 implies a staggering 14% yield.**

&amp;nbsp;

*WHY:* Generally the whole dip in the energy / power sector has been a bit hard for people to explain. SUNE is growing the business just like it said it would, the YieldCos are all operating like they were before (and are on fixed-price long term contracts to boot) and most research analysts have the YieldCo's tagged as a BUY with target share prices well above where they actually are (from memory, GLBL px targets are $9-15). I think low NG/oil energy prices have spooked a lot of energy investors and turned sentiment so that GLBL is now down 50%+. All this despite nothing changing about the business model! I've been regularly tracking company news since the IPO and I've seen nothing negative. All indications are that GLBL is still targeting a $1.10 annual dividend and still planning to grow that significantly. The average life of contracts is still 19-years and they're still hedging currency risk on a rolling 3-year basis. There'a also been decent insider buying post-IPO at prices well above the current share price:
* New CFO Alejandro Hernandez received options (performance based) on 10/09 (25k shares @ $0)

* CEO Carlos Domenech bought on 8/25 (15.6k shares @ $8.045/sh)

* Director Mark Lerdal bought on 8/21 (10k shares @ $9.42)

* Director Mark Lerdal bought on 8/14 (10k shares @ $10.659)

&amp;nbsp;

*MOTIVATING FACTORS:*

* Long term contracts on generating assets with a weighted average life of ~19 years

* Geographic Diversification with contracts in international currencies and FX risk is hedged 3 years out

* Prospectus and September ER confirm they're targeting $1.10/yr dividend and want to grow from there (growth might be challenging). CAFD to support $1.10/yr div is already in place.

* Cutting the dividend would be suicide since yield is already too high to make pretty much any equity-funded acquisitions accretive. Management needs to grow CAFD and get the share price up any way they can

* Insider buying I already mentioned

&amp;nbsp;

*RISKS:*

* Some FX risk due to international nature of revenue and USD dividends but it's hedged on a rolling 3-yr basis, so my horizon is 2-3 yrs

* Current price makes any new acquisitions with equity impossible. Dividend growth may be stunted but existing divs should be fine

* Has been a lot of reports of lawsuits lately because the price dropped do bad after the IPO. These seem to be mostly no-name law firms trying to drum up a class-action suit for misrepresentation so not sure how to evaluate it, but given the investment banks that ran the IPO know their shit, I find the odds of a big settlement unlikely.

* Generally, looks like Fed will raise rates in Dec :(

&amp;nbsp;

*INVESTMENT THESIS:*

* The way I see it, this is a business where the model is literally ""keep the lights on and get paid"" with 20-year contracts - not to mention geographical diversification by default. Although they haven't paid a dividend yet there shouldn't be any cash flow issues with 19yrs left on contracts and FX hedged till at least till 2018. 

* **I am long in the low $7 area with the intention to hold up to 2-3 years.** If the share price goes nowhere, I'll take my 14% yield. If it rebounds I may exit and look for something new

&amp;nbsp;

Very receptive to other thoughts and opinions. I get the feeling these kinds of picks aren't as exciting as AVXL but maybe you guys can put down the redbull and cocaine long enough to focus on a more traditional asset class. At the very least, maybe the mods can fix the damn formatting... *Italics* and **Bold** (that's supposed to be bold) are fucked up

15-11-08,DD: $RBY - Rubicon Minerals Corporation - Four Million Ounces of Yachtblocks,"$RBY - Rubicon Minerals Corporation
Rubicon Minerals Corporation is a Canadian gold exploration company based in Red Lake, Ontario. In the past year they have seen several setbacks on their newest mine which is expected to contain four million ounces of gold. The first setback was a fall of ground during the initial trail stoping phase, and later elevated levels of ammonia saw their stock plunge by 60% and CEO resign. They quietly replaced CEO Mike Lalonde with Michael Winship, P.Eng, who has chaired several other investment and mining companies (Orvana, CIM, Quadra FNX, Avanti)
Production can be put on hold up until Q2 2016, as the company has enough cash to burn especially since it has cut 87% of its workforce and contractors. Production will be able to begin again once the updated Phoenix Project Implementation Plan (""PPIP"") has been developed by April 2016. Rubicon have also stockpiled raw materials to ensure that they can also produce gold bars in the mean time.
&gt;Currently, the Company has a stockpile of approximately 11,000 tonnes of mineralized material at an estimated gold grade of approximately 4.0 g/t Au, which Rubicon expects to process in November;

&gt;Rubicon is carefully managing its working capital balance of C$23 million as of October 31, 2015 and believes this is sufficient to carry the Company through the PPIP period, which is expected to be completed in second quarter 2016; 

&gt;Since the start of commissioning in May 2015, Rubicon has produced 3,704 ounces of gold (and sold 2,498 ounces of gold)

This is not too shabby considering the closures they have had to endure, hopefully with a new CEO and an improved plan they can use their reserves to send this shit into the stratosphere combined with the help of some luck in the gold markets. The price of gold could be making a comeback by the time this mine is running again.
With production able to begin again within the next year, and rumours of a takeover, as well as an all time share low of $0.13, it's bound to draw other investment and start turning over yachts in no time, right guys?

History of AEO:

AEO's direction:
It appears that AEO wants to distance itself from the middle/high school crowd and start engaging with young adults and colleges. It appears that it is trying to follow the Generation Xers now that the demographic has gotten older. This means that the quality of their products will have to increase, which means their products will have to increase in price.

They have aspirations to take the Tailgate brand and place it in campus bookstores. They currently have contracts with the SEC and Big 10 conferences. These conferences have schools with some of the largest fan bases of college sports. They plan on getting to 200 schools. The vision is to incorporate each college's history into the clothing, so have clothing depicting important plays from school history, as well as incorporating the culture in the school town, like famous bars, and cultural festivals.

College sports also cater to markets that don't have professional sports teams in states like Iowa, Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, etc. This could be the first brand besides a sports wear company that could take advantage of college sports fandom.

My take:
It seems that the short term bump with the news of acquiring Todd Snyder has already taken effect. However, if more news begins to keep trickling out with the direction Todd wants to take AEO, there could be some great opportunities to make some money. I see this being a better long term value.

15-11-09,DD: Universal Display Corp (OLED),"Universal Display Corporation (ticker is OLED) is a R&amp;D company that researches Organic Light Emitting Diodes (OLED), a technology used for screen displays. It is also in collaboration with PPG to produce the chemicals. This is somewhere between a speculative company and a growth company.

**I'll be using the abbreviation OLED to mean the technology, not the company.** Note Universal Display isn't the only company making OLED.



**The Technology**

Many of you will know what OLED screens are, but here's a quick primer. OLED displays are a newer competitor to the commonplace LCDs. It has been around for many years so it's not exactly brand new. OLEDs have been used in many android phones for years, notably those from Samsung.
With OLED only the individual pixels needed are powered, this includes only the individual colour in the pixel. E.g. if a red pixel is needed, only the red layer for that one pixel is powered. This results in better colours, contrast, and lower power consumption. This is important for phones, tablets, and wearables. The organic part comes from the organic chemicals used.
In comparison, LCD pixels act as a coloured filter that either blocks or allows light to pass through from a backlight. This also means there is some unwanted light leaking through the pixels.
Glass is not required, so the screen will not break if the phone is dropped. Not sure why this isn't pushed more. All the hype is about the bendable/flexible displays, I think simple non-breakable is a great selling point. Plastic screens could scratch more, but most people use screen protectors. There could also be development of more scratch resistant surfaces to mitigate this.
Production can also include flexible displays, transparent displays. By their nature they are also thinner than LCDs.



**Market**

* Phones, tablets - They expect this area to grow slowly. I don't understand this reasoning because a big benefit is low power consumption. And burn-in (see risks) is not as big an issue for devices with typical replacement rates of 2-3 years. I see this as a big market.

* TVs - They expect this to become a large portion of their revenue over the coming years. I don't understand this reasoning, given the high cost (~$4k for a 55"" TV) and burn-in is a more of an issue given a TV is typically on for long, straight periods (burn-in results from heat generation). People typically don't replace their TVs as often, unless there is a substantial reason to. (Note that the LED TVs that you see in the store are LCD screens that use an LED backlight, they are not OLED screens). I see this as a small market until the costs come down. Although given their larger screen size even a modest number sold would take a lot of chemicals.

* Monitors - They've lumped this into Tablet in their projections. I think there could be some potential here although I don't see them on the market. Burn in would be an issue. Monitors are reasonable size so it wouldn't be prohibitively expensive to buy. OLED has faster response time so gamers would love it, and many would like the better colours.

* Wearable tech - There are many possibilities. The Apple iWatch uses OLED from LG Display. The uptake of these products is hard to figure out. However the displays are small so the volume of product used is small. E.g. it would take ~1000 watches to equal the area of a 50"" TV.

* Lighting - OLED panels can be used as light. Probably a small market for specialty needs. Normal LEDs can also be set up for diffuse lighting, potentially impacting this market. But there are interesting abilities with OLEDs since they are thinner, can be curved or transparent.

 * Other - OLED applications are versatile given the flexible, bendable, transparent nature. Could lead to some interesting things like TVs that roll up, HUD like displays that can be seen through. Somewhat gimmicky but there could be interesting uses that we don't see at this time. 



**Financials**

They make money from licensing fees and material sales. Universal Display holds the most number of patents in this area. Future income growth depends on OLED tech being adopted for phones, tablets, monitors, tvs and any other displays.
Revenues and profits are growing the last 5 years although 2015  an ok state now. In 2011 there was a 5.1% profit, 2012 11.6% profit, 2013 50.5% profit, 2014 21.9% profit, 2015 so far is looking like 0% 

66% of income comes from material sales, 33% comes from royalty and licence fees, materials/chemicals related to oled, 1% from technology development and support revenue.
Materials and chemicals are manufactured by PPG industries under Universal Displays direction and purchased by companies like Samsung. This is an interesting strategy for Universal Display, at 50% of their income it's a large source of income that had helped turn a profit and could grow significantly in the future. This manufacturing income helps buffer them from patent litigation/loss of patents/future patent competition from companies with larger R&amp;D budgets. However there are many companies that could manufacture and sell the products themselves if they wanted to, with appropriate license payments, which could put this income stream at risk. 
Cash of $109 million, short term investments of $247 million. No debt, accumulated deficit $99 million. Not bad, it can definitely withstand some bad quarters if it needed to.
I didn't do much financial analysis because most everything depends on increasing revenue from licensing and material sales, which depends on the tech being adopted more. Also the margins and price points depend on improved manufacturing processes that are under development. If you're looking at quarterly statements be aware that Samsung pays them all the licensing fee's twice a year in Q2 and Q4



**Customers**

Samsung is a big customer for both phones and TVs
Motorola - I believe is a customer, can't find specific information but Motorola has sold them some patents and has free use of those patents. Motorola could be paying to license other related patents.
Apple - The 800lb gorilla in the room does not use OLED for their phones. Apple has criticized OLED colours as too saturated, but I think this is a calibration issue and not inherent to the technology (Samsung like to saturate so their phones pop out more at the stores). If Apple does start using OLED we don't know who would benefit the most, Universal display, LG display, Samsung, or if they're doing their own R&amp;D. One article said Universal display is at the centre of the OLED patents so they would stand to profit regardless. I'm mainly relying on others articles for this.
Military – not much, just think it’s cool (and sweet DoD contracts)



**Licensing**

Some of the income goes to various University research facilities for their research and the Government for their funding.



**Risks**

OLED is a newer technology and growth depends on adoption of this technology. OLED is more expensive than LCD (I'd guess ~30 to 40% of android phones and some windows phones use oled, it is not an onerously high cost). LCD quality and prices are also improving. OLED is inherently better but adoption is dependant on the relative price and quality difference between the two.
LCD has no significant burn in issue (burn-in is where images burn into the screen, significant when a screen is paused for a long period or where there are consistent borders/menus/etc). OLED has some burn-in issues although there is research into this to address.
Two key patents are set to expire 2017 and 2019. This would take much more in depth analysis of all their patents and patent applications to figure out specific impacts.
There are patent disputes going on with their competitors, with competitors trying to invalidate Universal Displays patents. I could do more research in this area, but it could take months and I still wouldn't understand much of it. Some news articles suggest the payment disputes with LG Display are dieing down.
There are different variants in OLED technology that could move the market away from Universal Displays patents. Universal Display focuses on phosphorescent OLED, which is considered better and has better future potential than fluorescent OLEDs mainly used by LG display.



**Competitors**

LG Display Corp, Sumitomo, AU optronics and others.
LG Display Corp appears to be the next biggest player in OLED. Overall it's much bigger and has more resources that they could throw at R&amp;D, which they have said they are doing. Oddly enough, LG display is also a customer. It could also be a good investment.



**Summary**

OLED is a great technology and is promising. Company growth and stock gain depends on OLED adoption. I certainly believe this will happen over time. Be aware there is competition from existing LCD technology, other companies, patent litigation, and possibly other new technology. The financials look fine, no debt means they won't collapse if there's a few bad quarters. I believe there is significant potential upside as the technology is adopted. This adoption will be over years, not quarters. As with all tech it's a constantly changing field so you have to make sure you stay on top of it.

15-11-09,"DD: Kinder Morgan, Inc. ($KMI)","DD: Kinder Morgan, Inc. KMI

Looking for feedback on this, I know there's a lot of smarter people here than me, and a couple people who are familiar with the oil industry.

Kinder Morgan is a midstream oil company with 84,000 miles of pipeline in the U.S, and 165 terminating processing assets. It's the largest oil pipeline transporter in the U.S. and the third largest natural gas transporter. It is also known for its dividend, most recently paying out $0.51 for Q3 2015 and has had a historical dividend growth target of 10% a year. They have a current market cap of $58B and an annual income of $1.07B

KMI stock has dropped 18% in the past quarter and 35% for the year to $26.06 as of Friday. This is largely due to the drop in the price of oil and natural gas. Though the drop in oil hasn't necessarily affected KMI's revenue (oil pipeline operator contracts are based on volume transported indepedent of the price of the commodity), Kinder Morgan's natural gas operations outside of transportation (gathering and processing) have taken a hit.

In order to continue funding growth, in November 2014 Kinder Morgan consolidated its MLPs into the parent company. The idea was that the simplified structure would reduce the cost of capital and make it easier to issue shares under KMI to raise capital for projects. The problem is that since the price of oil/natural gas has dropped, so have KMI's shares, and financing for the company remains expensive. For instance, on October 26th, KMI announced that it would float $1.6 billion in mandatory convertible preferred stock with a 9.75% interest rate and a conversion date three years out. Through the next year, KMI's cash from operations and liquidity will roughly equal its debt and dividend obligations. From [Moody's](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-affirms-Kinder-Morgans-Baa3-rating--PR_337442?WT.mc_id=AM~WWFob29fRmluYW5jZV9TQl9SYXRpbmcgTmV3c19BbGxfRW5n~20151027_PR_337442)

&gt;""Through the third quarter of 2016 Moody’s expects the company will have nearly $11 billion of cash from operations and liquidity resources to fund about the same amount of dividends, capital expenditures and debt maturities. The company will have about $5 billion of cash from operations, together with pro-forma cash of $1.7 billion and an essentially unused credit facility of $4 billion (expires 2019). We expect dividends in the mid-$4 billion range, capital expenditures around $4.5 billion, and debt maturities in Q4 2015 and Q1 2016 totaling $2.4 billion.""

KMI is already carrying $50 billion in debt leveraged almost 6 to 1, and financing is going to remain expensive. In addition to this, KMI's dividend growth is also slowing, with guidance being reduced to a 6% increase for 2016.

So is it a buy? I don't think so. The biggest issues I see for KMI is its size and its exposure to the price of natural gas. It's difficult for companies the size of KMI to sustain the growth needed to support their dividend when financing is so expensive and when their revenue is impacted by the price of the commodity. This has resulted in KMI taking on more and more debt to support growth, and if oil/natural gas doesn't rebound then at some point they're going to have to rethink the dividend. The dividend, by the way, *is* attractive (currently 7.8%). But even if you're bullish on oil you can probably be finding better deals in smaller MLPs that are capable of growing at a much faster rate than KMI.

Disclosure: I own 200 shares of KMI at $26.67. I'm looking to cash out and take my money elsewhere.

I wish I had more time and knew more about this stuff to make a better writeup. Here's things that I'd love to include if I can find out the info for them:

- Take a stab at calculating NAV

- Find pipeline transport statistics and see how they've been impacted by oil/natural gas price

- Calculate the amount of exposure KMI has to the price of natural gas.",22

*Industry profile and Performance*

Companies in this sector sell goods directly to customers, goods such as groceries, clothing, houseware, and other consumer staples. Companies include large multi-faceted corporations such as Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ: COST), but also some smaller ones like Calavo Growers (NASDAQ:CVGW). The sector has performed conservatively YTD, not registering high gains but also keeping little risk, as it weathered the recent corrective storm and is set to remain relatively stable and not as risky as most of the market. Also, the sector is set to outperform the market in the next coming quarters as we move into the late phase of the business cycle. 

*Company History and Profile*

Costco provides a wide range of items – from groceries to furniture – at affordable prices and in large quantities, an annual membership needs to be purchased to shop at Costco. James Sinegal and Jeffrey Brotman founded the company in Issaquah, Washington in 1983; it opened its first store in Seattle. In addition to its retail business, Costco also has its’ own product line marketed under the “Kirkland Signature” brand. As of 15 April 2014, Costco has a total of 672 warehouses, spread throughout the United States (474), Canada (89), United Kingdom (26), Australia (7), Mexico (34), Taiwan (10), South Korea (11), Japan (20), and Spain (1).

*Recent Performance*

COST is an enthusiastic stock, with increasing brand value and customer loyalty. Its’ excellent customer service and reputation have drawn many people to it from other grocery stores like Target or Wal-Mart. COST’s balance sheets also suggests the company’s health, as it only has 45.81% Long Term Debt, which is quite small compared to the industry average of 70.82%, this shows that the company is mature and has little need for outside financing, as it can reinvest most of its cash to fund expansion.  Its debt figures and low beta further reinforce its value as a low risk stable play for solid, steady returns.  Revenue growth has also outperformed the broader industry, with 8.31% growth over the past 5 years (compared to the industry’s 5.85%). COST is up over 8% YTD, compared to the S&amp;P 500 which has fallen 3.02%.

*Analystical Conculsion*

There are many reasons that favor COST such as the natural business cycle progression and its’ strong financials, but Costco also has several non-quantifiable factors that solidify its position as a low risk and steady long-term investment. One of the key qualities that sets Costco apart from its’ rivals is its’ image and reputation, primarily in the humane way it treats its’ employees (especially compared to Wal-Mart) but also due to its’ many philanthropic and local outreach programs in various communities. While the livable wages and philanthropic spending eat into the company’s profit margins, they help by providing good publicity (in lieu of expensive marketing) and by attracting socially conscious customers. The biggest selling point of Costco ; however, is its’ affordability due to its bulk-sale nature, which inspires fierce customer loyalty (so much so that they pay for the right to shop at Costco) and the compassionate customer service, in contrast to much of its’ competition. I believe that this stock is a great long-term buy but a bit overvalued currently, so I would hold off until the price dips a bit to enter.

15-11-09,DD: Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE),"*Industry Profile*

Companies in this sector sell goods directly to customers, goods such as groceries, clothing, houseware, and other consumer staples. Companies range from large multi-faceted corporations such as Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco (NASDAQ: COST), to specialized stores like American Eagle (NYSE: AEO) and Best Buy (NYSE: BBY). The retail sector is poised for strong short-term performance, as sales are rising rapidly (with a 1.2% increase in the month of May) but may see a drop as the US moves into the late-phase of our current bull market, and initiates a contraction period[1]. While the sector overall may see falling share prices in the next 3 to 4 years, the specialty retail sub industry, and the group of stores that offer low cost goods will see an increase in demand, due to worsening economic conditions pushing customers to consider inferior goods and alternative retail. Stores like Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ: FIVE) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ: DLTR) are set to outperform the market over the next few years.

*Company Profile*

Five Below stores offers fair quality merchandise ranging from clothing, accessories, personalized home-goods, technology accessories, fitness apparel, office stationary and a range of board games and outdoor games, all for under five dollars (hence the name: Five Below). Five Below was founded in 2002 by David Schlesinger and Tom Vellios, and opened its first location in Wayne, Pennsylvania on October 4th of the same year, it debuted its IPO on 4/28/2012. It currently has over “360 stores in 21 states” and is headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

*Recent Performance*

FIVE has ramped up the opening of new stores and expansion into more states and localities, and this is reflected in the encouraging sales and net income figures, that grew 27.83% (to $535.4 million) and 60.51% ( to $32.14 million) respectively. FIVE’s balance sheets also suggests a very rare but positive indicator of a growing firm’s health. Even though it is rapidly expanding, it has not drowned itself in debt and obligations, as many new firms do, with its assets outgrowing its liabilities by 12:1 million dollars. Another positive indicator of FIVE’s potential is its rising profit margin (rose by 6.95% in 2014), especially when compared with some of its most important competitors, like Wet Seal (acquired) that saw its margins decline by 22.97%, and Claire’s Stores (NYSE: CLE), which saw its margins decline by 14.32%. Five Below also beat the industry median rise of 2.05%. FIVE also beat the market median sales growth (which was 5.67%) and the market median net income growth and EPS growth (7.45% and 6.66% respectively).

*Conclusion*

Although FIVE has a high beta and consequently high risk, it is well above the market average for many important indicators such as sales, and soaring above its primary competitors. Unlike other high growth stocks, efficient management and an enticing business model that draws in exponentially higher profits every year and keeps costs and liabilities relatively low. It is over $1 higher than its fair market value price, which is a very encouraging metric, as most high growth stocks often experience overreaction and inflated prices, when compared to their true values. As the world economy nears its peak, and fiscal fears lead to conservative spending patterns, consumers will turn to cheaper alternatives for basic goods. These consumers, however, will be turned off by the poor quality of goods from stores like Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR), having grown accustomed to luxury goods during the bull market, and instead seek the high quality/low cost goods available at Five Below stores.

This is a **high risk** long, do not enter right now wait for a few months, but it can grow exponentially over the next few years (hold until at least 2018).",10

#Financials

Right now it's SP is down at 5.65$ (from it's 7.73$ close on thursday) after it dropped heavy on friday's premarket after announcing that that the company intends to offer and sell shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering.
It is pretty oversold right now (RSI @ 30) so there might be some room for a bounce back.
The MACD could set up for a bump as well. 

[RSI&amp;MACD graph](http://i.imgur.com/I1xE6ju.png)

Right now they have 34.5 million US$ and the company believes that their cash, investmens &amp; cash equivalents will fund their operations into Q4 2016.
Their 52w high was 20,72$ and on the last friday they have hit their 52w low which was 5,49$.


---------------------------------

#Risks
As far as I can tell Ganaxalone is their only product. Although they use it as a treatment for multiple illnesses the company might go bankrupt if their med fails/won't get approved, etc....
They also have outstanding debts.
The catalysts here are obviously their ongoing trials and possible Buyout/Partnerships as usual with these kind of biotech companies.


---------------------------------

That's all I can say right now as I have only started to follow this company today. 

This is basically my first DD.
I found out about the company by browsing finviz.com looking for biotech companys with a new low. 
I think their product and research sounds promising. 
If I find an interesting stock I go to stockta and check the MACD and RSI. 
If I see drops or bumps in the chart I try to find out what caused them.
I also visit the homepage of their company and try to find out stuff about their products and ongoing trials (in case of biotech).
I'll do more DD about it and try to share if I find out anything interesting.

Originally management was expecting Q3 EPS of $0.87 and according to Motley Fool, the Wall Street consensus was at $0.99.  MW just last week adjusted that expectation to $0.46-.51.  The result on Friday was shares dropping almost 45%.  They also project sales at established Jos A Bank locations to decrease by 20-25% in Q4 as they rollout a new strategy.  Their plan is to rely less on past promotions like the ""buy 1, get 2/3 free"" and trying things like a rewards based customer loyalty program and better incentive compensation for employees.
So they closed on Friday at $22.68, which is the 52 wk low and lowest since 2010.  Mostly based on my own experience/gut feeling, but I feel like these brands are well established and this will turn around sooner than later.  I could use some help here as to what are good numbers/indicators of future performance and how to understand them.  I've included some below from finviz and marketwatch that may or may not tell the story.  I am at the age where I've been in 2-3 weddings each of the last 4 yrs and they are always renting suits/tuxes from Men's Wearhouse or Jos A Bank, and I don't really see any other real competitors out there.  I've also shopped at both stores and recommend the Egara shirts at Men's Wearhouse as good quality to friends.  Isn't it reasonable to assume that if Jos A Bank really loses that much sales, Men's Wearhouse would likely be gaining most of that lost business?  Maybe that's not even the right question to be asking.
Anyway here are some of the numbers...They have a market cap of $1.1B, Avg Volume 1.79M, PE 39.14, forward PE of 5.68, cash/share ratio = 1.52, debt/equity = 1.63,  and a dividend yield of 3.17%.  Mean analyst recommendation on finviz listed as 2.3 where 1 is buy and 5 is sell.  The marketwatch link also has a sentiment gauge shown at the max Bullish
Is marketwatch a source WSB respects?  I haven't seen much mention of it on here.  Thanks for checking this out and hopefully my incoherent ramblings were somewhat useful

15-11-09,US Dollar Movement,"After Friday's Impressive US employment report, the probability of a December FED rate hike has increased. The US Dollar reigns and we will follow the upward trend as long as there is no driver that could change the current status.

Explanation:

We are expecting the US Dollar to continue gaining ground. The US Non-Farm Employment change from last Friday came in better than economists expected. It showed that 271,000 more people were employed during the month of October, beating expectations of 181,000. The unemployment rate came in at expectations of 5%. This data has increased the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike this December. Also, since we are not expecting any major data out for the remainder of the day, we do not see anything getting in the way of the US Dollar's momentum.

We also expect to see a depreciation in the Euro-US Dollar currency pair as there is a sharp divergence between the tones of both Central Banks. The European Central Bank is bearish on the Eurozone economy. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi stated multiple times last week that the door is still open for an increase in Monetary Easing policies during upcoming sessions. This is causing a strong movement of the EUR-USD to the downside.

There aren't many Canadian tech companies out there. However, looking back at the Canadian tech history; we can see they've been very successful (blackberry).  


Avo is also beginning to look like a growth by acquisition story. Looking back at Canadian history again; very successful (valeant). 

All joking aside, time to get into the DD. 


Avo sells security cameras and software to businesses. We're getting to a point where there'll be security cameras in every business. They're cheap and effective at discouraging bad behavior. Universities, Retail malls, Public transit and Airports are places where having the best security is necessary. 


Competition; Avo's competition are all x10+ bigger than the company. They're also all located overseas in Europe. Not many big players in the Americas. 

Revenues &amp; operating income increased by a fuck ton every year. Decent margins. R&amp;D costs sky rocketing. Issuing debt and buying back shares. Solid balance sheet. Shit the bed in the past few quarters because of resigning cfo, too much r&amp;d costs &amp; didn't meet analyst expectations. Still pretty solid regardless. 

Canada cant fuck it up a third time can it?

15-11-08,DD $NVIV Invivo Therapeutics,"NVIV is a research and clinical stage biomaterials and biotechnology company with their primary focus on SCI (spinal cord injuries).

Their star of the show is a neuro-spinal scaffolding. It is currently in its pilot study with 5 known humans implanted with the device. (patients 1 and 2 are known publicly, and have shown great results)

The FDA recently approved expansion of the pilot from 5 patients to 10, while negotiations are ongoing to move from pilot to pivotal. This resolution could come before years end and might be a boost for the SP.

They are the only company actively working on a solution for spinal cord injury patients by using an implanted polymer device. Once FDA approves the pilot they will work to implement the scaffold + stem cells (which is the true game changer according to the preclinical studies using rat and non-human primate models) 

My opinions:
They could be a good short term play with impending FDA announcement for pivotal before year end, but shorters could continue to bring it down as no news is released. The SP went from $17 to its current $8 since July, and I think it is a good long term play at current prices.

Even if the scaffold improves the lives of SCI patients aside from them walking again it would be a big deal. So far the official released statements for patients 1-5 have been positive and the scaffold is at least safe. Unofficially patients 1 and 2 have been actively showing their results in social media, and their results have been nothing short of remarkable.",18

I'm overall happy with FIT as it gained 4% on friday. Planning to buy more next week.

I expected ATVI to go up on friday but the market reacts in strange ways and I ended up losing $10 even after I made the 4% from Bit.
Should I buy more of it? I would be able to on Wednesday assuming the low price will last.

Their management was shit and ruined the company but I believe in the next couple of months it will be able to rally just enough for a good yolo. In short they make flash based memory for industrial applications (servers/systems n things). Going back through their financials a couple of quarters you can see this company has lost a lot of money and missed earnings. So far for the last three quarters their revenue has slowly but surely increased with the help of new management and they have managed to make a little bit of money.  Their debt is 134 million (just 20 million shy of their market cap), but have 110 million in cash on hand which should last them until they are back on their feet. I'll probably pick up a few shares between 1.50 and 1.70 and hold them until next year. If earnings and income continue to improve over the next two quarters i see no reason for this company to hit at least 3-5 dollars. Their has been some insider buying going on so either people have faith in the company they are now involved in or trying to keep the stock up. Might add more to this in the future if I decide to pick it up. Note: You might be able to make a little bit of money when their earnings are released early december but   i wouldnt recomment it. If the new management has been able to get things under control and fixed (which i think it is doing fine so far) then the pps will probably stay low.

15-11-08,DD: Harris Corporation (HRS),"**[The Company](http://harris.com/annual_report/2015-Annual-Report.pdf)**: [Harris Corporation](http://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE:HRS), is a company that offers advanced, technology-based solutions for government and commercial customers. They employ over 22,000 people – 9,000 of which are engineers and scientists and serve customers in 125 countries.  Their core franchises are Space and Intelligence, Air Traffic Management, Weather, Geospatial Systems, Tactical Communications, and Electronic Warfare and Avionics.


They recently re-aligned into the following four segments: 


**Communication Systems**: Tactical and airborne radios, night vision technology, and defense and public safety networks.


**Critical Networks**: Manages services supporting air traffic management, energy and maritime communications, and ground network operation and sustainment, as well as high-value IT and engineering services.


**Electronic Systems**: Extensive portfolio of solutions in electronic warfare, avionics, wireless technology, C4I, undersea systems, and aerostructures.


**Space and Intelligence Systems**: Complete earth observation, weather, geospatial, space protection and intelligence solutions from advanced sensors and payloads, as well as ground processing and information analytics.

-------------------

**I am the most familiar with their Communication Systems and my DD will be biased along these lines with occasional tangents that I feel somewhat knowledgeable on.**


Their monopoly of the Defense Department’s radio communications spectrum in their Communication System segment is well warranted and they provide the hardware for the Air Force, Navy, Army, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National Security Agency (NSA), and Special Operations Command (SOCOM) in the RF (Radio Frequency) realm.  Being the best-in-class in this field, they also offer their products to the governments of Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, Iraq, United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia as a highlight of their international foot print.  Iraq &amp; Afghanistan obviously from our close relations with their governments and Saudi Arabia, for those that do not know, is the largest consumer of US military goods.


Their Critical Networks segment comprises equipment for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), as well as Shell, Halliburton, Carnival, and Royal Caribbean on the maritime and energy fronts, as well as the Air Force, Navy, and Army in terms of the Department of Defense front (DoD).


Within their Electronic Systems segment, they equip solutions in electronic warfare, avionics, wireless technology, and undersea systems and provide equipment to the Aerospace and Defense Primes of Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman – who are the military industrial complex juggernauts if you were not aware.


In the Space and Intelligence Systems segment, they provide analytics and solutions for advanced sensors for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NRO, NSA, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA – The military’s version of the CIA), and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.


In summary here, If you think of all your body’s sensors (seeing, hearing, talking, feeling, smelling, etc) they’re fully entrenched within the government and military’s most tangible sensors across the board.


-------------------

Now on to their **financials** (I am long – as in retirement long on this position):


They possess a market cap of $9.84B and possess a P/E of 24.83 with 83% of shares being Institutionally owned. Their 10 year return is +89%, 5 YTD: +68%, YTD: +10.8%, with a beta of 1.41. They offer a Div/yield of 0.50/2.51 with that increasing over the last 5 years.


Their most recent earnings report (03 November – 1Q 2016) reported revenue of $1.81B compared to $1.16B in the year prior. Free cash flow was $40M with GAAP net income being $148M = $1.18/diluted share and non-GAAP net income was $163M = $1.31/diluted share. 

-------------------

Before I go into **recent news**, I want to point out some historical aspects of the company. Back in the mid 1990’s the Defense Department was looking to unify their radio communication standards into a program called the [Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS)]( http://www.forbes.com/sites/brianwingfield/2011/02/02/pentagon-efficiency-strategy-gives-harris-corp-a-boost/) to develop a family of **SOFTWARE-defined** tactical radios that enabled networks for sending and receiving voice, data, and video tactical communications on the battlefield. While the program itself eventually died, HRS took it upon themselves to see the writing on the wall and pursued a market-focused approach to tactical radio development. That being said, they’ve deployed over [100,000 radios](http://rf.harris.com/capabilities/jtrs_capabilities/) since then. They were chosen to outfit the Defense Department as a whole with manpack, handheld, as well as vehicular applications with their Falcon family radio back in 2011 that was subsequently increased in 2013 – Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantiy (IDIQ) [contract by $847M](http://harris.com/view_pressrelease.asp?pr_id=3647). Since then, they’ve been the leader in RF technology on the battlefield. In 2012, they were awarded [a contract worth $400M to Special Operations Command (SOCOM)](http://harris.com/view_pressrelease.asp?act=lookup&amp;pr_id=3444) and [another worth $390M in 2015](http://www.defense-aerospace.com/articles-view/release/3/167302/harris-wins-$390m-radio-order-from-socom.html).  More recently, they were awarded [a 10 year, $3.9B contract from the Army for their Rifleman Radio](http://harris.com/press/article.asp?id=3758) in April showcasing their staying power. With the popular use of Special Operations Forces (SOF) for dealing with irregular threats moving forward, and the increased emphasis on recruiting, training, and maintaining a highly capable and adaptable force in this particular regard, I think the trend seen over the last decade or two will continue.


If anyone has paid any attention to Defense spending recently, DoD has been looking to replace its outdated HMMWV (Humvee) across the services under a program called the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) that was [recently awarded to Oshkosh](http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/policy-budget/industry/2015/08/25/oshkosh-wins-jltv-award/32278319/) (a contract worth up to $30B, but is being contested) – who just so happened to create the highly sought after M-ATV, that was the highly successful (in terms of decreasing KIA’s from IED’s) mine resistant ambush protected (MRAP) truck fielded after the HMMWV was decimated from IED’s in the CENTCOM region.  This is semi-relevant due to the fact that all of these newly designed vehicles will need to be outfitted with communications equipment upon delivery.


Outside of their communications domination, they are also the creator of the [“Stingray”](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/26/stingray-surveillance-technology-irs-cellphone-tower) cell-phone tracking technology that spoof cell-phones into believing they are cell towers and swath up identifying information unbeknownst to the users. These devices act as an IMSI-catcher, also known as “cell-site simulators” and have been documented to be used by the FBI, NSA, US Marshals, IRS, and local police department around the US. There have been increased perceptions of law enforcement within the US to use surveillance methods to monitor digital forms of communications with cell phones being a great [resource rich target](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/surveillance-planes-spotted-in-the-sky-for-days-after-west-baltimore-rioting/2015/05/05/c57c53b6-f352-11e4-84a6-6d7c67c50db0_story.html) so these technologies will continue to persist moving forward.


With global conflicts not going extinct anytime soon and the need for time critical information to get to decision makers in a global environment, Harris Corporation is positioned to benefit and be around for the long haul as the leader in tactical communication systems.

-------------------

**I welcome any additional information, feedback, or insight that anyone else can offer as well as contrarian beliefs if there are any.**

But the share value of the company, LGO Energy, dipped remarkably throughout the summer, going from £3.27 to £1.30 at the start of the World Cup.

15-11-09,"DD Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX)","**Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (CLDX)**


**Overview:** 

A biopharmaceutical company specializing in immunotherapy treatments for different cancers.  It currently has no products approved by the FDA, but currently has 7 in development/ trials.
The company has been slowly losing money as they spend more on research, trials to get their treatments tested and approved.  In Q3 they were operating at a 27.3 million dollar loss, with 98.6 million shares outstanding. 
 
Currently there are 8 ongoing trials for CLDX treatments.

On Nov 6. CLDX presented new preclinical data on varlilumab, a fully human monoclonal agonist antibody that binds and activates CD27, a critical co-stimulatory molecule in the immune activation cascade. The data shows that varlilumab works through immune co-stimulation and regulatory Treg depletion on CD27 immune modulation. Varlilumab is currently in phase 1 trials with anti-tumor agents Opdivo and Yervoy. Opdivo(R) and Yervoy(R) are registered trademarks of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Sutent(R) is a registered trademark of Pfizer, Inc. [1]. This good news has gotten investors interested.  Trading volume was 3.3 million on Nov. 6th. Average volume has been 2.3 million.

**Pipeline:**

CDX-1401|Multiple solid tumors|PHASE 1
CDX-301|Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation|PHASE 1
**PRECLINICAL**||		
CDX-014|Ovarian and renal cancer|PRECLINICAL

**Upcoming catalysts:** 


1. Phase 3 study of RINTEGA supposed to finish in December, be available early 2016
An update on the overall survival and long term survival of patients in Phase 2 study will be given Nov 20th.


2. Phase 1 data dose escalation study done, results will be shared shortly.


3. Data from a pilot study of CDX-301 along and in combination with Mozobil will be presented in Q1 2016 [3].


Analysis: I will be the first to admit, I know nothing, but I think this is an interesting opportunity, with a lot of new data being released in late 2015, early 2016, this could really skyrocket the stock.  Recent good news has brought the price from its low in September 10.11.  With good news I can see this stock easily hitting 20-25 in January.

The only escape from my debilitating anger is to PM a AMDA fan with the simple message ""bitch"".

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/1YxFOAQ.png) is the ban email in late September I received for my actions. Keep in mind AMDA was at .40 at the time of the email

* Today AMDA sits at .24 with very low volume. When did AMDA go from .40 to .24 you might ask. Look closely at [this](http://i.imgur.com/XXlCWhe.png) chart. You can clearly see AMDA began to tank after my rage/prediction.

Billy Veatch: Hi Eric, how may I help you?

You: Hi Billy. I have a stock BHRT (BIOHEART INC)

You: I am trying to put in a sell order

You: I am getting this message

You: A security with the symbol BHRT is not recognized as a valid listed security. Use Find Symbol if necessary.

You: I know there was a reverse split and name change

You: And the new name is BHRTD

Billy Veatch: Got it, it won't let you sell until the new shares are received and the shares update.

You: The reverse split happened on Nov 4th is my understanding

You: What are my options?

Billy Veatch: Not much at this point until the new shares are received, which we post as soon as they're received. This can sometimes take several business days.

You: So even though it is being traded in other places, and the symbol has changed on every other bank/website

You: I cannot do anything?

Billy Veatch: You can buy the new symbol, it just won't let you sell the shares you have until the update.

You: And this ""update"" is on CapitalOne's end?

You: Or does this apply to everybody

You: And will it happen randomly during the day? Or during off-hours

Billy Veatch: It applies to our shareholders I know as we have to wait for the physical shares to be sent to us electronically. It normally will happen during a market day when the update comes through.

You: How long does it usually take? It has already been 4 business days

Billy Veatch: It all depends on how soon we get the shares, with stocks that trade on the NYSE or NASDAQ it's usually within 1-2 days. This stock is an OTC Market stock, which can take a few business days or even weeks depending.

You: So this alert ""BHRTD is not available through Capital One Investing.""

You: Is temporary?

Billy Veatch: Maybe, at the present time it's not meeting our criteria for purchase due to concerns with the stock.

You: So it's possible that I have money tied up in a security that I have no control over?

You: That sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

Billy Veatch: Unfortunately, you don't have much control over the shares since they haven't been updated yet.

You: But what you're telling me is that it may never be updated because it doesn't meet criteria due to concerns with the stock?

Billy Veatch: The shares will be updated, not sure if the new symbol will be trading on our website as far as for purchases.

You: So I will be able to sell, but not necessarily be able to purchase?

Billy Veatch: Correct.

You: That sounds awful. O",7

http://imgur.com/gallery/Ow74PVb/new

I saw a $12k loss in my 401k and almost shat myself.  I got assigned on my short AAPL $120 cash-secured puts this weekend, and apparently that's how that transaction shows up in TDA - as a $12k loss.  Considering that the $12k was held as collateral in my non-margin account the moment I sold the puts, that's weird as shit, as getting put the stock doesn't move my account balance at all - it just converted $12k from cash to stock. 

It took me a few minutes to figure that out, and then I had the opposite rollercoaster when I saw that my other account was UP by like 18,000% (despite me knowing there was no way that's possible).  Oh, that's just my deposit hitting the account.  Why the shit would you show it like that and get me all excited?!

Thanks for the emotional rollercoaster on my mostly non-YOLO portfolio, TDA.  The whole reason I'm fairly conservative is so that I don't have to wake up to that type of stress on a Monday.  I need to go long on Depends and BP meds, apparently. 

As an aside: anyone know why they calculate it like this?  Seems really odd and counter-intuitive to me.  The deposit kind of makes sense (as the account balance actually changed in that direction) but I don't get the calculation of the short assignment, as that didn't change my account balance other than the assignment fee $15 and whatever the change in stock price is.

15-11-10,"I am having trouble deciding between Betterment, Wealthfront, and Intelligent Portfolios (Schwab) and am considering an experiment. What are your thoughts on investing some money in all three and tracking performance over a period of time?","I have, set aside, a sum of money to invest (over $100k, less than $1mm). Currently, almost all of my investments have been in just a few index funds at Vanguard, and they have been doing well. I find myself curious about some of the newer robo investing options, and their claim to provide a greater return than investment strategies like mine (basically, a three fund portfolio).

I understand that, at least with Betterment and Wealthfront, they have management fees that must be added on top of the inherent management fees already present in the funds they recommend. Schwab basically keeps a portion of your portfolio in cash (can be as low as around 5%) and favors their own ETFs, which typically have fees that are more expensive than the ETFs that Wealthfront and Betterment recommend (mostly Vanguard). 

What interests me are the potential savings they claim from the frequency and granularity of their tax loss harvesting (and even [Direct Indexing](https://www.wealthfront.com/tax-optimized-direct-indexing) at Wealthfront) and if that would make up for the added management fees.

I am willing to put up some money into each platform at the same time as a sort of experiment to see what the real difference in fees and performance is between them, as well as what their UI/customer service is like. I would keep my existing money with Vanguard.

While that all sounds like a fun idea, I am wondering if that would ultimately create a complex and potentially undesirable situation when it comes time to file taxes given different accounts will be invested in similar equities across three different brokerages. Mainly, I am concerned of the efficacy of the tax loss harvesting being compromised through wash sale rules across the three brokerages. Say Betterment sells ""Direct-Indexed"" Wells Fargo stock while a Schwab ETF buys some.

A few notes:

- Betterment's fees  &lt; $10k .35%, &lt; $100k .25%, &gt; $100k .15%
- Wealthfront's charges a flat .25% fee
- Wealthfront ""Direct Indexing"" TLH starts at &gt; $100k
- Schwab's automatic TLH kicks-in at &gt; $50k
- Schwab

It seems like it would be best to put:

- $100k into Betterment
- $100k into Wealthfront
- $50k in Schwab

 I was thinking something like this:

 * Sort out hard to understand industries where I'm unable to have an edge (biotech and tech)
 * Calculate P/E and P/B for remaining companies. Sort out top 1/3 (or maybe companies with P/E &lt; 25 or P/B &lt; 5 ?)
 * Calculate ROE, top/bottom line growth and interest coverage (or other metrics maybe?). Take the best half to next step
 * Do a 10 minute test on remaining companies (should be 40-50 at this point) including litigation check, over-leverage, commodity dependance, insider ownership etc.
 * End up with the best ~15 companies worthy of a closer look

**Barclays**and **McDonald’s**. are also among companies that will appear at a meeting of the European Parliament’s special tax committee on Nov. 16. **Fiat Chrysler Automobiles**, which hasn’t responded to the committee’s invitation, and **Starbucks**, were told to repay tens of millions of euros in back taxes last month in the first decisions from EU antitrust regulators on fiscal deals that allowed companies to avoid taxes.

**About JA Solar Holdings Co., Ltd.**
  
JA Solar Holdings Co., Ltd. is a leading manufacturer of high-performance solar power products that convert sunlight into electricity for residential, commercial, and utility-scale power generation. The Company is one of the world’s largest producers of solar power products. Its standard and high-efficiency product offerings are among the most powerful and cost-effective in the industry. The Company distributes products under its own brand and also produces on behalf of its clients. The Company shipped 3.1 GW of solar power products in 2014. JA Solar is headquartered in Shanghai, China, and maintains production facilities in Shanghai, as well as Hebei, Jiangsu and Anhui provinces.  
  
**Summary**  
  
JASO closed up 1% today at $8.66. Over the past 6 months this stock has taken a dip and started to recover. It is currently consolidating around $8.70 and appears to have upward momentum. ER will come next Tuesday. Technically the stock appears to be on an uptrend and fundamentally there is new money coming into the company as well as a non-binding offer on the table for $9.69/share.  
  
**Technical**  
  
RSI is currently at 49.22, which I have learned is neither oversold nor overbought. Over the past month the price has been mostly sideways, but supports from the top of the SMA which indicates a positive trend. In the past two weeks we have seen support at $8.25 and the SMA with resistance at $8.80 tested 3 times. Looking at the BB, I see the stock bouncing between the midpoint and the high point for the past two weeks with one break down to the low.  
  
**Fundamentals**
  
JASO filed SEC 13G 10/02/2015 introducing a new investor with 9.9% share of the company. This seems to indicate the company is planning to grow their business. Additionally, as before mentioned, the CEO offered to purchase all outstanding shares of the company for $9.69 a share. This indicates insider confidence in the companies operations. ER from last quarter shows a &gt;300% increase in EPS year over year.

**Risks**  
  
There is a new president of american operations, the change in leadership could prove risky. Additionally, the analysts estimates for this quarter are significantly higher than last year and may pose a challenge to meet.  
  
**Considered Plays**  
  
I would consider swing trading this, buying at ~$8.50 and selling between $8.80 and $8.90 depending on the momentum I saw. I could also see buying in close to $8.50 and holding 'til before earnings. I think there is a pretty high chance the stock will drop after earnings. It's nothing big but could easily net 5-10%.

- GAAP net income for the third quarter of 2015 was $2.3 million, or approximately $0.05 per fully diluted share, compared with $13.5 million, or approximately $0.31 per fully diluted share in the same period of 2014. The decrease was mainly due to changes in stock-based compensation expenses and the fair value of the financial derivatives during the period.

15-11-10,DD - Elite Pharmaceuticals (ELTP),"Mods, I know you asked for DD on non-penny stocks. I wrote about a penny stock. I think Elite is a great investment and has been getting a lot of notice recently, so I hope this will help people decide whether or not they should do some more investigation on their own.


From [their website]( http://www.elitepharma.com/), “Elite Pharmaceuticals is a specialty pharmaceutical company specializing in niche generics and committed to the development of abuse-deterrent opioids to help curb diversion, misuse, and abuse .” While a recent upturn in Elite’s revenue is due to stronger sales in their generic markets (more on that later), it is the abuse-deterrent opioid market that will be Elite’s ticket to the big leagues. If you don’t know how big the potential market is for abuse-deterrent opioids, here are some statistics from [drugabuse.gov](drugabuse.gov).


•	In 2013 207 million prescriptions were written for opioid pain medications (skyrocketing from 76 million in 1991)

•	Estimated that more than 100 million people suffer from chronic pain in the US

•	Approximately 2.1 million people in the US suffered from substance abuse disorders related to prescription opioids in 2012


Elite has a pipeline of abuse-deterrent opioid products, the most prominent of which is ELI-200. If you are interested, read more on how it works [here]( http://www.elitepharma.com/technology-overview/). They have been testing it for some time now and two weeks ago released extremely successful Phase 3 trial results [here]( http://ir.elitepharma.com/profiles/investor/ResLibraryView.asp?ResLibraryID=79416&amp;BzID=2258&amp;t=1948&amp;g=939&amp;Nav=0&amp;LangID=1&amp;s=0) along with expectations that a New Drug Application (NDA) would be submitted to the FDA by the end of the year. Once an NDA is submitted, it takes the FDA up to 60 days to review it and essentially decide if the drug should really be considered for approval. If it is approved in this stage, and I firmly believe it will be, the final evaluation process takes 6 months if expedited or up to 10 months on a normal timeline.


I believe the possibility of ELI-200 passing through the FDA is very high as they have demonstrated very strong results in clinical trials. Furthermore, I think the stock is going to start gaining a lot more momentum once the NDA is announced and will be further propelled by future announcements.  Even if there is a delay in getting through the FDA, there is no company that I know of that is even close to having a similar product that is this close to being ready for market. This all sounds phenomenal, yes? So, let’s turn now to the company’s financials.


First, a note on the nature of biotech valuations. Valuing a biotech stock based on its financials is very different than valuing a company in any other sector because of the highly speculative nature of the industry, hard to predict timelines, high risks, and by extension, high rewards. One of the first things I look at for a very early stage biotech company is the amount of cash on hand (can include liquid assets if you’d like). These companies are not expected to generate substantial revenue until they have products going to market, so a less than stellar income statement should not deter you from delving further into a company. If they have enough cash to fund R&amp;D for long enough to start generating revenue, that can be good enough. This is why early biotech investments can be so risky though. Given that it is difficult to really project a company’s success from the beginning, it can be hard to tell if they will have enough cash to last long enough to bring a product to the market.


Now going back to the subject of this analysis, Elite is not one of these very early-stage companies. They’re beyond the point where the primary concern is, “will they last long enough to bring something to the market?” While ELI-200 is not on the market yet, Elite’s has a portfolio of niche generic drugs on the market that has recently led to strong revenue growth. These drugs should continue to support the company for the foreseeable future . This is something worth being excited about because


1)	Elite has demonstrated that they have valuable products other than ELI-200

2)	Revenue from an established line of generics is allowing them to continue funding R&amp;D on ELI-200 and a host of other drugs in the pipeline.


After reporting revenue of $7.08m in the (last quarter)[ http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=ELTP], Elite announced revenue of $2.7m in the most recent quarter (announced earnings today). R&amp;D costs spiked as well, largely the result of increased spending on ELI-200. Check out the report [here]( http://www.edgarexplorer.com/EFX_dll/EdgarPro.dll?FetchFilingConvPDF1?SessionID=lcRAeS9GCjZu3T9&amp;ID=10999011)


Furthermore, Elite has a partnership agreement with Epic Pharma to handle the distribution of ELI-200. More on that deadl and the $15 million in payments Epic will make to Elite [here]( http://ir.elitepharma.com/profiles/investor/ResLibraryView.asp?ResLibraryID=77479&amp;GoTopage=1&amp;Category=2163&amp;BzID=2258&amp;t=1948&amp;G=939).


*Where it is now*


Those of you that have been following have noticed the stock spike in the past week. I believe there is some pump and dump at play here, as well as plenty of people playing earnings. However, I do not believe this should be cause for much alarm or a reason for investors to avoid ELTP. Let the pumperdumperfuckers take their cash now and buy dips because you’re gonna be the real MVP when ELI-200 makes it to the market and ELTP gets big. Furthermore, I believe that Elite is a solid longer term play as well. Management has been doing some great things with the company and like I said, they have more drugs in the pipeline. Additionally, they could be a strong buyout target for a larger pharmaceutical company.  


*Risks*


The largest risk for ELTP right now is a failure to get ELI-200 through the FDA. Not only do I think this is very unlikely, but I don’t think it would mean the end for them either given their already strong portfolio of other drugs. 


I really don’t like giving price targets, other than suggesting that ELTP has significant upside potential and limited downside risk, especially for patient investors. Best case scenario right now is that ELI-200 is approved and takes over the prescription opioid market. Aside from most likely being popular amongst physicians, this is a product that the US government could definitely support in some way. If an NDA is submitted by the end of the year as expected, I would look for ELTP to hit $1.00 by the end of the year. Getting ELI-200 through the FDA could see that amount increase tenfold. The CEO conference call to discuss earnings is tomorrow, 11/10, and we could hear more forward guidance then. Until then, I would be cautious making an entry given the recent run up, but again, if you’re patient, I think this stock will be a bargain anywhere under $1. 

I hope this was at least a little bit helpful. Happy investing!

15-11-10,I am trying to learn how to value stocks and have a question about Cosan Limited,"Like the title says, I am looking to invest beyond Vanguard index funds, and as such I am trying to learn how to value stocks. I have a question about [Cosan Limited](http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=CZZ). It has some really weird numbers, and it'd be awesome if someone could explain what's going on with this company.

So the confusing numbers first. The company's stats are:
&gt;Stock price: $3.57

&gt;Trailing P/E: 446.25 (!!!)

&gt;Forward P/E: 1.21 (???)

&gt;Market Cap: 944.94M

&gt;EV: 5.50B

&gt;Revenue: 2.68B

&gt;EV/R: 2.06

&gt;EV/EBITDA: 9.38

So obviously Cozan has a *ton* of debt looking at the EV vs. Market Cap. But it still manages to have a pretty good EV/R and EV/EBITDA despite that due to having a revenue well over twice its current market cap. And what on Earth is going on with the trailing and forward P/E??

Cosan is a Brazilian company that produces sugar can, ethanol, and some lubricants if that helps. I'm not sure if that's a good market (still need to look into that) and I don't know how well it does against its competitors beyond what [Stockflare](https://stockflare.com/stocks/CZZ) is telling me. Any help in trying to figure out if Cozan is a winner or a loser (and why) would be much appreciated!",9
15-11-10,Rental Property vs Dividend Stocks,"This is a long post - hope you have the patience to read through it! 

I had a duplex rental for 1.5 years and chose to sell it. I would like you guys to see my logic as to why I chose to have dividend earning stocks vs rental income. Please find any loopholes you can, or take it as a learning opportunity. Please note, the tax rules I am using are for Canada so I'm sure it will not apply everywhere.

Paid 340k for a duplex. Rent was 1150 for a two bedroom and 1250 for a three bedroom. Plus utilities for both apartments. Had probably the best tenants I could ask for but I've learnt something. Regardless of they are good or not, renters are renters. They expected everything to be fixed immediately. (Example: lock didn't want to turned at 2am which apparently had been an on going issue for 2 months yet they never told me, I wanted to lubricate and let it sit in the morning, they demanded I call a lock smith immediately. Me not calling one caused them to despise me a little). Things would get me worked up easily after that but I had to keep a happy face with them. 

Expenses: approx 850 (interest portion of 1200 a month mortgage) + 310 (prop tax) + 110 (insurance). That works to 1270 and rent brought a total of 2400 before tax. That's 1130 per month profit! Seems ridiculously good doesn't it? Well maybe to an outsider.

Now a few costs not mentioned here with buying a rental is: land transfer (mine was 3575), bank mortgage fee (700 - but this would be paid to borrow either way), lawyer (2000), house inspection (560). This does NOT include selling costs which would include lawyer + realtor fee (unless you sell private) and potential IRD bank penalty if you sell within a mortgage term (this one cost me 6k!).

It was consuming me, I work between 50-60 hours a week at my job, make good money as it is, then on top of that had to worry about the rental - even when nothing was going wrong.

I figured I'd compare it to dividend paying stocks (and ignoring any capital gain). The assumption would be no major repairs were made and my tenants did not ever leave with it being empty for one month and with the stocks side that the company did not cancel out a dividend payment. So I compared it to borrowing the same amount of money from the bank at the same rate and place it in dividend paying stocks. I designed a solid blue chip portfolio that paid approx 4% which would be approx 1133 per month (taxed at only 8% so long as I invest in Canadian companies vs rent which was 32%). The expense here would be interest of approx 850 per month only (which is claimed and returns approx 32% at income tax time).

The only fees with dividend stocks would be the commission cost, which generally is 10 to buy, 10 to sell. To diversify I bought 22 companies so the purchase price was 220. Generally, to set up a HELOC there would be a 700 dollar fee just as a mortgage, but there was a promo so I didn't have to pay it.

The tax breakdown: 

In Canada, dividend paid by a Canadian Corporation at my tax bracket is taxed at 8%, whereas income (rent) is taxed as 32%.

Rental: 
(income - expenses) * (100% - income tax rate) 
(2400 - 1270) * (100% - 32%) = leaving me with 768.40 per month 

Dividend Stocks (yield 4%): 
(dividend * (100% - div_tax_rate)) - (expenses * (100% - income tax rate)) 
(1133 * (100% - 8%)) - (850 * (100% - 32%)) = 464.66 per month 

Difference 
768.40 - 464.66 = 303.74
193.54 * 12 months = 3644.88 (or 1% annually on 340k)

I felt like the difference in ""income"" was worth it, considering my stocks don't call me (yet!). Both housing market and stock market can crash, so I ignored that fact for now, but kept it in the back of my mind. I also do believe that housing price does fluctuate just as much as stocks do, only you can't login to a website and see the price change second by second. This brings me to a benefit of stocks - liquidity. The shingles on my rental would have to be replaced in 2 years, which would be another upcoming cost (at least this one is planned!).

I sold my rental for 390k making a profit - so I can't say I regret my decision. I ended up getting a 150k line of credit (HELOC) locked in for 4 years at the same rate of mortgage interest rates to buy stocks. I know I keep mentioning borrowing the same amount - but that was for simplicity of comparing. I felt like borrowing less at the start was a good way to do it, then perhaps borrow more at a later date.

Hope you find my logic helpful, if not tell me why. Please note I am not a professional by any means, this is simply my opinion (and I hope no one points out issues in my math!)",138

15-11-10,DD: Pump and Dumps,"With the AVXL slaughter getting worse, I thought it would be a good moment to share my knowledge on these pump and dump stock schemes.

My personal experience began with a stock called Lifeline Biotech ($LLBO).  These guys are in possession of the latest and greatest equipment that is actually a bra THAT DETECTS BREAST CANCER!  How fucking neat is that shit?  It's real fucking neat until you realize that the product itself probably doesn't exist and the company is a scam.  I purchased $LLBO in 2009, and by the grace of the YOLO gods I managed to exit just this past summer at 100% gain because some scumbag started the promotion again.  

I wish I could say that I've always managed to double my money on promotion stocks.  It certainly is possible, but highly unlikely.  I've gotten bent over more by promoted penny stocks than I care to admit.  I would have massive green paydays from awesomepennystocks.com picks.  +30%, +70%, +145%...  That was until the play I went large on they decided to pull out the soup can girth black dildo and go to town on my shallow butthole.  My whole fucking account was wiped out because I made a stupid play and refused to cut my losses until I hardly could.  The stock symbol was $AWSR and [here's a good article about](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-17/bugatti-driving-26-year-old-tied-to-penny-stock-website) how the asshole ran the scam.

So how does this apply to WSB and you?  Take a look at $AVXL today and that's how it applies.  To anyone holding $AVXL still, find the nearest mirror and take a good look at yourself.  You are a looking at a bag holder.  PROMISE yourself that you are never going to be a bag holder again!  Your YOLO dollars deserve better.

How does it work?  Like a snowflake, every promoted stock is different.  Maybe it's a mining company that just found a vast stockpile of resources in some far away land.  Possibly it's a vitamin company that already has a product on store shelves.  And a lot of the time it's a biotechnology company with the promise of a profound answer to one of life's many problems.  Sound familiar?  Stock tickers are registered on the OTC, share structure is created, and then at fractions of a penny, these shares are distributed to the people who will eventually profit from the upcoming promotion.  After that, the stock promotion can take many forms.  Shitty websites send out their newsletters telling you to get in on this newest opportunity.  “Get in now!”  Emails from random websites promoting the stocks begin pouring out.  Hell, even hard copy mailers will arrive at your house showing you all of these Fox News correspondents who are saying to buy this company.  If black guy from Fox Business is buying the stock why shouldn’t I?  Those are the traditional stock promoting methods.  Pair this with the ability to promote stocks with social media like Twitter, Facebook, Stocktwits, and EVEN this subreddit is a platform where stocks are promoted.  Promoters are sometimes paid with cash.  I’ve personally seen $5k, $10k, $25k, all the way up to $300k paid to promote stocks.  Other times the promoters are paid with shares of the stock they are promoting. With all of this faux demand generated by marketing the stock symbol itself, the price obviously rises.  After a certain amount of time the people who own this stock become promoters themselves.  How many of you have posted your own “DD” on $BGMD or $AVXL recently?  Forums become an echo chamber of self-serving nonsense.  Eventually demand completely evaporates, behind that liquidity, and then the stock goes on a murderous rampage plummeting below even the lowest stop loss.  Then you’re fucked and holding a bag.  I bet a high % of subscribers here have been through this at least a few times.

How do I protect myself from a stock promoter?  First and foremost be skeptical of ANY STOCK under $4.00 especially if it is on the OTCBB, pink sheets, grey market, etc.  Even the NASDAQ is susceptible to pump and dump schemes as you’re seeing with $AVXL now.  Next, you need a subscription to http://stockpromoters.com.  I’m not promoting the site, I think it is garbage, but they email out what scumbag is promoting what shitty company.  I have received and archived their emails for years.  Any time some clown on this sub pumps a penny stock I simply type the symbol into my email search.  If ANYTHING from that site comes up, the stock is immediately discredited in my mind and I move forward without touching it.  Go to the OTC website and check out the company.  Have they always been trying to cure Alzheimer’s?  [Or were they formerly in the printing business?](http://i.imgur.com/VmxxkwX.jpg)

TLDR; Pump and dump chicks, not stocks.

made me want to post my own note about the types of trades we all discuss here and to explain/remind everyone about how this is different from actual betting.

If you place a bet in a casino or at a race track, on blackjack or a sports event or whatever it may be, you take a risk with your money, wait a period of time......but then, critically, someone tells you the outcome and either pays you or tells you you lost.

That doesn't happen when buying stocks.  It's up to you to decide the outcome.  And whether it's YOLOing on penny stocks or allocating your 401k, the thing all investors are the worst at is deciding when to exit investments.

There will always be new opportunities.  Life is long.  If you make a good profit on one of these random stocks we diligence here - do not be afraid to get out.  You will never go wrong exiting at a profit.  Don't wait for someone to tell you that your gain is all you're ever going to get.  Take your newly found money and get out.

If you need a good further life lesson in this, watch tonight's final table of the WSOP.  These are actual people betting for a living, with millions on the line.  And while poker isn't remotely a game of pure chance - watch how they play.  Even when they have a big hand that they could maybe extract more value from, watch how they just take the pot available to them and move on to the next one, knowing it's better to stack chips at a profit one hand at a time than get caught overreaching.  

Do the same in your portfolio, if you're ""betting"" on stocks you don't really have any more confidence in other than some reddit diligence post - stack profits on them one opportunity at a time and move on.  You're not going to miss out on becoming a billionaire because you don't hold for one more day.",31

15-11-10,DD: Biodel Inc (BIOD) - Trading below cash ~.36,"I do not currently have a position in this stock. It has appeared on my screener a few times as a potential bounce play so I did about 25 minutes of quick and dirty (how your mother likes it) DD to see if it is any good. I will not and you should not open a position WITHOUT MORE DD.

---------------
**Company Basics**

[Biodel](http://www.biodel.com/) is a specialty bio-pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative treatments for diabetes that may be safer, more effective and more convenient for patients.

The two main products in their pipeline are a Glucagon Emergency Management Kit, a room temperature stable glucagon presentation for use as a rescue treatment for diabetes patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia, and BIOD-531, a insulin formulation designed to be more rapid-acting than the formulations currently available to Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes patients.

---------------
**The Fall**

BIOD was trading over $1 back in August when the two pipeline drugs I mentioned above got delayed by the FDA. Glucagon kit due to the FDA disagreement with the design of the trial and BIOD-531 was delayed because the FDA wanting more data on the newly developed syringes Biodel was using specifically for this product. These two delays caused Biodel to drop below $1 and later get delisted from Nasdaq which as we've seen with other stocks (BGMD) put this baby in the shitter. It's been in the .35-.37 range for going on a month now.

---------------
**The Play(s)**

* Cash - According to their filings they had $44M at the end of Q2'15 and a burn rate of about $6.5M. Assuming a repeat burn their Q3'15 cash will be $37.5M. With 65,151,202 shares outstanding for cash price per share at .57. Just because a company has cash doesn't mean the share prices has to at least match it so 'play 2' is also a factor here
* Recovery - **THIS WILL REQUIRE A TON MORE DD** - You could bet on the pipeline getting its shit back together. From what I read the Glucagon Kit delay has ended but it will be 6 months+ before anymore catalysts come from it. The announcement of the delay ending appears to have had no effect on the stock price. When the BIOD-531 delay is resolved there might be potential for a bounce there as well. Or it could do nothing like the Glucagon Kit continuation did.

---------------
**Disclaimer**

I want to repeat that I have no position in this stock and you should not open one without more DD. You fuckers have a habit of rushing into dumpster fires. This was quick as fuck, don't trust anything I said. This could be gold or it could be a shit nugget. Figure out which it is so you don't invest in a shit nugget.",2

15-11-10,REM - a possible triple-bottom at support with a 14.8% yield,"The question for REM, the iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped ETF, is it at a triple-bottom support or on a pause in an obvious down trend before a plummet into oblivion?

But the real question may be — is the technically over-sold condition in REM a sign that all the bad news from the Federal Reserve’s upcoming anticipated interest-rate hike already in the stock?  Hard to tell, it is already down eight percent for the year.  That may be enough.

The stock, which closed today at $9.91, has a yearly range from $12.69 to $9.76.

The triple-bottom at $9.76 is only a possibility since it always takes a confirming rally to complete the technical formation.  That clearly has not happened…yet.

Almost needless to say, the ETF’s current 14.83 yield (as of Oct 31, according to Yahoo Finance) is compelling.

And, at this point the good news for traders, and for long-term investors who refuse to look at red ink each day no matter what the yield, is the stop loss, if the down trend is bound to continue, is nearby.  Quite frankly I, for one, do not want to be here if this possible triple-bottom at 9.75 gets taken out (after all this could also be, technically speaking, a massive descending triangle with lots of downside left…gulp!).

Concerning the results: First off, these results were over a 5 WEEK PERIOD. There were poisitive results after 5 weeks. MMSE ,which max score is 30, went up 1.5 for these people. That is a 5% increase, it's no yolo gain but it is damn better than /r/investing. And let me reiterate: after only 5 weeks. The EPR increased significantly with a significant p-value. Over 12 weeks, patients increased their ACDS-ADL by 3.51 points, which is a 4.1%. These are very good results over not a long period of time. And the trial continues! Drugs do not work immediately. They take time and change people over time.

Concerning the study: This is a phase 2 trial. It does not need to be double blind. And even though it is not double blind, does not in any way make these results insignificant. Double blind is the gold standard of science and it is great and when Anavex does phase 3 it will be double blind and we will see how the results hold up. The purpose of the study was for safety which was met and to see if the drug had any efficacy. It did. 

Now we wait for more results.

I own this stock and will continue until someone can show me a GOOD reason not to. 

Edit: I did not and will not in the future be working on Anavex 2-73 trials.

15-11-10,The Myth of Rate Hike = Stock Crash,"I've been seeing a lot of posts here lately about how the rate hike (presumed to be in December now) is going to adversely affect the US Equity market. 

I don't blame you guys. In the last 10 years, we have seen rate cuts, to ZIRP, to NIRP. As a trader, I'm aware that during the QE phases over the last few years, any talk about ""normalizing"" rates sent the market into a free fall. Look no further than last week and today (Monday) when the Fed hinted at a December hike. 

Spooky stuff if this is the dynamic you grew up with and how you learned to trade over the last few years. New QE program? BUY! No mention of a rate hike? BUY! Pretty simple.

Now many of us young YOLOers out there are facing their first rate hike. You sensed the panic in today's trading. Oh no, the spigot from the Fed is finally going to be turned off! What do we do! Time to panic!

I made this post to assuage your fears out there about the inevitable rate hike. Let me first ask you gents, where else is there for the big money to go? Europe? Euros? Rubles? Yuan? Yen? China? Brazil? Bonds?

Some think that the tide will wash out of equities and back into bonds post-hike. But is that really the case? What is the nature of interest and inflation, and how are they connected? What about money and assets, and their correlation? What does the interest rate really imply about the economy?

What if I told you that ALL assets, including stocks and commodities, rise when interest rates rise? 

What if I made the bold declaration that as interest rates rise, people will shy AWAY from government debt since for decades now it has all been financed on the short-term so any tick in rates will obliterate the budgets of governments worldwide?

Finally, what if I told you that the US Share Market is going to likely DOUBLE in the 12 months following December?

Madness, I know, but this is a mad world and there are many other factors at play here besides the Fed and the Stock Market. For one example, over $9tn in USD-denominated debt has been created outside of the US in recent years (due to low rates), which is almost HALF the entire US National Debt. Those governments are now in a real pinch as dollar strength crushes their bottom lines.

I know you guys would like some sauce so here it is. I read this guy's blog daily so you can see where I get most of my shit from. I will say that this guy's arguments are absolutely COMPELLING and at the very least worth a read. 

What's most amazing is that as I skimmed through these articles looking for sauce, one of them was written in January and he said the DOW would peak in May. This guy has made very spot-on calls. 

Disclaimer: he does not proofread. I am giving you a bit of a history textbook right now, but they are VERY worth the read as it will open your perspectives to the fact that the markets are not isolated but more like a rain forest ecosystem. These are in chronological order.

If you want the TL;DR: Markets and commodities will be in an accelerated rally AFTER the Fed hikes rates.

Telus is expanding Fibre to home Internet in many Canadian cities including mine. I have it in my house and most of my city has it too, it isn't cheap, but it is by far the most reliable and fastest. Also they are a solid cellular carrier. I spend $300 a month, every month on telus products and I don't see that changing. 

When I see a company willing to spend big and offer free installation (you don't need to sign up to use it but they will install free of charge) of Fibre to home to damn near ever home in my city growing thier client base and giving people what they want (fast reliable Internet) I start thinking this company is going to do well.

So first off. I'm 19, in college, and only want to invest a maximum of $200 on penny stocks to begin with. If I make money, I'll definitely increase that amount, but I just wanna test the waters and see if this is for me.

Secondly, I need to read. A lot. Is Investopedia pretty decent? I reckon it should have most information I can find in any books.

Third, is there any place I can paper-trade penny stocks online? I'll paper trade for a bit just to get the hang of it, after I've read up on trading. I want to go into this as educated as I can be, because I'm not interested in being irresponsible and learning lessons that could have been avoided the hard way.

To change the vibe of all the D's, I'm going to do a small pitch based mostly on TA on the 2015 December WTI crude future. The indicators that I'm using are purely mathematical, which do not mean that are 100% reliable but they will help us get a picture of the trading trend of the past few days. My first indicator is the William %R, which as you can see just went under the threshold of -80 and seem it will stay there for at least tomorrow. This tell us the contract are currently being oversold which mean it might be a good time to take a position. To further my analysis, I also used the RSI to give a bit of weight to my first indicator. As we can see, the RSI is flirting with the 30 level, hence reaffirming the contract is currently being oversold. But to further affirming my hypothesis that oil will continue going up after today rally, I'm waiting for the SMA (10) to crosses above the EMA (30), which should happen tomorrow in the early trading hour, if the OPEC announcement don't affect too much the price. I'll be aiming for an exit price at around 47.60$ so it can reach the previous high of last week. I'll be also using a stop-loss order at 43$, so my feelings won't take over if the price goes south. Since this is a future contract, we got to keep in mind that every 1$ increase is a 1000$ profit per contract, but if it goes down 1$, we will be subject to a 1000$ loss per contract. In conclusion, I'm long on this contract for the near future.

Disclaimer: This is for a short term position and is my personal opinion and should be taken with a grain of salt. I DO NOT have a position and I won't be taking a position since I do not have the capital to do it. This is for a simulation that we are doing for school so I do take this seriously. TA doesn't guarantee any positive return and one should its own analysis depending on their risk tolerance. Technical analysis is not a science it's an art. I'm not a professional just a random guy.

Before the idea became mainstream, I can't see how people would be about to buy a stock, and then suddenly go 'oh no! it hasn't gone past a dollar figure from 2 weeks ago! Better not buy!' I don't see how a few figures estimated from past dips and peaks can predict momentum.

Is there any actual proof it works?",1

And it could be another six months before Oracle actually launches these services.

15-11-10,"Tired of AVXL, why not try SUNE?","So this sub is pretty much entirely AVXL right now, I thought I would switch it up. I'm sure you have all heard of SUNE, even if you don't follow it. Essentially they are the giant elephant in the room in the renewable energy development/epc market. Like huge af. Every time the company I work for (small private solar epc firm) responds to an rfp or other bid, someone from SUNE is there. 


Anyways, their stock has taken a huuuuuuuge shit lately. Like to the point it's not even funny anymore. It's currently trading for less than $6. Less than 6 months ago it was touching $34 a share. Yes, it was overvalued then, and yes they have a lot of debt. They have been buying some things that many people don't think will make sense (ahem VSLR ahem). Other than that hiccup, which there is chatter over that deal not actually closing now due to backlash, they are sitting on awesome investments. The projects they are building out, whether they are selling or holding via one of their yieldcos, are super good investments. These projects have contracted revenue streams that are typically 20 year terms, and most have price escalators. There is very little o&amp;m too, so it's mostly bankable cash flow. Think slightly higher credit risk than a bond, but returns between 7&amp;15%+. 


Also, after today's drop, they are literally trading for the amount of cash they have on the books!!! They have $2.3 billion dollars in cash guys! Yes, I know there is debt to accompany that, but as I said above, these projects are super reliable cash flows. I think that this is a super great opportunity to get in right now. Give it a while, maybe a little longer than your normal yolo timeframe, but within 6 months to a year I am betting that we will see over $15 a share. Just so you faggots don't think I'm just pumping, I bought in more today at $5.91. I'm not rolling in the stacks or anything but I have a solid 370 shares.

15-11-11,My play for the year - WMT price target 68 near end 2016.,"https://www.tradingview.com/x/gWenpLnI/

Each red line represents a portion of HV and expected rebound levels. 

They also represent entry points.  Even during the 08 crash, walmart only tanked about 30%.  Recently it did just that from 80s to 58. These levels also represent potential pivot points. If you look at this historically, a lot of the rebounds happen off these lines, which are also very close to past support/resistance areas.  Each of these levels has a 50/50 chance of rebounding, the closer they are to past resistance/support areas, I'd say its closer to 60/40. 

With that said, to play this, your best bet is to set aside a certain % that you're okay with losing 100% of. ideally 2-5%. Up to 10% for smaller accounts that need 'dem gainz'.  Whatever that amount is, divide it over the 7 entries (red lines). If you're more conservative, divide it over 12 entries (all the way to levels of 1992).

If your account is large enough, its best to sell ATM puts at each of these levels, expecting to be put shares, a long with a back month call. Your expected Return can range from just dividend + annual gain, to dividend + annual gain + options premium (call + put). 

This is a very conservative play, so its not for everyone.
 
The main goal of this is to collect dividends  + some. These won't be those sexy 100-200% gains you get from going all in on one or two stocks, but this strategy will be viable long term as long as you keep adjusting to market conditions.

Normally you would think people would happy with this, considering the stock has traded around $4-$6 for so long, but the vast majority of long term shareholders bought in for $15+. This is a dreadful day for a ton of people.

Still, at least 20% of the shares are going to vote yes (institutions) and 25% more traded today. I would say the people selling are retail investors and the people buying are more institutions/other phrama companies. I see this playing out one of two ways:

1. Shareholders fail to vote against the buyout because there are too many institutions that will vote yes
2. A second bid comes in

Either way, the answer right now is to buy. Either you break even or you get what the next guy bids. I don't see how it could really be voted down. ",6

3D printing is in it's very early stages of usefulness. Crudely printing a cube or a toy doll isn't much of anything. Technology will get better though over the next several years. At some point, 3D printing will become very powerful and practical.

Right now, there are many companies who are making 3D printed prosthetics. These prosthetics receive signals from your nerves and will move the way you want them to move.

As printing technology gets better, so will the prosthetic technology and capabilities.


There are a lot of 3D printing stocks out there. Do you think buying them is a solid bet? The technological usefulness is there. It's really just about whether or not something better comes along before it gets a chance to become advanced.

The most important ""DD"" is the DD about how stocks trade...not what the company does. Let's face it, 99% of you were looking for a quick pop on AVXL and bought high, because you thought the ""DD"" would make it go insanely high. You thought that you would be banging hookers and doing coke with midgets on your yacht by now...

In the midst of the assload of ""DD"" that was consistently shoved down your throats. nobody stopped and said ""hey...maybe this piece of shit is overbought?""...

If you ignore price metrics on stocks you will ALWAYS LOSE. Another thing was that the ""DD"" seemed to be extremely one sided. The red flags were ignored by most... 

Regardless of what you read in a ""report"", you must account for the technical aspect of trading. The stock was up 7 days in a row, only one day had decreasing volume, and it closed higher than its open every day...what were you expecting?... It was bound to implode...nothing lasts forever. 

And when I say technical, I'm not referring to bollinger bands, moving averages, etc. Technicals are lagging in my opinion, and I don't use them...but this is just my opinion...

Study the habits of traders...that's the most important DD. Listen, everybody has a cure for something, everybody has the next big thing, after 15 years of trading, I've seen and heard it all...traders move the market. If you know what they'll do, what the company does is irrelevant.

Also, stop buying stocks on a whim, come up with a strategy that will give you consistency, don't just see some shit in a post and say ""Hey I'll put 100% of my available capital in this...for no reason""...

Overall, the number of dollars people have had available to save has been more than the number of dollars people have wanted to spend from their investments. What happens over the next 15-20 years?

Boomers will start to retire, and start drawing money down from these funds faster then they were putting it in. The available workforce will shrink, and the millennials and echoes (who have student loans and mortgages that are a high percentage of their incomes then was the case for their parents, not to mention don't have forced retirement savings in the form of defined benefit pensions) will not be buying many investments; they'll be at best paying down debts. 

Doesn't supply &amp; demand on the stock market dictate that prices will go down? There will be lots of boomers trying to sell their shares, and not a lot of buyers. No matter what a business's fundamentals are (in terms of EPS, dividends, etc) if a millennial doesn't have cash to spare in their personal budget, then they aren't even participating in the market.

15-11-11,DD: Zafgen (ZFGN),"Or, as my friend likes to say with his autocorrect, Zangief. But that's neither here nor there...

Zafgen was founded in 2005. Its main objective is to treat severe obesity. Zafgen's main drug is called [beloranib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beloranib), an injectable weight loss drug. Zafgen [licensed](http://www.zafgen.com/zafgen/our-approach/beloranib) beloranib for worldwide use (except South Korea) from CKD Pharma, which originally discovered the drug, and its use, after several years of research into it.

[Beloranib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beloranib), an analog of the natural chemical compound fumagillin, is a [METAP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAP2) inhibitor. METAP2, among other things, is an enzyme that helps create new blood vessels. The theory goes that if you inhibit METAP2, you inhibit fat growth, and this is indeed what has happened in Phase 2 trials, the first of which ended in 2013.

Zafgen has been conducting multiple beloranib trials, including, prominently, for [PWS -- short for Prader–Willi syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prader%E2%80%93Willi_syndrome), a rare genetic disorder that causes, among other things, obesity and hyperphagia, or uncontrolled eating/hunger. This trial is called ZAF-311. There is also a planned (mostly) European trial, for European approval, called ZAF-312. [Beloranib has an orphan drug designation in Europe](http://ir.zafgen.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=934399).

------------------------------------------

Zafgen IPOed in 2014. Lots of options to the long-suffering management and so on. Price appreciates, everything going well, everyone is happy. Starting at ~$20 at/near IPO to $low 40s/high 30s. Recently, mid/low 30s with the biotech crash in September. Closes on October 9 at $34.40.

Then, Columbus Day rolls along. Stock market open but many businesses closed -- including Zafgen. Zafgen cancels investor conferences. No one knows why. Lots of speculation. People think maybe a patient in a trial died? Adam Fuerstein bashes it for saying nothing as the stock crashes, and the stock plunges further.

By then I'm already looking into it.

Stock is at $14 on Thursday, October 14. ~55% haircut on no news. I consider buying it. Chicken out. Then there's a trading halt. Patient death announced. Stock crashes 10% after the halt. Restarts again. I still don't buy. Stock crashes AGAIN to high 10s. I still don't buy.

Meanwhile I am posting on Yahoo Messageboards that death might be good news for stock -- why? because patient death rate for those who aren't even on the trial (prader-willi syndrome PWS) is a historical 3% already, and, importantly, the FDA isn't halting the trial. I'm a stock whisperer. Stock doubles up in the next few hours as shorts get absolutely ripped apart.

Right at this moment, no one knows (including Zafgen) if death is patient on placebo or beloranib. 33% chance it was on placebo. Friday, Zafgen is informed by those running the trial that death was on beloranib, and informs investors that 6 thrombotic events happened in 450 patients on beloranib in all its trials, versus 0 in placebo. FDA sets a partial clinical hold on all current trials (ZAF-311 and ZAF-203) -- which requires Zafgen to run a thorough thrombotic disease risk assessment for current patients, and requires Zafgen to run ZAF-312 (mostly Europe but some US patients) after a risk and efficacy assessment and discussion with the FDA.

Insane bloodbath ensues that Friday. Stock runs down all day to low $10s. I buy in half my position, then the other half next week.

Zafgen decides to end the randomized portion of both current trials early (ZAF-311 being about 90% complete) a few days later. Since ZAF-311 has a non-randomized open label portion, they can still stay on the drug after trial completion for a few months. All but 2 patients, as evidenced by the ER yesterday (November 10) elect to stay on to receive the drug in ZAF-311. (even those on placebo)

No one even knows whether beloranib actually caused the thrombotic events, but the stock price is what it is.

------------------------------------------

Fast forward to now and I did a massive amount of DD, including [this](http://pastebin.com/NZ8wWV7k) (which [Zafgen also covered yesterday, November 10 -- thanks to ""kaush"" for the screenshot from the CC](http://charts.stocktwits.com/production/stream_45246473.PNG?1447192349)). This shows that the vast majority of deaths in PWS are from obesity and hyperphagia (uncontrolled eating/hunger) This means that if beloranib treats obesity to a significant degree, it will greatly reduce these obesity- and hyperphagia-related deaths.

Beloranib has had good success in all Phase 2 trials so far in reducing weight. You can find some posters on Zafgen's site here:
http://www.zafgen.com/zafgen/newsroom/media-library (click the SCIENCE tab)
The Phase 2 trial showed a 60% hyperphagia (uncontrolled hunger as mentioned earlier) and rapid weight loss. (about 11% in 12 few weeks in the Phase 2 PWS patients)

[There's also a decent amount of Seeking Alpha articles](http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZFGN).

In the CC yesterday, (November 10), 5 of the now 7 events (the death was preliminarily caused by a thrombotic event) are dismissed as entirely unrelated to beloranib. That, coupled with hyperphagia reduction and weight loss benefits (optimistically, 20-30%), means in my opinion that this drug will likely be approved by the FDA and its European counterpart, and become part of the standard of care for PWS patients as, at the very least, an orphan drug. I estimate conservatively about $480-$720 million in yearly revenue just from PWS and severe obesity in Europe and the US.

------------------------------------------

[The CC on November 10](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3674356-zafgens-zfgn-ceo-tom-hughes-on-q3-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) had a minor ""earnings"" beat (6 cents), and will have a beat for the year because they are delaying ZAF-312 till next year, due to the terms of the FDA's partial clinical hold as described above.

Here is the [CC Seeking Alpha transcript](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3674356-zafgens-zfgn-ceo-tom-hughes-on-q3-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) and [earnings presentation slides](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-2THTXI/859816591x0x860817/99FFD87E-727A-431B-AC83-A7E96A2DDC1F/ZFGN_3Q15_Earnings_Slides.pdf).


The CC also showed how important PWS treatment is, and potentially provided a signal of safety and efficacy, with only 2 patients out of 101 deciding to opt out of the open-label extension.
The data for the ZAF-311 trial will be released in Q1 of 2016.

I see this climbing back up to high 20s or even high 30s within a month.

Importantly, hedge funds have not sold off their positions and one new hedge fund has a large position in it (Foresite Capital)... I think [5.5%](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374690/000114420415060510/v422657_sc13g.htm), although I am not 100% sure.

I've lurked for a while on WSB, trying to gain some knowledge before putting anything to use.  I trade on my own, but don't have enough money to make any YOLO bets.

The fund will be long-only, using the same investment process as the global equity fund that seeks to identify stocks, sectors and countries which are experiencing structural or fundamental change that investors are slow and reluctant to recognise.

Investors flock to liquid alternatives as global volatility persists
Manager Rogers recently wrote in a blog: ""Structural change is a major driver of investment returns, creating durable excess profits and long-term winners and losers.

""Changes in the water and agriculture sectors - to supply and demand, global trade, prices and technology - suggest they could be fertile ground for active investment for years to come.""

Alternative asset classes have become increasingly popular with buyers in the retail space seeking to diversify from other more correlated asset classes.

15-11-11,When to buy Volkswagen (VLKAY)...?,"So, I've been thinking for a while there is going to be a very nice time to start buying Volkswagen Stock.  It has to go up eventually.  
  It has to hit bottom soon right, then there would be a great opportunity to buy in.  If their biggest issue is that their cars aren't very efficient, other than the fines, they should be fine... right?

15-11-11,BGMD ER PLAY Update.,"**EDIT** NO 10q yet but BGMD has announced an 8:30am EST CC on Tuesday the 17th.
-

According to several sources on Twitter BGMD's 10q will be filed after hours today or early tomorrow before market open.  However there is nothing on BGMD's home page so that can't be guaranteed.

On the last 10q BGMD had about 110k cash but after the quarter did an offering so their cash on hand will be at LEAST 2m after allowing for burn.

Abbott began selling BGMD's automated test widespread in July (and Galectin-3 is on Abbott Lab's home page so it's being featured and pushed).   However those ramp up sales will not appear on BGMD's ER until Q4 (February 10q).   This ER was expected to be disappointing.

However in reviewing BGMD's august filings, on August 17th in the 10qa on Exhibit 10.6, there was an amended sales agreement with ABT.  In Section 3.1 (b) there is a sentence which says ABT shall pay to BGMD a ""product fee"" on conclusion of the renegotiation.   This paragraph had three tiers and its speculated the fee is based on sales from 2013, 2014, and 2015 (Sales which had been hidden behind a ""test rebate"").

This agreement was signed in May.   ABT pays within 60 days of the end of BGMD's quarter which would have made this payment show up between July 1 and August 30.    BGMD likely did not PR or otherwise tout this because this agreement is under a CTO and doing so would divulge information which had been blacked out.

We don't know what that product fee will be.   It could be $1 or it could be $20m.   We do know this product fee is ""one time"" and we do know this product fee, although based on sales, is for rights, patents, and licenses.   So I personally don't believe it will be $1.  The product fee has to be at least $4m to support today's .60ish trading range.

When the ER is released just take BGMD's cash on hand column and divide it by 10m (the rough number of outstanding shares) and that's the cash value of the company.   The price should either rise toward that number if it's higher than today's share price, or fall if that number is lower.

There is a back-up plan if this play fails.   BGMD still expects an FDA decision that is 10x more valuable than their current FDA approval by the end of the year.  So if things go south you shouldn't be price locked for very long and if things do go south you may be counting it a blessing come FDA.

I'm posting this info again because the SP has fallen as run-up players have taken their profits.   To me this makes this play a good opportunity again.   I'll post a final update on the play after ER is released.

Good luck to everyone playing the ER!

EDIT: No 10q as of this moment but BGMD has scheduled a Tuesday the 17th CC at 8:30AM.",22

15-11-11,cds in a trust account?,"Hi,

Please go easy on me as this is new territory for me.  A trust account was established for my Mom after the sale of her home, with my sibs and I as trustees.  A fairly large chunk of cash has been sitting there for almost two years losing value because we were afraid to invest it lest her health deteriorate (we had some close calls).

She has thankfully stabilized but she is still at risk and the trust needs to age a bit more than 3 more years more before she is clear of any look back period in the event of her needing a higher level of care.  Our understanding from her attorney is that if she has a problem and gets into a medicaid spend down situation then the trust would need to be liquidated and all the money that had been placed into trust would need to be paid back or she wouldn't be eligible for help with long term care.

The sibs and I can't afford to make up for any deficiency in the event that trust investments suffer loss so it has been decreed that only safe investment options may be considered.  This pretty much leaves me with an online savings account (If I can find one that offers a trust account) or CDs either via the brokerage where the cash currently sits, or directly with a bank (again subject to whether they offer a trust account).

I realize rates are crap, but crap is better than losing money which is what is happening.  Also whatever meager interest is earned would come out of the trust without penalty for her to live on.

I'm currently investigating the best way to ladder CDs to maximize return.  I'd probably have to go up to a 3-5 year CD to generate enough return to defray inflation.   However there is still the possibility that they'd need to be sold prior to maturity, either for living expenses or medical emergency.  

Should that happen I know that if the CDs were purchased via the brokerage, they would then need to be sold on the secondary market, which seems like a big unknown and could result in loss of principal.  If there is a chance of needing an early redemption is one better off just purchasing from a bank whereby the penalty should be knowable prior to purchase?

Also if anyone wants to suggest an alternative plan, I'm all ears  :)

Thanks!",2

15-11-12,Has Apple Become A Trading Stock?,"One of the better known aphorisms of 2015 is Jim Cramer's statement that ""Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is not a stock you trade, it's a stock you own.""

Is it? Over the last year, Apple is up 7.12%. Add in the dividend and you get a total yield of 9%. That doesn't sound too bad, except the gain in the NASDAQ over the last year comes to 9.73%. Your Apple stock is trailing the market average.

Then, look at the pattern in Apple shares. While it generally moves in line with the market, the world's biggest company by market cap does so in an exaggerated fashion. While the averages were eking out modest gains early this year, Apple was on fire, rising several times to over $130/share. When the slump hit in August, Apple took it harder than the averages, dropping over $30/share in slightly more than a month. It has recovered since, but currently sits about 10% below its high for the year.

After two years of experiments with failed diamond-growing reactors, Roscheisen's team says it cracked the code. Now the company claims to be able to grow hundreds of diamonds that are up to nine carats in just two weeks in a lab.

The breakthrough was enough to convince ten billionaires and members of Silicon Valley tech royalty to invest.

Diamond Foundry has closed three rounds of financing from individuals including actor Leonardo DiCaprio, Twitter/Medium founder Evan Williams, Zynga founder Mark Pincus, One Kings Lane cofounder Alison Pincus, SUN Microsystems founder Andreas Bechtolsheim, Facebook cofounder Andrew McCollum, former Facebook COO Owen van Natta, Marc Benioff's private-investment manager Mark Goldstein, Sequoia Capital's David Spector, former eBay President Jeff Skoll, Scott Banister, Vast Ventures, and many others.",563

15-11-12,"The case for MEET: Undervalued, continued growth.","MEET

Let's talk fundamentals first, especially regarding the last Q report. They are doing fucking amazing. There is one reason why it's aggregate 'score' missed some easy to read positives: write off of an account. I would like to discount that and point out these positives:

Q3 revenue up 23% y/y!
greater than 10% in daily mobile users y/y!
Revenue up 50% in just 6 months since changing its advertising strategy!
Surprise earnings estimate of 0.09! 50% greater than the estimate!
Forecasting continued user growth = continued revenues. 
And it's trading under 3$. 
It's undervalued in it's industry.
Speaking of industry, it is HUGELY OUTPERFORMING ITS PEERS. In it's industry, MEET is leading in Quarterly, 6 month, and monthly performance. It is playing second fiddle in yearly and YTD performance (which is still a shocking 66% and 91%, respectively). 
Most recent analyst (if you care about them) ratings (Oct. 15) price target of 4$. 

Looking at the technical charts, it closed yesterday 2.92. It's been blowing past resistance like crazy, ever since it GU on Oct. 7th. Previously, the avg. daily volume was 100k. It's now over 1.2 million avg daily volume. 

Just taking the technical indicators of price and volume (which, to me, are the most important) the increase in price is confirmed by the increase in volume. 

It's a traders dream stock. We'll see today if it blows past the 3$ resistance point!

I do have a small, but long position with MEET.

15-11-11,Are we heading into the major correction in tech stocks and valuations everyone has been waiting for ...,"Over the last few months, signs of a correction in tech valuations have been increasing and there seems to be a solid cycle of negative reporting. In the emails leaked during the Sony hack, Evan Spiegel at Snapchat spoke about the triggers for a large scale correction. He said:

""VC dollars are being spent on user acquisition despite unknown LTV of users – a recipe for disaster. This props up Facebook share price and continues to justify VC investment in technology products based on abnormally large mkt cap companies (i.e. “If this company attracts just 5% of users that FB has, it will be HUGE” – fuels spend on user acquisition as user growth is tied to values). When the market for tech stocks cools, Facebook market cap will plummet, access to capital for unproven businesses will become inaccessible, and ad spend on user acquisition will rapidly decrease – compounding problems for Facebook and driving stock even lower.""

This is one business that would be affected but if you see it replicated on other tech businesses that are yet to solidify their revenue model or prove that they have a sustainably growing audience that can be monetised (even if not immediately), then the flow on would be massive for the sector.

Yesterday, I was reading about the increasingly strict ratchets being applied from VCs during funding rounds - the Square IPO is an interesting example (read more here: http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/10/squares-s-1-of-ratchets-and-unicorn-valuations/). This possibly shows an increasing nervousness on the ability to get a return from startups and the VCs are no longer in a FOMO mindset but rather one of involvement with protection.

Finally, Michael Wolff's 'Television is the new Television' makes some really solid arguments around the declining value of CPMs in digital media (which underpins a lot of online businesses) and the increasing cost of audience acquisition. This ties back into Spiegel's point - digital businesses are spending a lot of money on audience channels they don't own to increase their UB, user sessions or whatever the metric of success they have chosen is, and if the value of that audience falls below the cost of acquiring it, the business falls apart.

It feels like a lot of the heat in the industry is dissipating, more rational thought being put into the values (Evan Williams' old quote about 'no one with 200mm users going broke' may not be so accurate anymore) and the time might be right to pull out of the sector, wait for the collapse and look for the companies left which have the ability to resurrect.

Full disclosure - I bought a decent position today and will buy tomorrow.

There have been some decent DD posts on SGNL, search the sub to get acquainted and then do your own DD.

The 2 opportunities you are loading up for:

- Earnings report (within a week)
- Announcement of brand new product (soon, mentioned at last conference)

The company is real, operating, has good IP and is getting their flagship product MyPRS marketed into the general medical community.  Their revenue is still negative and I expect it to be negative on the upcoming ER.  They have built major revenue streams and their assays are reaching ~100M potential patients.  There could be a decent surprise in their Q3 results if adoption was quicker than expected.

I estimate they will announce that cash on hand puts them into the $1.20-$1.30 per share range.

Anyway, I think that this is the best upswing potential stock of the next 2 weeks, so I've jumped back in.  

This stock is VOLATILE- no really, please look at the trading of the last few PRs  before you buy.  You need to set your triggers or watch this puppy.

Targets?  I hate target prices because it is usually a split second situation thing...

I will probably start exiting at $1.2 and watch the momentum closely.  A good ER and some updates and this thing can reach $2, especially if it gets any institutional love.

I read the news two days ago regarding a potential merger between Norfolk Southern and Canadian Pacific.  There are a few things that im reading and seeing that i understand a few that i dont, im hoping you can help.

First - Let me explain what i understand - i understand the market caps of both companies and understand that CP would need to raise a tremendous amount of capital to make this purchase.  I also understand about the regulator hurdles that would be necessary for a merger of this type - the STB (which seems to not like mergers), the canadian governement, etc...  

So - with the negatives out of the way - the most prudent question is - does a deal get done?  Analysts dont seem to think it will but the news is persisting and the stock gains for NS seem to be remaining.  

So let me now go to the things i dont understand - CP seems to have lost all the gains they made in their one day stock jump (went up 5.7% - lost 1.5% yesterday and down over 3% today) while NS has held on to all of their gains on their one day jump monday.  Im wondering why this is.  if people were quick to jump on the merger news why are they now shedding the CP stock?  Was NS's stock simply undervalued and needed a kick in the butt to get up to where it should be?  Im reading that should a merger go through NS stock would be valued at about $95 a share, would it be smart to get in on it even at $88 now?  

how speculative is the buying?  im trying to find a good mix of analysts that might be able to explain the likelihood of this merger and whether it would be good to invest now on the ground floor so to speak?",3

15-11-12,Is a Subway franchise a good investment for me?,"Hello, Reddit! So here's my deal... I work in sales and make pretty decent money (~6 figures) and our company is dumping the portfolios, so I am about to get a decent chunk of change for my part of it. (about $65k before taxes) I plan on putting some away for taxes when April comes, but the rest I want to invest.

Stocks aren't really for me, I want something that I can work on and grow and feel like I'm building a business. For a while I thought about investing in real estate, buying a rental property or two (on loans so putting 20% down) but the return isn't really that great, and if I want to be seriously rich I don't think real estate will do it for me with my small amount of capital. 
This made me start thinking that I should open a business with the money.
Now, for my regular job I work largely with small businesses, and I realize that like 90% of them aren't even making a profit. Plus, I want something that I wouldn't have to work at full time since I'd like to keep my job since I would likely make more money per hour working that than running a small business.

This brought me to researching franchises, since they are arguably a lower risk than starting your own business from scratch, and they often help you set everything up. After researching, I've decided Subway would probably be the best option for me. The franchise fees are in my price range, and I personally eat at Subway all the time.
Now, I am young and don't really know anyone right now that knows anything about running QSRs or franchises, so I have a lot of questions.
 I am aware that all of it is very dependent on location and whatnot, but realistically if I picked a good location and everything went smoothly, how likely would it be that I would be able to get away with spending less than 10 hours per week at the store? Is that even possible or am I dreaming? Ideally I'd like to keep working my job full time and then after hours and on weekends tend to the store.

I live in the Boise, ID area so rent and cost of living is very good here. How much should I expect to spend as my initial investment? And after researching, there are so many mixed reviews about Subways being a bad company and other saying it's great and hard to fail. I understand that there is great risk in any business/investment but the more I can understand about it the better I can make informed decisions. 
If I go for it, I plan on taking all the profit and putting it into more Subways and so forth. Also, one of my good friends and coworkers is also about to be getting the same amount of money and I could potentially partner with him.

Thank you so much for reading! ANY help or advice AT ALL woud be greatly appreciated. Even if you're just telling me I'm crazy and shouldn't do it, I'm posting here because I want to hear what you have to say about it.",8

We already own one property and whilst we've found the experience to be okay so far, it's something we'd like to avoid in the future just because there's lots of potential for hassle or problems.

As a result we're looking at REITs instead, particularly:

* [iShares UK Property UCITS ETF](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251802/ishares-uk-property-ucits-etf)
* [Vanguard REIT Index Fund](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0123&amp;FundIntExt=INT)

15-11-12,I have more than a gut feeling the crude oil industry is about to take a big tumble. Please hear me out.,"Full disclosure, I am not an investor, I am a fan. I have never invested in my life and I won't be able to until after I graduate this May to work in an unrelated field. I apologize if my terminology or lack of specificity comes across as ignorance because that very well may be the case.

Anyway, the reason I have created this post is because I have gotten a little excited at the idea that I may have predicted the next big show on Wall st days in advance. I may be connecting dots that do not exist, but I urge you to hear me out:

The XOI index has been at somewhat of a decline since June 2014. Notably, there is a dip in late August of this year and again in late September when the stock dips close to $1,000:

http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=%5EXOI+Interactive#{""range"":""2y"",""allowChartStacking"":true}

The dip in August was largely due to Saudi Arabia essentially turning up the faucet in order to prove their production capabilities amidst concerns the US would proceed with Keystone. The stock dips again in September however somehow holds despite the fact the Saudis have essentially shown their hand/confirmed what everyone is accepting more and more -- there is simply too much supply and not enough demand for the markets to ever return to their former glory. 

Now imagine an *AWESOME* party that has been raging for a good while and it's full of all the medium and large oil companies and everybody is watching events unfold just as we are. 

The poorer companies and less attractive companies in the market would be wise to immediately go over and start flirting with one of the prettier and rich ones. The party is going to be over in a bit and once the lights turn on you really want to find somebody cute. It was a nice party and lets face it, you're horny but a bit ugly. 

Now consider the IMF report for this October:

https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfsr/

The IMF basically indicates not so subtly that the markets are a bit sensitive this holiday season. Citing liquidity, there is a bit of conjecture as to the global markets and their stability:

""... as well as the implications of low liquidity. Currently, market liquidity is being supported by benign cyclical conditions.""

My gut is tells me that this party is getting more interesting right now considering the IMF announcements that liquidity is low yet Shell and others have gone on and on about selling Arctic assets in search for ""more profitable methods"" (oh and also firing a few nonessential employees):

http://www.ogfj.com/mergers-acquisitions.html
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-172097/Shell-workforce-learn-fate.html

Right about now the cute companies such as BP which just dropped some weight are just hanging out by the bar and letting companies like Chesapeake and Devon flash their junk while whispering ""merger me"" in the sultriest tone possible to drop dead beautiful *cough* rich *cough* 10/10 companies like Exxon and PetroChina.

Once the first couple mergers happen the lights will turn on and it will be time for everyone to leave. Find a date or cease to exist - basic survival of the fittest because the oil party is actually over for small to medium sized companies. Lucky for them these rich companies don't mind the occasional acquisition, especially if someone is desperate enough.

Problem is all eyes on the room are on the drop dead companies and everybody has a smartphone. Nobody wants to cause buy anything because they are expecting prices to drop when the lights turn on and everyone looks pretty ugly. Once the lights turn on it is socially acceptable for Chevron/BP/Exxon to ask a couple mediocre looking companies for a threeway without even batting an eye. 

I look at these companies and I picture googly eyed 5's and 6's all trying to flirt with shitty pickup lines and a bit of a coke addiction. That's just my two cents.

Rather, it's a straightforward approach to deals.

He continued: ""The best investments are the easiest ones to approve. Ironically, when a bunch of very smart people are sitting around a table for hours trying to figure out whether they should do something, that tends to not necessarily lead to the best results.""

"" The investments where people walk in and the sense is, ‘well, this looks absolutely terrific, let’s do it,’ those investments are almost always quite successful.""

It has been a wild ride and people have been jumping off the roller coaster. Hell, I should have too a long time ago when the hype train was in full motion, but it crashed and now it is undervalued. 

But savantness, the solar market is going down!!!

Oh really you mean it doesn't have record breaking growth? http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-data

And PV installation cost is decreasing dramatically while we're at it. 

Not to mention, Solar Edge Technologies isn't a true solar company. They help existing solar installations by adding efficiency with power optimizers and inverters. They also have a new product that begins selling next quarter that has 99% efficiency. This premium product will drive margin up.

They also recently built an automated manufacturing plant that will cut COGS significantly. 

BUT BUT BUT Enphase said that the demand was weakening for these modules!!

NO. They just got a lot of their market share taken by $SEDG and are bitching about it. SEDG increased guidance for the next few quarters as well. If demand was weakening they would have disclosed it and their guidance would have gone down.

I'm a big FUNdamentals guy so lets look at this shit:

P/E: 19
Forward P/E: 8
PEG: .81

0 fucking debt. 0. 

Go check: http://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=sedg
There is nothing wrong with it fundamentally, enormous growth, the only flag is crazy volatility. 

They're going to kill earnings AGAIN next quarter too. This is getting ridiculous. The disrespect for this stock is absurd.

Elon Musk is pro solar too, Solar City is about 20% of their business, and they are quickly shrinking that to not rely on this company. 

TLDR: Solar is still going, $SEDG is undervalued. 

Full disclosure: I am not a CFA or any of that. I also closed my positions earlier on the earnings spike. I am thinking about getting in when the dive settles down. Don't try to catch a falling knife unless you're going long.

15-11-12,BNS - Another good trade buy low sell high!,"https://www.tradingview.com/x/auwHi518/
This chart was made a few months ago as well. 

Dividend rate if reduced to 0.45 from 0.53, is still around 4%. 

If you use 5% to 10% of your portfolio for this play, for me its 5k. I will be dividing this 5k  over 5 entry points, but I will do 6 to be safe, which is about $830 per entry point. 

pt1 @45 = 17 shares
pt2 @39 = 20
pt3 @ 35 = 22
pt4 @30 = 26
pt5 @ 25 = 32
pt6 @20 = 40

Total shares= 157 shares @ average share price of approx 32. 
Dividend at this rate is around 5%, IF they lower their dividend rate. Otherwise, you have 6.6%. Pretty decent for a large bank and one of the big 6 in Canada. 

So what's next?Next step is to convert it to a covered call position or just keep accumulating dividends until you reach a reasonable gain. If it does drop to $20, I would at least expect it to rebound to 30-35 range. If that is the case, you would have gained a solid 4-6% in dividends over that time frame before breaking even.  It's not sexy, but its pretty deez IMO.

15-11-12,State of the Market: Completely Insane,"This market is 100% crazy stupid.  Anyone who thinks otherwise doesn’t understand the history of valuations and their effect on returns and doesn’t care about protecting their capital long term.  Yes, the current P/E is not as bad as other valuation metrics, but P/E ratio is one of the least reliable valuation metrics because of how short term oriented it is.

The most reliable long term valuation metric is the stock market to GDP ratio, which Warren Buffett often refers to as the “single most reliable measure of stock market valuation at any given time.”  As of today, the future projected returns are projected to be 1% per year INCLUDING dividends. This means that taking dividends out, you would have to subtract 2% per year, roughly, from the total returns. How accurate is it?  When looking at past results, it is 92% accurate and the times it deviates is when the future returns only deviate because of massive overvaluation extremes, like now, or undervalued extremes such as 1982. 

So first off, if you don’t read above and think that the next 10 years in the stock market are going to be ugly, you need to take all of your money out of the stock market, bury it in the back yard, and remove yourself from society because you’re dense.

Look at the period around 1999/2000…if anyone remembers those times, expectations were of 15-20% returns for the rest of time.  If you don’t believe me, go look up articles from Barrons and other financial organizations and see what was said by “professional” money managers who were considered experts.  The scary part is, we aren’t that far off of that time right now! The annualized return expected over the next 10 years is around 1% per year! WITH DIVIDENDS!! Which is close to what it was back in 1999 and 2000, when expected returns were sub 0% even with dividends, and things played out exactly that way. For valuations today, that means that based on 92% correlation, we should expect the nominal market price of the S&amp;P to be LOWER in 10 years than it is today because taking out dividends takes the nominal price of the S&amp;P growth to negative territory!

Historically, the average stock market to GDP ratio has been in the 90% range and as Warren Buffett says, when you are in the 60-70% range, you will do quite well for the foreseeable future.  However, at the start of past secular bull markets, the ratio has gone as low as 42% before the big rises start, which means that prices are much lower based on history.  Why?  Well think about it…

The most important thing to future returns is how much you pay for an investment today.  Can an investment still do well even if you pay more for it today than you wanted to? Of course.  That happens all the time. I’ve successfully done it in real estate. But when you are investing in a broad base of companies, like any diversified portfolio should be, it will all average out.  So you need to pay as little as possible, as a whole. The less you pay, the more return you will get because over the long run, stocks will perform to their long term valuation levels.  In the short run, it’s a crap shoot.  As Warren Buffett always says “stocks are a voting machine in the short run and a weighing machine in the long run.”  Which means that in the short run, the popular ones will do the best but in the long run, the fundamentals of cash and cash flow and revenue will be what determines success.

So in 1982, when the stock market to GDP ratio was around 42%, it would make sense that the following 18 years yielded 18% returns and when the stock market to GDP ratio was north of 1.5, as it is today, the following ten years produced very poor results.   Paying a higher price for anything will always take away future returns because returns are calculated on what you PAY for an investment.  The results will factor into your return as well, don’t get me wrong, but the income and cash flow are not at all affected by what you pay for the investment. They will be what they will be whether you pay $1 or $1MM for it.

10 Year Cyclically Adjust P/E Ratio

This was created many decades ago (earlier part of the 20th century) by the writers of Security Analysis, which is the Bible of value investing.  We all know that P/E is the price to earnings ratio and it can be applied to the market.  However, these guys understood that any given year can have massive fluctuations based on short term expenses or revenue gains that aren’t reflective of long term performance.  So what they did was even it out a bit by taking the present value of the previous 10 years of earnings and see where the market stood.  The historical average is around 16.6, and CURRENTLY we are at 27.  27! The only other time in HISTORY that it has been higher was 1999/2000.  In fact, all previous secular bear markets prior to 1999 started when the S&amp;P 10 year P/E was around 23-25! So we are even higher than what starts a 17-20 year flat stock market.

In past secular bull markets, the S&amp;P 10 Year P/E is in the single digits.  Usually around 6-9 so in this situation, for us to get to that level again, we would need the S&amp;P to go from 2100 today down to 700.  I know it sounds unfathomable but that’s where it would need to be to have the 10 year P/E at 9.  Is it a coincidence that when valuations are high, future returns are low and when valuations are low, future returns are high? Of course not.  Go back up and read my statements on paying more for an investment will always chip at your returns.  100% of the time.

I love watching CNBC and having all these pundits and experts talk about how we are in the early stages of a long term secular bull market.  Liz Ann Sonders is one person I love to pick on because she is the Chief Investment Officer at Charles Schwab and she should know much better.  But she doesn’t.  She doesn’t look at history just like 99.9% of the average person.  So pat yourself on the back for being just as smart as Liz Ann Sonders.

Valuations will ALWAYS mark the end and start of secular bear and bull markets.  Always. Remember, the less you pay for something, the better your return will be.  When valuations are low, you are paying less and therefore, your long term return will be higher.  So long term secular bull markets will ONLY begin when valuations are low.  How low?  Well below historical averages, that’s for sure.  And secular bear markets will begin when valuations are high.  How high? Higher than the long term average.

Remember, the average is the average but we are never at the average point.  We are always either overvalued or undervalued.  Never at fair value. (I say never but really what I mean is for a sustainable period of time…) So we talked about the historical average of 16.6 on the 10 year P/E, but how often are we actually there? 

GuruFocus.com says the current 10 year P/E is 25.5, which I won’t argue. Close enough to 27.  But if you look at the data, the average they have is the 16.6 that I mentioned above.  But how often did we actually hit that?  Very rarely! And we were never there for long.  So as you can see, stock valuations are never really at fair value for long enough to matter.  We are either over or under value at all times.  So you have to decide: are you going to be a buyer or seller at any given point?  Now, do I make my investing decisions based on this?  No. You can find good buys at high valuations and bad buys at good valuations.  But if I am buying broad based funds, then this would elicit some caution at the extreme levels.

BTW, interesting enough, look at when stocks were at their highest valuation peaks…1900, 1929, 1966, 2000, and today…what did stocks do after those levels?  See below…

In 1900, the S&amp;P was at the equivalent of 7.5 or so.  At this point, the 10 year P/E was around 22.  For the next 24 years, the S&amp;P fluctuated between 7 and 10 continuously until the late 1920s boom took things to the next peak/bubble.  Coincidence?  If you think so, you’re smarter than me.

In 1929, the S&amp;P 10 year P/E got to 27. The nominal price of the S&amp;P at that time was 25 or so.  So what happened after that?  The S&amp;P dropped down as low as 7 and didn’t recover to its previous high of 25 until 1952! It took 23 years for the market to hit the same level again. Again…coincidence?  Come on…let’s go to the next extreme…

In 1966, the S&amp;P 10 year P/E hit 24 and the S&amp;P’s nominal price was around 100.  So what happened from there? For the next 16 years, the S&amp;P went sideways and stayed at or below that level until 1982…which was the start of the biggest bull market run in history.

Now for the biggest market extreme ever…1999/2000.  The S&amp;P 10 year P/E got as high as 44 and since then, we have seen new highs…all the way up to 2100 as of late, but the S&amp;P also got as low as 666 and based on valuations, the only reason stocks are so high up right now is that they are at high valuation peaks…so this is not meant to show that paying a high premium is ok.  It is not.  We are going to have a bad stock market for the coming 10-12 years.  History has shown it going back to 1871..why would it be different now? It’s not.  It never is.  Yes, stocks can go higher and higher for a long period of time and irrationally, but it eventually stops.  The music stops.  And suddenly the chairs disappears…

Individual Stocks

Anyone who reads this has seen me short Amazon.  Well, I’ve been killed on it.  And guess what…I’m not worried.  Amazon officially is the most expensive stock, valuation based, in the stock market.  Granted, that’s based on P/E and we all know that P/E can fluctuate wildly but either way, it’s overpriced.  When other companies such as Wal-Mart and Target sell for 0.5 or 0.8 times revenue, Amazon is selling for 3 times revenue.  When other companies are selling for 3-5 times book value, Amazon is selling for 28 times book.  There is no valuation metric that shows Amazon is a good deal.  It has more than doubled in stock price this year alone.

No one cares about valuations during bull markets.  Look at private venture tech companies.  We have never had more “unicorns” (private start ups that are valued over $1Billion) ever in our history.  Including 1999/2000, the most overpriced tech market we have ever had!

The scary part, for investors, should be that Square just announced they are going public for 33% LESS than their last round of private valuation! Less! That’s not good.  They raised money at a $6Billion valuation recently but are now going public based on a $4Billion valuation.

Back in 1999/2000, the only positive of the market was that smaller companies didn’t have bad valuations.  The horrible valuations were on the higher end value of companies.  Today, we are seeing it on all levels, but also high end value companies are seeing larger than life valuations.  Yahoo, Facebook, Amazon, Adobe, etc…these companies have been around for a while and are still sporting very high valuations! As I write this, some douche from Edward Jones named Aaron is saying that he has Amazon as a strong buy because of robust growth and stronger margins.  Meanwhile, he also says he values Amazon’s retail business at 2.5 times revenue….WTF?!?!

Here is why I am confused.  Amazon has worse margins on their retail portion than Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart sells for 0.5 times earnings but he decides to put 2.5 times margin on there?!?! Why?!?! Why not 3 times? Why not 4? 5? 6? Just saying a number when the average is a lot lower is insane…of the 81 consumer companies on the S&amp;P 500, the average price to sales ratio CURRENTLY in this massively overpriced market is 1.8 times earnings and the average gross margins is 40% and Amazon’s, on their retail side, is 24%.  Wait, so they are 40% lower on margins and they are worth a premium to sales?  Does that even make sense?  yes, it is growing but as it has grown it’s margins have decreased and the majority of their better margins are coming from AWS, it’s cloud computing services which is a commodity.  It will be a price war. Margins will shrink because the costs to operate are pennies. Google and Microsoft are already in it and growing their portions like crazy.

Another example: Tesla.  Tesla is a great company. Their product rocks.  They’re the new hot thing.  But what’s it worth to us?  So typically, car companies sell for the following:

Ford: 0.38 times sales

GM: 0.39 times sales

Honda: 0.48 times sales

Toyota: 0.83 times sales

Daimler: 0.54 times sales

Are we seeing a pattern yet?

Tesla: 7.1 times sales.

WTF?!?!? Why?!?! Yes, they are cool. Yes, their cars are awesome. But they make no money! Yes, they are trying to grow, but something has to give!! Yes, their gross profit margin is much better than Ford and GM, but it’s not THAT much better than Daimler, Honda, and Toyota, who all sport around 22% margin and Tesla has a bit over 24% margin! So what gives?!?! It doesn’t add up at all. But it’s a sexy and fun company and so everyone will pay whatever they can to get it.

What is the Right Price?

When I go back to my high school, the first thing I do is take my iPhone out and say “Who here has this kind of phone and loves it?”  Sure enough, over half the class raises their hand? So I then asks the students “would you pay $1 for this phone?” And of course, they say “of course we would.”  No duh.  Then I ask “Would you pay $1Million for this phone?”  And of course they say “no way.”  Again…duh.

But that’s what it seems is what happens with stocks like Amazon, FaceBook, Tesla, etc….people say the product or company is awesome so pay whatever it takes to own it.  You may say I am wrong about this, but I’m not.  Why is 7.1 times sales ok for Tesla when similar companies are getting 0.8 times sales, at best?  Why is 3 times sales ok for Amazon when similar companies are selling for 0.5 times sales?

This is a prime example of a bubbling market.  There are massive overvaluations across the board and margins are high because of lower interest costs because of the Fed reducing rates so aggressively over the past 6 years and keeping them low.  When corporate debt interest charges are down 80%, of course you earnings on the same revenue will increase but it doesn’t mean you’re a better company because of it.

If you think about investments the same way I thought about the iPhone, you will realize that there is a price for EVERYTHING.  It doesn’t matter what it is. You can buy a pile of dog shit for the right price as long as you can figure out a way to make something on it.  There is always a price for something.  When Long Term Capital Management went under and rocked the financial world in 1997, Warren Buffett made an offer to buy the very assets that took the company down.  So the same assets that took a company down had gone down in price enough that it was attractive enough for Buffett to make an offer on it. That is a prime example of how prices are what dictates the returns.

Recap

It’s hard to see the market go up and read something above. I get it.  I’m not here to argue that the market can’t go up higher because it can.  And it probably will.  Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.  Look at Japan.  Those markets have been irrational for decades.

But at the end of the day, valuations do matter. And anyone who thinks that buying today will yield good results long term has another thing coming.  It may not happen this year, but it will happen eventually.  People have to give up on stocks for stock prices to go to the point where they are a great buy again. Literally they need to be saying “if you want to retire well, do not buy stocks.” Just like in 2009 when the world fell apart and in that same year in real estate.  People have to give up.

Peter Lynch has an anecdote he has told many times.  He talks about how he knows when to buy or sell stocks.  When he goes to a cocktail party and people are telling HIM what to buy, he knows it’s time to sell.  When he goes to the cocktail party and people are feeling bad for him for being a money manager, he knows it’s a good time to buy.  People think you MUST own stocks and that’s when things get crazy.  Prices have to drop and prices only drop when people don’t want something anymore.

There will be a tipping point soon.  Just like it was mortgage backed securities in 2008.  That isn’t what caused markets to crash, it is just what caused markets to care about valuation suddenly.  The tipping point is something we don’t know or see yet, probably.  But when it happens, everyone will blame this one thing and then later say they saw it happening.  So many people now say “it was so obvious that real estate was overpriced back in 2008.”  Oh was it?  Hmm.  It’s ego on my part because I have 3 years of blog posts showing my views on the market and so far I have been “wrong.”

When this market does take a turn, for us to get to the point of starting a real secular bull market, we have to get to an ugly place.  Years and years of bad returns.  People have to give up.  We aren’t anywhere near that now.  Even 2008 and 2009 wasn’t that bad.  I think in the last 12 years, we have have 11 of them be up years.  That’s unreal.  It shows you how short and quick the last drop was. You don’t lose faith in markets when it’s a quick pop and then rebound.  We need a long term drudging.  It will eventually happen…but I just don’t know when.",0

There's been a used car that I've had my eye on for quite some time, and so I've been planning on achieving the funds in approximately 2-3 years to purchase that car.

The financial plan I've developed on my own has been to set aside $600/mo for investing in mutual funds through a reputable company - perhaps Wells Fargo - for 24-36 months. I know about the basics of mutual funds through various business classes in high school and a little bit about my intro business class, however I still have a few questions.

* Is investing in the stock market via mutual funds for only 2-3 years worth the risk? (there could be a down year in that time period, which may not make the investment worth it?)
* Will there be a brokerage fee? If so, is that fee typically through a percentage or a flat fee? (Yes, I understand that I could do my own investing via a dynamic portfolio but I'd rather rely on an expert!)
* What makes a great mutual fund to invest into? (great return percentage over x amount of years?)

I hold no position in BGMD but could potentially in the future. I will be mathing and you should not trust any of my numbers as I damn well could have fucked up. If I did fuck up, let me know so I can correct shit. I do not want to spread misinformation.

---------------
So the current BGMD play is what product fee will they be receiving Q3 and how will that affect the cash/share price. If you want to get caught up on the product fee check out the DD by /u/pcx99 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3rje30/attention_plebs_this_is_a_genuine_stock_tip_the/). Time for the math...

---------------
At the end of 2Q'15 BGMD had $178k on hand and zero debt. They did some warrant financing and expect to receive about $2.1M from that which will also bring their total shares up to 10842638 [source](http://investor.bg-medicine.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=927561). Their average revenue the last three quarters was about $500k and their average operating costs the last three quarters was about $1.8M (It's dangerous using averages like this but it I'm doing it anyways). If we math all this up we get:
&gt;178000+2100000+500000-1800000=**$978,000**

So we can estimate pre product fee cash/share price of:
&gt;978000/10842638=**$.09**

It does not look good without that product fee. The following table shows total cash estimates based on different product fees and the associated cash/share price:

Fee (millions)|Total Cash|Cash/Share Price
:--|:--|:--
0|$978,000.00|$0.09

25|$25,978,000.00|$2.40

---------------
Wow, math is fucking fun. So, what does all this mean? It means that if you believe in the product fee play, try to estimate what you think the fee will be. This is really fucking hard but it's up to you to form an opinion on that. Look at the row for your product fee and check the cash/share price. That is quite possibly where the share price will drift towards if you are correct (NOT GUARANTEED).

---------------
Final warning, don't take these numbers as gospel. Check the numbers many times before you make a play.

For example, in that Schwab article, they glaze over the huge 2000-2002 downturn (part of the study period) and the 2007-2009 downturn (not part of the study period) and don't give context about what happened in 1955-1974 (holding cash outperformed all investment strategies). There's also the issue of survivorship bias. Obviously, they are trying to sell their services, so I can see why they would bias the article.

15-11-13,"Just for fun, I sent an email to Anavex contracted IR.","I have known about Anavex since it was pumped on a Yahoo messageboard I frequented in April or something like that (trading at $.45 a share or $1.80 post-split), and wanted to buy in before the partial 2a data. I even put it on my phone's calendar but ironically forgot to set a reminder alarm. Anyway, I didn't buy in. 

* I had previously sent an email to Anavex months ago asking them to reveal individual patient data of their partial 2a results, but they didn't.

* Last week, after hearing that Anavex was planning to release data on Monday instead of at the same time as the conference on Saturday, I sent an email that this would violate Regulation FD. I received a reply (after the abstract had been leaked and then officially provided by Anavex later) that ""as stated in yesterday’s press release, “a press release with the results will be issued before the market open on Monday, November 9, 2015. The CTAD presentation will also be made available on the Anavex website.”"".
I half-assumed this meant they would release the results on Saturday on their site at the same time, but they of course didn't.

The data is not really that bad and debatably promising, if it were not for the ridiculous number of red flags. So I sent an email on 11/12 (yesterday). Will update you guys if I hear anything!

---------------

Hello,

I have a request for Anavex management: while I appreciate that there is high variability in MMSE and other scores, data is missing, such as the 95% +- range, as well as subanalyses of the arms of the current trial. Without such data it is not difficult to accuse you of cherry-picking. You will put to rest these doubts if you release all individual patient scores in raw format. You are not the only ones who can run statistical analysis, you know!

I believe that releasing this data will provide strong confidence not just in me but the investing community at large -- of the veracity of your perhaps overly optimistic statements about signs of efficacy, especially given the current cloud of suspicion following Dr. MacFarlane's overoptimism in the Prana trials, and Mr. Missling's eagerness to be interviewed multiple times by what can only be characterized as penny pumping websites and Anavex's violation of Regulation FD due to the fact that you did not provide Nov. 7 data on Nov. 7 but instead two days later.

The bashing regarding promotional activity that is not probably tired to Anavex aside, these other concerns are real and not going away without conclusive evidence to the contrary.

Thank you,
ME.",1

I watched this company and its message boards for a while, never quite getting the nerve to pull the trigger and start a position.  Then one morning just before the market opened, I noticed a post that said Timbaland had come on board as a partner.  I quickly bought at the open.  My initial investment is up ~230%.  The CEO actually gives updates on a message board I frequent, and I decided to average up significantly.  That portion of my position is up ~30%.  

There have been hints that news is coming for a while, but nothing definite.  The company is looking to do a product launch nationally and has been hinting at it for a while.  Today the CEO posted that we could expect news next week.

I'm usually very skeptical of companies and their promises on the OTC, but this CEO has avoided any fluff and seems to be a straight shooter.

Now, this is where things get really weird. Denmark's Finance Minister Karsten Lauritzen went on TV (links to original Danish source using Google Translate to English) saying he was notified of the 2,500 registrations, and that this seemed to constitute an evasion of the rules establishing tax exemptions for EVs.

According to the source, the Finance Minister also pointed out that such hoarding to resell the cars at the higher tax levels is illegal.

According to the news, Tesla denied having registered that number of cars, but obviously Tesla can be formally true and just be claiming that someone else (a third party) did as much - that wouldn't make it legal as it would still be hoarding to skirt the tax increases.",1

15-11-13,Cake-day DD -- BNHLF — OTC .60 — (50%-150% 3 month play),"**MARKED CLOSED, PARTIAL SUCCESS** 

The FDA advisory committee [Recomended against proving BNHLF's Drug](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/telesta-therapeutics-announces-results-fda-120000620.html) as such playing the FDA becomes a far, far, far riskier proposition.   The FDA does not have to follow the committee's recommendation but at the present time the plays indicated in this DD are VERY, VERY risky.  Since this DD recommended avoiding the committee run-up play, it is being marked partial success since this DD potentially saved some people quite a bit of money.

**MARKED CLOSED, PARTIAL SUCCESS**

-


TL;DR: Very risky 5 day play (just don't do it), very good late December buy-in and hold to February 28th play.

-

**INTRO**

-

Oh Reddit, what penny stock scam have you gotten yourself into now?   So many PM’s asking for BNHLF DD!   I hate DD’ing Canadian companies!  They take 10x the work.   But It’s my birthday (cake day) and I guess I’ll be a karma whore and give you guys what you want!  So do me a solid will you and at least up-vote it if you’ve made it this far!

-

**The Company**

-

Telesta Therapeutics Inc. (BNHLF) is a Canadian company that has one drug: MCNA which attacks bladder cancer.   The company apparently bet the farm on this one drug and it actually appears to have paid off, clearing p3 trials and showing a rather impressive  [25% survival rate](http://www.telestatherapeutics.com/products-pipeline/) (impressive for cancer anyway).   The drug was also shown to be safe and well tolerated with minimal side effects.

-

**The Finances**

-

The company is Canadian so all these figures are in Canadian dollars but it’s safe enough to treat them as US dollars for our purposes.   The company has no real debt save for some government loans, 42m cash on hand and loses 4m a quarter.   That tells us the company can survive with its cash on hand for more than a year so the risk of further dilution is minimal.

-

BHNLF’s real problem is its share count.  It has 227m outstanding shares and 12m in warrants that are in the money over .36.   This stock will slog and wade on a catalyst, it will not jump and the higher the share price, the slower it will move.

-

A staggering 108m of those shares were issued in the middle of august  but they have to be held to the middle of December.   So let me stress this as hard as I possibly can: **BE OUT OF THIS STOCK BEFORE DECEMBER** because in December the floodgates are going to open and those August buyers are going to be looking to take out equity.   If you want to play the FDA look for a re-entry in January or early February.

-

Now the good news.   Their next financial statement should show some new revenues from their Korean licensee.   Also they just signed a contract in October for Ipsen to sell their drug worldwide (save for the Americas mostly) with an up front $10m payment due and future payments of an additional $100m.  So this company’s cash is going up the next time it reports in February.   Since it’s out of clinical trials its expenses are also going to start going down.

-

At today’s closing price of .60 the company has an overall valuation of 144m (US) and a recently signed contract that is pretty much equal to its market valuation, with no chance of dilution, and a pending FDA decision that will allow it to start selling in the states next year.

-

**THE PLAY**

-

Here we’re betting the company will report the FDA advisory committee will recommend approving the drug.  There’s a decent chance of that happening since the FDA tends to clear drugs which have finished clinical trials.   I’d be wary of this play since the stock has already seen a 100% run up in share price in the last month (from the .30s).   However the recent $110m contract makes me a lot more comfortable making this play since there should be no reason for the stock to fall below .50 this month.  In short, you run-up players got REALLY lucky with that contract announce in the ER because it will tend to set a floor from the run-up crash I expect to happen.

-

This play will likely involve stupid run-up games.   It’s safest just to take your profits if any on the 16th or 17th.  Remember this isn’t an FDA decision.  It’s only a recommendation for the FDA to approve the drug in February.   I personally feel that this is not a good risk/reward play.

-

What ever the case, be out of this stock before December.   The equity seeking shares will start pushing this stock down unless they really are true investors waiting for FDA and income.  If you like shorting stocks well I guess this might be a catalyst but you better cover before January and the FDA run-up begins.

-

If you’d like, sometime in December look for an entry point for a long one year hold and you should be pleasantly surprised with the stock’s performance over 12 months.

-

It’s also safest to play the FDA by looking for a December low and holding to the final FDA determination in February.  This is the TRUE play here.   People who start looking for low points in December should be handsomely rewarded come March.

-

Look for an entry in *LATE* December as it appears the 100m share offering can start trading around December 14th.

-

**Catalysts**

-

* November 18, 2015 — Company reports on FDA advisory committee’s recommendation for (or against) approval.   Approval is expected as P3 trials showed good results.  Expect serious run-up games with this catalyst.  This play is VERY high risk.  Expect only a 25% gain from .60 in the days leading up and a drop a day or two before the decision and a steeper drop after.

* February 27th, 2016 — Expected final FDA determination.   From .60 today, this decision should at the very least double the stock price and possibly triple.  With the new $110m revenue contract also kicking in around that month’s ER and additional Korean royalties I’m projecting a price target of between $1.50 and $2 at the very least with the stock continuing to appreciate as it begins selling its drug in the US and collecting royalties on world-wide sales.

-

**The Risks**

-

* FDA — No.
* FDA — We need more information.
* **ONE HUNDRED MILLION SHARES** ready to be sold in December.

-

**DISCLOSURE**

-

I do not have a stake in this company.  I am not a professional trader.  This post should be the start of your due diligence otherwise my mistakes become your own.   This stock may go down.  You may lose money.  You may lose ALL your money.   So make darn sure you know what you’re buying because you are competing with people who do.

Oh Reddit, what penny stock scam have you gotten yourself into now?   So many PM’s asking for BNHLF DD!   I hate DD’ing Canadian companies!  They take 10x the work.   But It’s my birthday (cake day) and I guess I’ll be a karma whore and give you guys what you want!  So do me a solid will you and at least up-vote it if you’ve made it this far!

-

**The Company**

-

Telesta Therapeutics Inc. (BNHLF) is a Canadian company that has one drug: MCNA which attacks bladder cancer.   The company apparently bet the farm on this one drug and it actually appears to have paid off, clearing p3 trials and showing a rather impressive  [25% survival rate](http://www.telestatherapeutics.com/products-pipeline/) (impressive for cancer anyway).   The drug was also shown to be safe and well tolerated with minimal side effects.

-

**The Finances**

-

The company is Canadian so all these figures are in Canadian dollars but it’s safe enough to treat them as US dollars for our purposes.   The company has no real debt save for some government loans, 42m cash on hand and loses 4m a quarter.   That tells us the company can survive with its cash on hand for more than a year so the risk of further dilution is minimal.

-

BHNLF’s real problem is its share count.  It has 227m outstanding shares and 12m in warrants that are in the money over .36.   This stock will slog and wade on a catalyst, it will not jump and the higher the share price, the slower it will move.

-

A staggering 108m of those shares were issued in the middle of august  but they have to be held to the middle of December.   So let me stress this as hard as I possibly can: **BE OUT OF THIS STOCK BEFORE DECEMBER** because in December the floodgates are going to open and those August buyers are going to be looking to take out equity.   If you want to play the FDA look for a re-entry in January or early February.

-

Now the good news.   Their next financial statement should show some new revenues from their Korean licensee.   Also they just signed a contract in October for Ipsen to sell their drug worldwide (save for the Americas mostly) with an up front $10m payment due and future payments of an additional $100m.  So this company’s cash is going up the next time it reports in February.   Since it’s out of clinical trials its expenses are also going to start going down.

-

At today’s closing price of .60 the company has an overall valuation of 144m (US) and a recently signed contract that is pretty much equal to its market valuation, with no chance of dilution, and a pending FDA decision that will allow it to start selling in the states next year.

-

**THE PLAY**

-

Here we’re betting the company will report the FDA advisory committee will recommend approving the drug.  There’s a decent chance of that happening since the FDA tends to clear drugs which have finished clinical trials.   I’d be wary of this play since the stock has already seen a 100% run up in share price in the last month (from the .30s).   However the recent $110m contract makes me a lot more comfortable making this play since there should be no reason for the stock to fall below .50 this month.  In short, you run-up players got REALLY lucky with that contract announce in the ER because it will tend to set a floor from the run-up crash I expect to happen.

-

This play will likely involve stupid run-up games.   It’s safest just to take your profits if any on the 16th or 17th.  Remember this isn’t an FDA decision.  It’s only a recommendation for the FDA to approve the drug in February.   I personally feel that this is not a good risk/reward play.

-

What ever the case, be out of this stock before December.   The equity seeking shares will start pushing this stock down unless they really are true investors waiting for FDA and income.  If you like shorting stocks well I guess this might be a catalyst but you better cover before January and the FDA run-up begins.

-

If you’d like, sometime in December look for an entry point for a long one year hold and you should be pleasantly surprised with the stock’s performance over 12 months.

-

It’s also safest to play the FDA by looking for a December low and holding to the final FDA determination in February.  This is the TRUE play here.   People who start looking for low points in December should be handsomely rewarded come March.

-

Look for an entry in *LATE* December as it appears the 100m share offering can start trading around December 14th.

-

**Catalysts**

-

* November 18, 2015 — Company reports on FDA advisory committee’s recommendation for (or against) approval.   Approval is expected as P3 trials showed good results.  Expect serious run-up games with this catalyst.  This play is VERY high risk.  Expect only a 25% gain from .60 in the days leading up and a drop a day or two before the decision and a steeper drop after.

* February 27th, 2016 — Expected final FDA determination.   From .60 today, this decision should at the very least double the stock price and possibly triple.  With the new $110m revenue contract also kicking in around that month’s ER and additional Korean royalties I’m projecting a price target of between $1.50 and $2 at the very least with the stock continuing to appreciate as it begins selling its drug in the US and collecting royalties on world-wide sales.

-

**The Risks**

-

* FDA — No.
* FDA — We need more information.
* **ONE HUNDRED MILLION SHARES** ready to be sold in December.

-

**DISCLOSURE**

-

I do not have a stake in this company.  I am not a professional trader.  This post should be the start of your due diligence otherwise my mistakes become your own.   This stock may go down.  You may lose money.  You may lose ALL your money.   So make darn sure you know what you’re buying because you are competing with people who do.

15-11-13,The case for AMDA,"I will start by saying I have a large stake in AMDA (check the flair), so take this all with a grain of salt. 

A lot of people in the sub seem to think that there are good stocks and bad stocks. That isn't the case. In reality, there are good times to play a stock, and bad times to play a stock. During the height of AVXL's crazy rise, people were praising it left and right, and encouraging people to get in at prices that the DD simply didn't support. As soon as it crashed, it became a ""shit stock"" that no one should touch. The same is true of how this sub is reacting to AMDA. But is the hate justified? Lets look at some numbers:

pcx99 did a DD on [AMDA](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3lkpme/amda_dd_nasdaq_noncompliant_436_3mo_play_80150/) a month ago, when it was trading at .436 (God I miss those numbers). He hits all of the important points, namely:

&gt;sometime from October to November the FDA is likely to come back with a real decision this time and again the FDA approves nearly 95% of applications that have made it through clinical trials

...

&gt;talk of increasing share price centers around partnership agreements... three remaining to be disclosed... likely contingent on FDA approval

So what's changed since then? For one, we now know when the data was submitted to the FDA, so we can adjust our approval timeline to anytime in the next 90 days (or so). In addition, AMDA's Q3 ER was pretty shitty, and the dilution that hit in September was finally sellable and people bailed in a big way. End result is the SP is now under .10. A lot of people may take all this to mean AMDA is a shit stock and you should all get out. To them I say NO! It is time to buy! And let me explain why:

1) The price is real fucking low. The potential downside on this stock is diminished by being heavily oversold in the past week

2) We have an exact timeline for FDA approval, and we can see from the last time this happened that AMDA rose pretty rapidly, from .20 to .80 in the span of a month or two

3) Management has previously been pretty smart at handling the stock price, pairing good with bad news to keep things roughly even, and a top goal for them is to get over $1 by February for Nasdaq compliance. Personally I don't see this happening, but they will likely try to release partnership agreements and FDA news together to spike the price

4) Last time this sub thought that FDA approval had come, the price shot up over 30%, so despite the large number of outstanding shares this stock can move pretty quick

5) Yolo, right?

So anyway, there it is. Might still be a shit stock, might prove me wrong and keep dropping. But at this point, all the negative news is out there (minus a RS, which could happen at any moment for any reason, and be either good or bad news, depending on who you ask). There is still a lot of good news we know if going to come eventually, and we have seen before what effect this news has on the stock, so we can even guess as to what will happen. As always do your own research as well and make up your own mind.",12

All of this benefit seems to have been acknowledged in the fourth quarter, which I would assume means they received a massive subsidy from the federal government. However, after a bit of research I couldn't really figure anything out that made obvious sense, and I also didn't notice any significant increase in stock price after the income jump.

What does this mean for KB Home? I believe they're still a big player in home construction, but is it safe to invest? Is this another 2007, where they'll collapse and lose almost all market cap in another recession? Is this a government bubble? Is it safe to invest in?",11

15-11-13,Some interesting stuff with NA vs international rig counts (oil stuff),"Baker Hughes has graciously been collecting and distributing rig counts for the US and world at large for a while now.  I gets updated weekly and I would argue that next to the Cushing inventory it's one of the really solid data sources out there.  If you follow oil that is.

http://www.wtrg.com/rotaryrigs.html

Anyways, lots of interesting tidbits can be gleaned from those charts.  Here's the one that has me most interested though.   Obviously when oil prices drop like they have rig counts will drop alongside them. Worldwide we have seen a decline of about 30% in the last year (mostly in the last few months).

This page actually breaks down *where* the decline is happening though, and of that 30% (roughly 1k rigs), 700 were from the US (out of 1800), 250 were in Canada (out of 450), and the rest of the world combined only lost 100 rigs (out of 1300).

Basically North America has absorbed almost the entire loss of rig count, with Canada getting hammered the hardest (% wise).  This makes sense to me at some level if NA drilling is lower profit/requires higher oil prices, but I can't imagine this accounts for all of the differences we're seeing here.

Im not entirely sure how to interpret this.  There's a part of me that suspects that the international wells are run by companies that are either unwilling or unable to cut production in the light of low oil prices due to financial pressures.  This could imply significant weakness in their companies.   But that seems like a lot of speculation.

Anyway.  Any thoughts about this disparity?",2

15-11-14,Employee Stock Purchase Plan - Optimal Strategy,"Hey everyone!  First post, here, so go easy on me.

I am currently working for a company that is acquiring another company.  The approval from the FTC is still up in the air at this point.  We 'should' be given notice of whether or not we've been given approval BEFORE the next scheduled purchase under the ESPP.  I am wondering what I should do once my shares have been purchased, knowing full well that I can't do anything about the outcome of the acquisition (or the stock market for that matter).

Here are the potential outcomes that I see:
-The acquisition is approved, likely causing the share price to rise (before the ESPP purchase)
-The acquisition is denied, the share price has a slight correction (before the ESPP purchase)
-The acquisition is somehow delayed to a date AFTER the ESPP purchase

Note:  I understand that the correlation between approval of the acquisition and the price of the stock is not necessarily a positive 1 to 1 relationship.

I'm fairly young (22) and can afford to take a risk, but I also to make logical decisions.  Is it best to just sell right after the purchase (which I get at a 15% discount).  That way I can secure my ~15% return without exposing myself to too much market volatility.  Or should I simply hold on to the stock for a while until it hits a target price that I determine?  Under my company's ESPP plan, I do not have to hold the stock for any period of time before selling.

I think that my decision may be different in each of the possible situations listed above.

Also, what should I do once I sell my ESPP shares?  No matter what, I plan on keeping the money invested.  The decision is where to put it.  I could move the proceeds to a different brokerage account that I normally use.  I could also just keep it in the same brokerage account that the plan is under.

Lastly, is it true that the IRR for an Employee Stock Purchase Plan is actually much higher than the discount received on the purchase price (in my case, 15%)? I've read several articles that explain that the return is actually much higher, given that I am paying into the ESPP each week with each paycheck over 6 months.  At the end of the 6 months, all of my contributions are used at once to purchase the stock.  I have a general understanding of the Time-Value of money, but I am having trouble grasping the claim that the return is higher than the discount...

So, in summary, a couple of questions:
1. How long should I hold on to the stock?
2. When I sell the stock, where should I put the proceeds?
3. Can someone explain the true return on an ESPP?  Preferably in simplest terms.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, I'm looking forward to the responses.",3
15-11-14,Critique my ETF portfolio? 11-way slice-n-dice.,"###11-Way Split??


So to jump in ahead of the ""11-way split are you missing part of your brain or what mate"" comments, my intent is to own the Australian equities via a Vanguard ETF purchased on the Australian exchange (to take advantage of dividend imputation tax credits available to me as an Aussie), and the other ten international ETFs via Interactive Brokers. I will [additively rebalance](http://www.vanguard.com/pdf/icrpr.pdf) my savings into my IB account monthly; and as IB will charge me [only $1 per trade](https://www.interactivebrokers.com.au/en/index.php?f=1590&amp;p=stocks1&amp;ns=T), with a minimum of $10 per month, it'll cost me the same in brokerage whether I own one international ETF or ten. Since the [more diversity the better](https://advisors.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/ICRPC.pdf) (when brokerage costs are ignored), I went with the full ten. I also believe that - counterintuitively I know - having to ""rebalance"" the portfolio with up to ten buys every month will stop me from wanting to ""trade"" it, and make it much easier to stick to my initial allocations. As an aside, all of the below will be held in a discretionary trust so as to stream as much income/credits/capgains to my tax benefit as possible.


###Asset Type Split


I'm a 30yo Australian, hoping to retire FI:RE in 20-25 years. As such, I've gone for a fairly aggressive 85/5/10 split between Equity, REITs and Bonds. I didn't go for a zero-bond portfolio as I want to ""keep my powder dry"" in case the equity markets go to shit in the next few years.


###Equity Regional Split


I've elected to go a 60/40 US/non-US split, given that [anything more than 40% internationals](http://www.vanguard.com/pdf/ISGGEB.pdf) historically isn't worth it, and I'm seeking to piece together a broadly diversified portfolio.


###Non-US Equity Sub-Category Split


I've assigned equal weights to an Australian Shares Index ETF, a world Large Blend, and a world Small/Mid Blend. Whilst this puts me overweight on home bias Australian assets, the inclusion of the Australian Shares Index ETF is in order to take advantage of the high dividends and their associated [imputation tax credits](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Imputation/In-detail/Dividends---imputation/Reference-guide/Imputation-reference-guide/?page=4#What_is_imputation_) as a tax-advantageous streamable income source in the trust structure.


###US Equity Sub-Category Split


I've tilted towards Value stocks, given I'm in this for the long-run (20-25 years). Percentages of the five funds have been assigned to give a roughly 45/35/20 split in the overall portfolio between large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks, whilst adding a reasonable dose of US Health and US Consumer Cyclical, because I believe in the next 20-25 years the world will be [getting](http://i.imgur.com/t3tVSOj.jpg) [older](http://i.imgur.com/K5Jrzav.jpg) and wanting to [buy more shit](http://i.imgur.com/vG7KrRF.jpg).


###Bonds Sub-Category Split


I've split the bonds allocation evenly between US and International bonds, based mainly on the rough similarity in size between the two global equity markets.


### Overall Portfolio Summary


So the eleven sub-categories I have chosen and their percentages within the portfolio are:


**Sub-Category**|**% of Category**|**Overall %**|
:--:|:--:|:--:|
US Large Value|17%|9.0%|
US Mid-Cap Value|25%|13.0%|
US Small-Cap Value|32%|16.5%|
US Consumer Cyclical|13%|6.5%|
US Health|13%|7.0%|
Foreign Large Blend|33%|11.0%|
Foreign Small/Mid Blend|33%|11.0%|
Australian Shares Index ETF|33%|11.0%|
US Real Estate|100%|5.00%|
US Bonds|50%|5.00%|
International Bonds|50%|5.00%|



The ETFs I have chosen to fill these categories are:


**Sub-Category**|**Overall %**|**Code**|**Name**|
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
US Large Value|9.0%|VTV|Vanguard Value|
US Mid-Cap Value|13.0%|VOE|Vanguard Mid-Cap Value|
US Small-Cap Value|16.5%|VBR|Vanguard Small-Cap Value|
US Consumer Cyclical|6.5%|VCR|Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF|
US Health|7.0%|VHT|Vanguard Health Care ETF|
Foreign Large Blend|11.0%|EFA|iShares MSCI EAFE|
Foreign Small/Mid Blend|11.0%|SCZ|iShares MSCI EAFE Small-Cap ETF|
Australian Index Fund|11.0%|VAS.AX|Vanguard Australian Shares Index ETF|
US Real Estate|5.00%|REM|iShares Mortgage Real Estate Capped|
US Bonds|5.00%|BND|Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF|
International Bonds|5.00%|BNDX|Vanguard Total International Bond|


Morningstar's [Instant X-Ray](http://i.imgur.com/UGoowli.jpg) of the portfolio indicates I'm a little overweight on Cyclical stocks, but that's to be expected given the deliberate inclusion of a REIT and a Consumer sector fund. 


So my question to you all is: what can I do better with this Frankenstein of a portfolio plan?

I lurk these subs a lot to try and learn as much as I can, and I'm hoping I can get some solid advice and opinions on my current situation.

Background:

27 year old in Los Angeles.
Work in tech.
About 18k in my vanguard Roth IRA with VWELX
About 4K in a vanguard 401k that I need to roll over from a previous employer.

First question:

I currently max out my Roth IRA at vanguard ($5500/year) invested in 1 mutual fund, VWELX.

After doing some reading, I'm considering switching from VWELX to VTI or VFINX. Not sure if this is ideal, any thoughts on this?


Second question is:

My current employer does not match 401k, and I'm not sure what kind of investments I can participate in yet. My old employer did a small match (can't remember the percentage) up to the first 4%, so I of course contributed 4% of my salary to get the match.

I am currently building my emergency fund back up after cleaning it out to completely eliminate my student loan debt (that felt absolutely amazing!) so my emergency fund only has about 5k at the moment. I feel comfortable having 12k-15k as my goal, but I'm not there yet.

So my question is: is contributing to my employers 401k still the best thing to do at the moment? Considering there is no match? Or should I hold off on that and more aggressively fund my emergency fund? And once my emergency fund goal is achieved, should I do 401k or create a taxable account through vanguard instead and dollar cost average into another etf or mutual fund?

I should also mention I have about 3k in 0% interest credit card debt that I will completely knock out within the next few months.

15-11-14,Highway Funding Bill,"In one of my classes we had the CEO of a major shipping company talk to us. He talked about this new highway funding bill which had a few concerns regarding the shipping industry. If the bill remains unchanged it will require all shipping companies to audit their drivers. 60% of all US shipping is by small companies, as small as simply a guy in a pickup truck to a small business with 100 trucks. 

This will really hurt that 60%. Now what does this mean? Large shipping companies will have dramatic power to raise prices as they have the capital to pay for this audit no problem. 

The last bill to affect shipping was one where they require drivers to only be able to drive at night 5 days a week vs 6 or 7 they were before. They estimated the loss in shipping productivity to be 1-2%. It ended up being 5%. 

The government estimates this new bill to influence shipping by 5%. The CEO said it will more likely be up to 15%. 

Large shipping companies are going to start dominating. I'm going long UPS and Fedex. 

TLDR: new highway funding bill will crush 60% of shipping if it remains unchanged. Large companies will profit immensely. ",12

15-11-14,VRX - Valeant Pharmaceuticals DD - Bull Case,"Alright you idiots time to listen up. We're going to take a look into Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a yolo worthy bio pharm. You may be familiar with Valeant for a number of reasons including but not exclusive to: Bill Ackman, Bernie Sanders accusing them of price gouging, Citron Research's report that sent VRX tumbling, or their shady business practices on blast in the media (Philidor).

If you've been paying any attention to this story you should know about Philidor, the specialty pharmaceutical company that was engaging in shady business practices with Valeant. They operated as two separate businesses, however Valeant owned options to buy Philidor at a 0 Strike. Valeant claimed they did not own Philidor, and in the technical definition they didn't, but if you can convert at a 0 strike you have no cost of capital, you own the fuckin company. Philidor had other sketchy practices, they were known for acquiring drugs and marking up their prices. Much like Martin Shkreli - CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals who was in the public recently for the same thing. He had an interesting [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3q38qg/iama_martin_shkreli_ceo_of_turing_pharmaceuticals/) where he briefly defended Valeant's business model.  

On 11/10 VRX hosted a call to inform us of details on how they plan to sever their relationship with Philidor. Although this will be a loss in revenue, it's important to note that Philidor only contributed $190mn or 6.8% of VRX's 3Q revnue of $2.8bn. Philidor was one of many revenue source for VRX. Let's look at some more numbers; Revenue in 2012, '13, and '14 increased 44.0, 62.7, 43.2% respectively. Factoring in Philidor, analysts anticipate VRX's revenue to increase 20.9% in 2015. 

Even with the loss of Philidor, Valeant will continue to see a strong rise in EPS projected 30.1% yoy growth for 2015 and 20.6% for 2016. Valeant has been beaten up recently and fundamentally offers a very attractive opportunity. Just remember, this is still a yolo, there is a chance this whole thing goes down in flames. Valeant other lines of business could also be acting sketchy, leading to further problems. There's also a chance politicians pursue regulation prohibiting drug companies from marking up prices at their digression. God damn socialist politicians messing with the free market.

I think things will shake out alright for VRX and they'll recovery from their current highly discounted valuation. That's why I went long this past week. That being said, its going to be a volatile ride, so make sure to strap in the roller coaster. Patient will be key with this trade.  


How would you play VRX, even as a paper trade? Finally, I will provide sources for my data if you PM me.

1)These are my opinions and they should not be used solely to make investment decisions. Please do your own research and DD, that way you can formulate your own decision.

For example, say your personal tax rate is 30%, but your investments are in a company that pays no company tax and return 10% pa.

15-11-15,"Only 3% of pharmaceuticals are actual cures, whereas genetic therapy could one day cure everything. Here are my thoughts from an investor's perspective.","TLDR; Genetic therapy will render pharmaceuticals obsolete according to this TEDx talk. I'm about to ditch my pharma portfolio and it feels great.

This discussion is based on the following TEDxBerlin talk: https://youtu.be/W3C23m71Yws

According to the speaker (a pharmaceutical scientist as I've understood it), the pharmaceutical approach to disease is doomed to fail within our lifetime. More or less as the result of genetic therapy taking over pharmaceutical therapy.

The speaker bases this on the fact that only 3% of all pharmaceuticals on the market are actual cures, with the remaining 97% only treating symptoms without dealing with the underlying cause.

This is something that I've personally been talking about for the last 10 years, with pharma professionals and doctors, and they all just accept this fact. They say there's not much we can do, but agree that it sucks that we basically have no cures.

Since curing disease, rather than just treating the symptoms, should be the ultimate goal of life science, it is only a question of time until scientists unlock a new tool that can start curing diseases.

Genetics have long been the main contender in this field. With the recent advancements in CRISPR/CAS9, it's for the first time very likely that genetic therapy could actually become an everyday thing. And for the first time, this will allow doctors to cure and fix the underlying cause rather than just hide the symptoms.

Why would we need the majority of pharmaceutical products if this becomes reality? I.e., what's the role of pharmaceutical companies in the future?

My inner voice has been telling me to move away from pharma investments and look more into biotech and genetics specifically. Until now, it's been a tough move, emotionally. But with CRISPR/CAS9 on the horizon, and the insights from the TEDx talk, I actually feel comfortable in ditching all of my pharma stocks completely.

It's a damn good feeling. But of course, I'm open for a healthy dose of criticism.",217

15-11-15,"Elon Musk's credibility on outlandish claims/goals.","I like to see things written out, so I'm going to make this timeline about (some of) the times Tesla has made inaccurate claims and missed deadlines by a landslide. I believe it is about time that Tesla's and/or Musk's claims stopped being taken as law. The inability to keep on schedule is something which has had me disappointed with Tesla in the past, and it's something that current shareholders seem overwhelmingly okay with ignoring.

Let's look at the track record. I'll fill in the timeline as much as I can, but I'd love if others could contribute. I'll add them as we go along:

***

**2008:**

 - ""Tesla Motors, an electric car start-up in Silicon Valley, said Wednesday that it would lay off employees and delay production of its second car, the Model S"" ([Source, Oct. 2008](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/technology/start-ups/16tesla.html?_r=0))

 ***

 - ""Mr. Musk posted the changes on Tesla’s Web site. He said the company was in a “critical phase” and would have a positive cash flow within nine months."" ([Source, Oct. 2008](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/technology/start-ups/16tesla.html?_r=0)) 

I may be wrong, but I believe Tesla still has yet to reach a positive cash flow, although they do sound confident that it's on the horizon.

***

**2009:**

 - ""Apparently, a number of Roadster reservation holders who had already placed hefty deposits (as much as $50,000 dollars) on the Tesla, had locked in their orders and picked their options recently received letters and phone calls informing them that they were unlocked from their orders and their spot in the line was in jeopardy if they didn't re-option their rides."" ([Source, Jan. 2009](http://www.autoblog.com/2009/01/20/tesla-raises-prices-on-roadster-options-sparks-controversy-ang/))

Basically, the Roadster was sold with loads of options included in the price, then Tesla told buyers they needed to pay extra for those options or lose their place in the queue. Here's a quote by buyer #395 from [another article](http://forcechange.com/1881/bad-pr-tesla-forces-pre-ordered-roadster-owners-to-pay-more/): 

""I am [pre-ordered owner] number 395. I am not a rich person dabbling in a plaything. I thought I was actually doing some good by supporting a company that was moving us to a more sustainable future. I put $50,000 of my own money down on this car in May of 2007. I withstood the delays. I held in there when it almost seemed the company was going bankrupt. Now, after locking in my options, they pull this on me. Elon Musk does not understand the power of evangelicals to the cause. Steve Jobs does. The same power that can bring people to the cause can turn the same power in a 180 degree turn against the cause. From this day forward, that’s what I’m going to do.""

This is really interesting, because people love to talk about how early Tesla buyers were all so rich they didn't care about the price bump. This proves those claims wrong.

**2010:**

 - CEO Elon Musk is now saying he expects to launch the Model S sedan “within two and a half years.” [Source, Jan, 2010](http://sfcitizen.com/blog/2010/01/15/yet-another-delay-for-telsa-motors-model-s-coming-in-850-days-or-so-maybe/)

The base MSRP was also claimed to start at $49,900. The price was later raised and the current base price for a Model S is $70,000 before incentives and savings. That's a 40% increase. If you were to apply that same increase based on percentage, the Model 3 would not start at $35,000 as Tesla leads the media to believe, but much closer to $49,000.


***

**2011:**

 - ""Three battery options are offered: 160-, 230-, or 300-mile range. Model S comes standard with the 160-mile range battery at the quoted $49,900 base price (after the $7,500 Federal Tax Credit). The 230-mile and 300-mile range batteries are optional upgrades. The 230-mile range option is priced at about $10,000 more than the base and the 300-mile option at about $20,000 more than the base."" ([Source, Aug. 2011](http://acarisnotarefrigerator.com/2011/08/04/tesla-readies-the-model-s/), scroll to where it says, ""Ownership and Pricing"")

This would mean the pricing goes as $49,900, $59,900, and $69,900. This is very inaccurate. The base Model S with a 70KwH, 230 mile range starts at $70,000. The Model S 85KwH Dual motor starts at $85,000 and is the closest to 300 miles of range. It starts at $15,000 more than the original claimed number, with less range.

**2012:**

 - ""The seven-passenger Model X promises to be more versatile and family-friendly than the Model S, and will double the size of Tesla’s current U.S. lineup when it eventually goes on sale sometime in early 2015."" ([Source, Feb. 2012](http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2015-tesla-model-x-photos-and-info-news)) It is late 2015, and only a handful have been delivered.  

 ***

 - Tesla announces the Model 3 will be on the roads by 2015 ([Source, Jul. 2012](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1077655_tesla-says-all-electric-3-series-competitor-due-by-2015)). It is November of 2015 and we have yet to even see a rendering, so one could easily draw the conclusion that it won't happen this year.

**2013:**

- ""Tesla SEC filing reveals Model X electric SUV production delayed until 2014"" ([Source, Mar. 2013](http://www.torquenews.com/1075/tesla-sec-filing-reveals-model-x-electric-suv-production-delayed-until-2014))

Yet, here we are at the late end of 2015 and only a handful have been delivered. There were no deliveries in 2014. At this time, you cannot even access a configurator unless you're an early reservation holder. 

***

**2014:**

 - Tesla Confirms Model X Arrival For Early 2015 ([Source, Jun. 2014](http://www.valuewalk.com/2014/06/tesla-model-x-launch-date/))

Delayed. As has been said, we're in late 2015 with only a handful of deliveries. 

***

**2015:**

 - ""On Tuesday, Tesla will deliver the company's first Model X SUVs to customers. By doing so, CEO Elon Musk will make good on a promise to get the Model X to market in the third quarter."" 

Wrong. Besides six Model X vehicles delivered ([Source](http://money.cnn.com/2015/09/29/autos/tesla-model-x/) | [LA Times puts it well](http://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-modelx-launch-questions-20150930-story.html)), Tesla did not ""get the Model X to market in the third quarter"". It merely made a handful of them for the sole purpose of pretending they were ready. They fast-tracked just enough to have a few on the road here and there, but unless we're at least in the low four-figure range of deliveries then we can't pretend it's been brought to market. ",150
15-11-15,Area Man Sells House at Auction for $780,"[Just posted a new article.  It's long but it's worth it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3t2r1u/record_number_of_arrests_made_after_massive_sec/)

(In case [racoonunderthehouse's idea for an onion-esque WSB website takes off](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3suwlc/going_out_on_a_limb_here_the_onion_and_wsbfinance))

Local resident Philip Lousa-Monet recently sold his house at auction for $780, according to sources in his neighborhood. 

""It was absolutely insane,"" said Jeffery Kleinman, a neighbor who wished to remain anonymous. ""Me and my wife were watching the evening news when we hear him screaming in the street.  We ran outside and saw him feverishly waving his deed around, yelling about bids starting at $500. A few people gathered around and he ended up getting $780 for it. I mean, his fucking house!  What's his problem?""

We were able to track Philip down in a nearby Starbucks,  surrounded by suitcases, clicking his shitty laptop's touchpad incessantly. When asked for an interview he told this reporter to ""go fuck yourself, I'm waiting for the BGMD 10Q."" 

Luckily we found his wife sobbing in their car shortly afterwards, and she granted us an interview. ""I just got home from work and he was smashing the computer screen with his keyboard and screaming 'They were fucking print shop owners!'  Then he ran out and held his stupid auction.""

While his wife was unable to provide any more explanation for his absurd actions, a search of public records found a lawsuit filed against him by the harbor yachtyard. According to court records, he signed a lease for a 122' schooner and convinced the yachtyard to rename it ""SS AVXL"".  We called the yachtyard and reached the owner. 

""Well, this guy just walked into the office one day and said he wanted to buy a yacht."" said owner Peter Shelby.  ""He refused to pay up front, though, he said it was because he 'has to double down before it hits $20'.  No fucking clue what he was on about but I figured he hit the lotto or something. We're suing for damages related to his requested modifications to the boat. I mean, he had us paint a dick on the sides! A big black dick!"" 

As of publishing, the Starbucks barrista tells us he's still sitting in their store. ""We just let him stay there through the weekend, he's not really causing any harm. He seemed pretty happy when I left on Friday - told me he'd managed to get another thousand shares before close, whatever that means.""

Edit: glad everyone liked this. I'll start writing these more often. Fuck you all! ",221

15-11-15,eBay,"I have Amazon Prime, but spend a lot more money on eBay.com. I also own both AMZN and EBAY stock. (bought eBay post split)


I'm long eBay with the simple [Peter Lynch perspective](http://i.imgur.com/9t0Tm1d.jpg). I love it, I use it, I understand it, and want a piece. I like eBay because it has great filters, and easy to search for the item I want. The majority of the items I buy are free shipping, and most arrive in the same amount of days as Amazon's 2 day shipping. Most are shipped USPS expedited shipping. Amazon you pay tax, regardless of where the item is sold, eBay only charges tax if within the same state as buyer. 


I love Amazon’s sameday shipping though. Paying $5.99 to have something delivered to you with a couple hours. That is amazing.  To consider how much time/$ it would cost you to get in your car and drive to buy it yourself, $5.99 is a great great value. 


Some might say eBay sells a lot of knock off products, but most of that was shifted over to the new site ioffer.com. Based off of customer reviews, I've found a lot of Amazon fulfilled items that were fake. For example, the American Crew and other beauty products. Amazon has also been fighting the fake reviews. Seller on Amazon sells someone at Fiverr products for $0 dollars, then they are able to leave numerous fake reviews.  


For selling: IMO, listing and selling items on Ebay is a *breeze*.  And this is why I believe eBay has such a differential advantage. Anyone with a PayPal account can launch a store. As a total rook, I've been able to list, sell, and print shipping labels throught eBay and Paypal. I’ve tried a Shopify and Squarespace store before… eBay is easier for bootstrapping. 


I admit, I haven't put a lot of effort into listing something on Amazon, and I quickly gave up when I saw all that was required. I think eBay has a great niche for independent sellers, and most don’t go to Amazon unless they are going for fulfillment. I’d never buy something on Amazon that wasn’t prime; I’d just go buy the same item on eBay with free shipping. 

For example, last purchase on eBay was 6 office chairs: 
I first looked at Costco, because that’s where I bought my last ones. The one on eBay was cheaper than Costco and the AmazonBasics version, and had free shipping. I also factored in the tax I’d have to pay buying from Amazon/Costco, so eBay was a sure choice. [4,300 Sold](http://www.ebay.com/itm/PU-Leather-High-Back-Executive-Office-Task-Chair-w-Metal-Base-for-Computer-Desk-/360868404143?hash=item54056edbaf:g:ZTIAAOSwl9BWGC1O)


----------------------------------------------------------------------

I know this isn't a technical review, just a plain explanation on why eBay has a strong differential advantage. I've been writing covered calls and holding some long calls and I'm optimistic for a big 4Q following their [3Q](http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/10/23/ebays-third-quarter-results-come-in-better-than-expected-driving-stock-higher/) surprise...

15-11-16,What WSB has taught a new trader...,"-I'm a new trader...

-I just started investing my dollars in the past few months...

-I learned about the basics from the r/investing and other sites...like, how many physical gold nuggets and memorial 9/11 silver coins do I hide in the yard...or in the crawlspace?

-Learn what ETFs I buy and hold for 10 years for a 3% safe return.

-Dipped the tip with with acorns to see what it feels like to invest in ETFs...

-Immediately lost $1000+ out of 10k the next week on the big monday crash...

-Watch as my acorns account slowly (never) recovers then continues to dip and never reach its original investment, even after dividend payouts...

-Stumble upon WSB...read this insanity every day for weeks, learning new things every day...

-Download robinhood...

-Buy stocks in industries I understand.  Get 30% returns and cash out to reinvest.

-Buy UVXY @$37, lose a lot.  Sell on 13th for $37, wish I kept it in for monday :*( 

-Buy SUNE when every site says its at an all time low. Get deep dildonic probes in my gainz.

-Still up $400 on a 5k investment.

In the end I learned that I could wait 5 years to see (maybe) a small return with safe investing...or watch stocks I understand, buy low, sell high, cash out at peaks and reinvest...then yolo on NBG.

15-11-16,"How's my swing/day trading pick strategy brahs?","Just read up a bunch on this subreddit and a bunch of articles, and i'm wondering how good is my method of judging whether a certain stock is good or not, help appreciated. 

Ideally, I want fundamentals and technical analysis/price action going for me, so here's what I just did: 


1) Pick up a list of stocks: I get them from places where stocks are being hyped like newsletters and allpenystocks.com, this subreddit and maybe r/pennystocks, insidertrading.com 

2) Filter through their fundamentals, I want to get the ones, maybe like the top 5-10, with the best. I usually look for Catalysts, debt:equity ratio, current (current liability:current assets) ratio, Return on assets (Net revenue/Total assets) and net revenue history

I also take a quick look at acquisitions, intangible assets, earnings reports (they usually give a good update on what the company is doing, supposedly) and goodwill 

Also, I go on gurureports.com and Nasdaq to see their ratings 

and i'd also filter out the ones that are in industries that aren't doing so well

3) After building that list, I would commence with technical analysis. Make sure volume is supporting the trend. Make sure that all indicators that indicate bullish activity and momentum are going where they should go (I think I use ADR, ADX (?), A/D and like one other thing) and MACD) and I use ATR (The thing that measures how far off average they spike and dip, aka volatility) 


Once again, I filter the ones that aren't looking too good, and from there choose the stocks that are setting up well chart-wise based off of the information from investopedia's ""5 charts you need to know"" (The cup and handle, the triangle, the flagpoles, mostly) and set stop losses/limit sells as the stock goes up and down accordingly to maximize gains, lock in profits and to prepare for huge downtrends

Shoppers started gravitating toward discount stores during the recession, and many have failed to return to shopping in full-price stores.

Once they realized they could get steeply discounted merchandise, they became addicted to seeking out good deals on food, clothes, shoes, and other items.

Now retailers like Macy's and Nordstrom are paying the price.",0

15-11-16,"Novice: Recently came into some money, have been interested in investing and economics, read Flash Boys and The Physics of Wall Street, now looking for your educated, perhaps anecdotal advice.","Some background: A family member recently passed. They left me with $50,000, currently invested in a moderate-risk portfolio managed by a company that knows what they're doing. 

I'm early 20s, have no debt, and bring in about 40-45k/yr (pre-tax) in an area with a high cost of living. I am thinking about moving some money around, with, and this is just arbitrary, maybe 15% of the portfolio switched to short-term gains (and potential losses) more in line with high frequency trading and the likes. This is money I'd like to have in the market for the next 5 years, give or take a few. 25% I'd like to have invested to take out in the next 10-15 years as I look to put a down payment on a home. The remaining 60% I would like to have safe, steady gains for retirement. 

My general strategy as I've theoretically looked at this rests on a few simple ideas:

1. If a stock you own doubles in value, then sell half. 

2. Set aside a % to invest over time. For example, if you choose to invest 2% from each months pay into spdr funds, stick to it. The market falls, you improve your position, the market rises, you're still increasing your position with money you're willing to lose. Gains offset losses, yadda yadda...

Now, please tell me why I'm wrong and what you would do if you were in a position similar to mine. I'm a recent graduate, have no background in finance, economics, or the markets so have just been trying to learn as much as I can. It seems like a worthwhile thing to do.

* Put vs. call skew is high (88th percentile). Demand for puts is unusually high compared to calls.

* ATM implied volatility is low compared to realized volatility (spread = -15.16%, 10th percentile). buying inexpensive outright puts or calls can be a good idea if continued historical volatility levels are expected.

* Volatility put skew is high (86th percentile), indicating that out-of-the-money puts are being heavily bought relative to at-the-money options. if interested in adding long exposure sell expensive out-of-the-money puts, collect high premium and initiate long positions at lower prices if exercised.

New drilling (shale) technology has unleashed large quantities of crude oil unforeseen by many.

Oil producers find themselves in a ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" (a la Game Theory): they want others to stop producing, but can't stop themselves.

As in the natural gas industry, Wall Street encouraged shale production growth over profits and drillers hence oversupplied the oil market.

Key Insight: Because shale oil production can be ramped up and rapidly brought to market, shale will put a ceiling on oil prices, not a floor.

Since Activision Blizzard is one of there subsidaries (though Blizzard North was the subsidary, so perhaps after Activision bought them they are exposed far less?) I wonder how any effect on Vivendi might effect Activision Blizzard.

I don't really know to much about the relationship between the two, but I assume a loss of business over the next week to VIV.PA could cause it to pull some money out of ATVI - are my fears unwarranted?

15-11-17,Experience with Instavest?,"I am interested in becoming proficient in stock trading. At this point, I'm comfortable with the investments I am making for my retirement. I currently have two 401Ks, one with company match (5%) and the other with vanguard. Additionally, I am taking advantage of my companies stock incentive which is buy 3 shares and the company will give you the 4th share free. I also have 4 months worth of expenses on my savings account as an emergency fund. 

I would like to use $2K to start trading in the stock market, but I have never purchased stock before. This would be my first time. After spending all day doing research and learning the fundamentals, I came across a trading platform named Instavest. The concept sound appealing, but I think the whole model underestimates the greediness from stock traders. In other words, I find it difficult to believe that traders will voluntarily donate part of the profits to the lead investor.

Just in case, a little background about me. I am an analyst for a big consumer package goods (CPG) company. I am very familiar with forecasting, finding &amp; understanding causes/correlations.

Has anyone traded through that platform before? If so, would you recommend it for me?

15-11-16,$PTLA thoughts,"I read this article with a lot of interest from a medical point of view: http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1510991

Background:  You may know relatives or friends that have had blood clots in their legs or lungs, or have a mechanical heart valve, or atrial fibrillation, or any host of other conditions that require them to be prescribed blood thinners. The oldest and most studied of these drugs is warfarin. However, newer drugs that in many scenarios have shown better efficacy for preventing clots that are commonly used in North America include rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis) and dabigatran (Pradaxa). As a family physician/PCP (in Canada) who also works in the ER, I see plenty of patients who have minor and severe bleeds related to their anticoagulant medications. If they are on warfarin, their bleeding can often be easily reversed with a medication (now standard of care in all ERs) called Octaplex. However, the latter three newer drugs, which are being used more and more frequently, do not as of yet have a drug that can fully reverse their anticoagulation effects. 

Enter Portola (PTLA) and their new drug andexanet which met all clinical endpoints intended in the recent ANNEXA trial (see link above). I feel this may be a big practice changer in that I anticipate this type of drug/reversal agent will become ubiquitous in ERs in the next couple years. I am not familiar with any close competitor with results as good as these so see this as a huge potential opportunity. 

As someone with no significant finance background, has anyone done DD into PTLA or have any experience with them? Your thoughts would be much appreciated.  ",2
15-11-16,DD: Yachts,"I have some experience in this... well, not buying a yacht, but being on one.

I took the wheel of a schooner a few years ago, several times. My parents' friend's rich friend owned it. One time, we were in rough seas and I moved the ship in a way to maximize speed (mostly 'cause I often confuse right and left, FML) and a passenger almost went overboard. (worth the rush) That was the last time I was allowed on the wheel.

The schooner has a crew of several people, some of whom need to be paid. Don't forget the massive idiot-wheelman insurance. And, of course, yearly maintenance and, depending on where your yacht is located and its construction, winter storage costs.

Yachts are a status symbol but also a money sink. You don't have to be too rich to own one and you can burn a lot of money with it. So, people might confuse you as ultra-rich, when, in fact, you are not.

Depending on the type of yacht, the resale value can be quite good. For example, the schooner I was on will always maintain its resale value because of its uniqueness. (it also won sailing awards, but a lot of that is the crew)

-------------------

My advice is: be careful not to buy a starter yacht that is too expensive for you because then you'll be stuck paying for all the costs instead of making yolo money in order to buy a bigger and better yacht.",3

They are likely to claim bankruptcy within a year OR China will bail them out. You can YOLO the fuck out of YGE if you think the latter is going to be true. China already 'kind of' bailed them out.

**Recent activity** 

Cancer Genetics, Inc.(CGIX) , an emerging leader in DNA-based cancer diagnostics, offering bench to the bedside solutions, today confirmed the closing of its previously announced public offering of 3,000,000 shares of its common stock with five-year warrants to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $5.00 per share at a combined price to the public of $4.00. Cancer Genetics’ gross proceeds from this offering were $12.0 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, as well as other estimated offering expenses payable by Cancer Genetics.  The underwriters were granted a 45-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of 450,000 additional shares of common stock and/or warrants.  The underwriters’ option to purchase additional warrants was exercised and sold today.

On recent earnings it expanded its revenue but missed estimates. 

Its trading at its 52 week low and has had some short term consolidation with high volume. There is a possibility of a short term rebound. My play would be to set your tight stop loss and play for 30-40% rebound.

**STORY**: The story from mid-September reads like a tragicomedy.

* (edit: forgot to add this) A $66m follow-on offering is completed on the 23rd.
* On the same day (the 23rd), [Traces of particles were found](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/suspension-of-devices-manufactured-by-silimed) on some implants by a German private company inspecting Silimed (the partner's) main factory on behalf of MHRA, the FDA-like agency of the UK. Silimed's CE mark was then suspended till December. This didn't affect Sientra directly because they don't sell in the US.
* Silimed's factories were shut down by Brazillian authorities, mirroring the CE mark suspension.
* Sientra voluntarily stopped selling product in the US as a precaution.
* [Just as the MHRA was starting to go through the process of figure out what to do](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/devices-made-by-silimed/latest-update-15-october-2015), Silimed's main factory (out of 2) was then presumably completely destroyed by an enormous fire on October 22. [See the video of the fire here](http://extra.globo.com/noticias/rio/incendio-atinge-fabrica-em-vigario-geral-na-zona-norte-do-rio-17853018.html).
* The CEO, well-respected among cosmetic surgeons, resigned (but stays on the board).

The events above all made SIEN stock drop from $20.50s to $3.21 today.

---------
Status: The stock is trading at $3.21 as of November 16, 2015. On September 30, cash per share was $8.20 (148.9m), but with an outstanding long-term loan of $24.5m. [After a forced long-term loan repayment in late October](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1551693/000110465915073522/a15-21922_1ex99d1.htm), cash per share would be $124.4m ($148.9m - $24.5m) minus cash burn for the last month and a half, which is probably somewhere between 500K to 2M, so conservatively, 122.4m as of November 16, which translates to $6.80 a share, over double the current stock price.

Without the events starting on mid-September, Sientra would have likely had a much smaller loss. The 10Q referenced above, as well as the [PR](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1551693/000110465915079306/a15-23114_1ex99d1.htm), shows that net income was $6.996m, (net revs. $9,929m) total operating expenses were $12.6m, and total loss was $6.604m -- however, Sientra took an allowance for returns of its product of $3m. Discounting that allowance, Sientra would have only a loss of 3.6m -- $1.608m of that loss interest expense, which they have entirely paid off.

Sientra has one year of inventory that they need to inspect (5 year shelf life) and then, presumably, will consult with the FDA to ask them for an official ""OK"" in order to sell the implants. (The FDA has not taken any regulatory action)

Sientra does not yet know whether they will work with Silimed to build a new factory or to refurbish the smaller factory to produce implants. They are waiting on Silimed's word, which is working with the government / fire department.

---------

Some sort-of technical stuff: Sientra has a PMA (pre-marketing approval from the FDA, which one gains by trialing breast implant products for several years. (Sientra bought it from Silimed's US arm, which then became part of Sientra) Sientra will not need to file any new paperwork with the FDA in order to use product from the other factory. They will need to file what is called a ""PMA supplement"" in order to use the product made by another manufacturer altogether, if it comes to that. In that case, it wouldn't take more than a few weeks/months.

**NEW CEO credentials are nice**:
The new CEO is known for being the CEO of successful small companies in related fields that were bought out, though he says that his objective is actually getting production and sales started again:


""Jeffrey Nugent has served as on the Sientra Board of Directors since July 2014. Most recently, Mr. Nugent served as Interim President, Chief Executive Officer and a Director of Biolase, Inc. from June 2014 until July 2015. Prior to that, he was Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Precision Dermatology, Inc., a multi channel skin care / dermatology company that was acquired by Valeant, Inc. in 2014 for approximately $500MM. From 1999 to 2002, Mr. Nugent served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Revlon Inc. Previously, he served as Worldwide President and Chief Executive Officer of Neutrogena from the time of its acquisition by Johnson &amp; Johnson until 1999.

15-11-17,On the topic of analysts and their recommendations,"Hey all. I'm a computer science/philosophy student, and as such I haven't the funds with which to invest in things. That being said, I often make recommendations to my father. I would like to end up developing my own video games, or at least, I plan on working in the industry. So, naturally, I spend a lot of time researching the industry. A while back, I got my father to invest in Nintendo at about $14 (or was it $18?) per share, and when the shares peaked around March 18 (when Nintendo announced their mobile phone plan), I had him sell at $24.70, and he made $10000 or so in profit. Pretty good, I say. Anyway, I made the mistake of failing to follow other companies' stocks, and I recently noticed that many companies have had their stock prices rising at a consistent rate through October/November this year. Ubisoft and Activision-Blizzard have had major increases, while EA has been on that trend for a couple of years. So, when I noticed how the stocks of Ubisoft and Activision-Blizzard have been rising in value, I was a bit annoyed that I hadn't bothered to look at them earlier. I also noticed that their rising values were beginning to level out, and so I figured it'd be a big risk to buy into them. But when I took a look at analysts' projections, most recommended buying. Why is this? Why would anyone buy into a stock that's losing momentum at its highest-ever value? Activision-Blizzard is working out a deal with King, and although that could boost their stock's value if it goes through (in February, I think), it could just as easily fuck shit up if it falls through. Same with the Warcraft movie; I saw the trailer, and I can see things going well or not-so-well for that film. It just seems strange to jump on a train that's slowing down and for which the next destination is unknown. If these analysts had a better idea of what that destination might be, I'd be more understanding, but they don't seem to have a clue.

Is there something I'm not seeing?

Also, as a side note, I can't really figure out what's caused the Ubisoft stock to surge. Is it their acquisition of Longtail Studios? I mean, that's pretty cool, because I'm studying in Halifax, but it doesn't seem all too significant in terms of market projections. I suppose it does signify that the company will be investing more time and money into mobile games, and people are still pretty hyped about those (see Nintendo). Also, that reminds me that I need to find out if I can do a co-op placement there. That'd be siiiiiiiick.",5

15-11-17,"Tesla's Model 3 will not start at $35,000. There's no way.","I believe it will cost around $49,000 before tax incentives. The base MSRP for the Model S was originally claimed to start at $49,900 for a 40KwH battery pack. The price was later raised and the current base price for a Model S is $70,000 before incentives and savings. That's a 40% increase. If you were to apply that same increase based on percentage, the Model 3 would not start at $35,000 as Tesla leads the media to believe, but much closer to $49,000. 

Here are some of the big challenges they're facing:

***

 - Delays - At least 2 years 

They promised to have them on the roads by [2015](http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1077655_tesla-says-all-electric-3-series-competitor-due-by-2015), but there still has not been a rendering or any concrete news from Tesla. Elon tweeted that they'd begin taking orders in March of 2016 with deliveries being made in 2 years [Source](http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a12983/35000-tesla-model-iii-coming-in-2017/).

The last thing we want to see at this point is what Elon Musk said for the Model X being that they went overboard with engineering. That will just raise the price. 

***

 - Steel would need to be used to reduce costs, but that would lower range and performance due to weight.

If they used aluminum, that in combination with the costs of batteries, and the fact that Tesla will need to produce this as a base-model luxury car to compete with the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes C-Class, could bring prices close to my $49,000 number. Ford's new F150 pickup with aluminum build is about as mass-market as they come, and those trucks' MSRP bases at $25,071 for XL work truck specification, and $29,416 for shiny work truck specification. ([Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/0gwYYxD.png) | [Website](http://shop.ford.com/build/f150/?gnav=header-trucks#/select/)) Those are just no-option pickup trucks and the chromed one accounts for 84% of the supposed $35,000 starting price for the Model 3. I don't see how they plan to build an electric entry-level luxury car with that price. 

***

 - Battery costs - Around $15K

It's been said that the battery in a Model S costs around $30,000 ([Source](http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-world-vexed-by-slow-progress-on-batteries-1412552377)). Let's say, to give the Model 3 a head start, that the $30K number is for the 85KwH battery. Let's say that the Model 3 will have a 60KwH battery. That's a 29.41% reduction. If we apply that reduction in percentage to the cost, that gives us a $21,176 battery. After the Gigafactory is complete, that will supposedly make a 30% dent in battery costs.

This leaves us with a rough estimate of $14,823 for a 60KwH battery in the Model 3.

***

 - Manufacturing costs

I dug around to see how much assembly costs add to the price of a car. It's way trickier than you might think to find anything from a reputable source. Tesla has a relationship with Toyota, so I'll use this:

&gt; “60 percent of the cost of the car is the investment into the plant. 20 percent is the parts that go in the car,” says Toyota’s photogenic Executive Vice President Atsushi Niimi.  

([Source](http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2011/02/toyota’s-secret-weapon-low-cost-car-factories/), scroll to 7th paragraph)

The plant in which the Model 3 will be built is yet to be announced, but the Gigafactory will need to be paid for so we'll use that as a semi-substitute (as both costs would be needed to reach a more accurate number, but it will suffice). A good car to compare this to is the [Jaguar XE](http://www.autonews.com/article/20140908/OEM04/140909884/aluminum-jaguar-xe-marks-return-to-compact-luxury-segment) which features aluminum construction and is in the same class the Model 3 aims to compete in.

The Jaguar XE's plant will be the new Jaguar Land Rover Solihull plant which is part of a $2.5 billion investment. Jaguar and Land Rover will both share the plant and it will be part of producing [five different models](http://www.autonews.com/assets/pdf/ane-congress/Solihull-Site-information.pdf) split between Jaguar and Land Rover's line-ups. Tesla will only have three models to pay off its expensive Gigafactory where Jaguar will have five to pay off its cheaper factory.


***

 - Possible cancellation of tax incentives. 

This will literally boost the price by $7,500 across the board in the U.S, and in states like Maryland it could boost the price from between $3,000 and $10,500 depending on which incentives are cancelled (state/federal/both). This would be a very big hit to potential clients and could in itself bring the number close to my $49,000 base price. 

***

 - Buy-in supercharger access

This isn't necessarily for Tesla as a channel of income, it's more to clear congestion for current Model S and future Model X owners. There are already complaints from owners of full stations in densely populated areas which is where most Tesla owners live. A wave of mass-market Model 3 owners would not help the situation.

A buy-in option for Model 3 owners could be handled any number of ways. A one time payment which used to be an option charged for the Model S 60/60D. It's hard to place an exact number, a price like $2,000 which is close to the one charged for the Model S might scare away potential Model 3 clients, so it's hard to pinpoint an exact number. Possibly a monthly subscription for access of $50 or so. After 5 years of paying the subscription, Tesla would make (more than) the money it charged the S60(D) owners and it could be used to fund the expansion of the networks. 

Everybody wins:   
The people who spent the most money on the Model S and X would have limited congestion, Model 3 owners would still have the opportunity to use the network, and Tesla could use the money to maintain and/or expand the network to further clear the congestion and open new routes for more potential Model 3 buyers.

15-11-16,Record Number of Arrests Made after Massive SEC Investigation,"A staggering 5,600 people were arrested across the country Monday morning, destroying what federal prosecutors are calling the largest financial crime syndicate in history.  “It’s unprecedented,” said US Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch.  “The logistics of pulling this off were absolutely ludicrous.”

The investigation began in May of 2015, when SEC Examiner Mark Garrett came across an unusual amount of online chatter about semiconductor manufacturer Advanced Micro Devices.  He granted me the pleasure of a phone afternoon on Sunday evening, after I had signed a non-disclosure agreement and submitted to a polygraph at the local FBI office. Over the course of two hours, he walked me through the months-long investigation.  

“Well, I was new to the SEC and I was assigned to the online monitoring division.  Our job was pretty simple - we read through the usual forums, newsletters, and websites, looking for anything that raised a flag.  In May I noticed that a lot of chatter was popping up over AMD, which everyone in the industry knew was a shit stock.  Poor earnings, not a lot of good news on the horizon, shit like that.  But for some reason this forum called Wall Street Bets kept telling people it was a buy!”  

Wall Street Bets, or “WSB” for short, is an online forum hosted on the website Reddit.com.  It boasts nearly 25,000 members, all of whom enjoy the practice of “Yoloing”, where they throw money away in ill-advised stock trades.  This forum became the focus of Garrett's investigation.  

“The guys are fucking nuts,” he explained.  “They pumped the hell out of AMD with some made-up fundamental bullshit.  The price actually jumped in late May, but it was on weak volume and pretty much only because of idiots from the internet buying in.  Ended up dropping a few weeks later when everyone remembered that it was shit.”  

“After that, I started keeping track of them.  They had a hard-on for some of the most outrageously bad companies that are traded publicly.  Back in August they started pumping High Performance Beverages Comp., which trades under the symbol TBEV.  It was a completely shit company but these guys made it sound like it was bottling Jesus’ piss.”

TBEV proved to be a windfall for some, as the stock’s OTC price of about $0.001 allowed even the most poorly-funded trader to buy many thousands of shares, driving the price up about 300%.  However, the rise was short-lived, and many more lost money as the excitement faded and the price fell to previous levels.  

“By then we had started working with the FBI to investigate these guys, as the misinformation they were spreading was turning into a clear and present danger.”

Garrett was faced with a difficult path to prosecuting the online fraudsters.  “Pump and dump schemes are really fucking hard to prove, and usually it’s only companies and their executives that we’re able to charge,” he explained.  “I was able to compile enough evidence to show that these guys were working together on a daily basis to fabricate some pretty outrageous stories to promote these stocks.  The Attorney General, the FBI Director of White Collar Crimes, and I all worked through everything and decided that they’re organized enough that we can charge them.  Frankly, we’ve never seen such a disturbing amount of false information being spread on such a regular basis - we knew we had to act before it was too late.”  

Garrett’s investigation was given its first big break in September.  A whistleblower from WSB came forward and gave Garrett a series of statements detailing the disturbing secrets from within the organization.  

“I got a call from some kid claiming to know a bunch of pumpers, and as he started explaining everything I realized he was talking about WSB!”

The whistleblower, “John”, (who will remain anonymous as he is in protective custody) gave Garrett valuable insight to the inner workings of WSB.  John was only 15 years old, and had become popular amongst the group after posting photoshopped screenshots of options trades which he claimed to have made.  After receiving massive amounts of encouragement, he secretly gained access to his father’s investment account and began placing real trades while streaming live video for WSB pumpers to watch.  Over the course of a week he lost many thousands of dollars and was banned from WSB as members began to express fear that he was mentally ill.  Soon after, his father discovered John’s trades, and made him contact the SEC to report the scammers.

“I think the kid is going to testify for us,” said Garrett.  “I met his family when we placed them in protective custody, and I swear to God, I’ve never seen parents as angry as his.”  

In early November, Garrett was monitoring the syndicate’s most recent projects, failing biomed companies BG Medicine Inc and Anavex Life Sciences Corp.  Arrests had not been planned until at least Q1 of 2016, but on November 8th he found something that set his task force’s plans into overdrive.  

“I was checking their forum on Sunday morning - my wife hates it, but I’ve been studying these guys so long that it’s automatic - and I damn near spit out my coffee.  Turns out these guys had released dozens of falsified Due Diligence reports on almost as many symbols!  It was horrific!  Ass-backwards analysis of 10Qs, math errors that you wouldn’t think possible, blatant misinterpretation of scientific studies... I can’t believe some of the shit these guys come up with.”

[Side note: Garrett was kind enough to forward me some of these falsified documents, and earlier today I met with hedge fund risk analyst Jim Spencer to ask his opinion of their contents.  Unfortunately, he was unable to give me any meaningful comments, as he burst out laughing while reading the second page and ran off to show his friends in accounting.]

On Monday the 9th, Garrett held an emergency meeting with AG Lynch, SEC Chairman Mary Jo White, and FBI Director James B. Comey to discuss their options in bringing the group down.  In a historic effort, over the course of last week they organized the arrests of the 5,600 members residing in the US.  “Obviously, there are a lot of foreign citizens who participate in the pumps,” explained Garrett.  “We’re still working with various agencies across the world to help bring those people in, but the majority of participants lived in the US so we decided to make our move as soon as possible.”  

Over six hundred local police departments participated in this morning’s operation, with almost every FBI regional office coordinating with local authorities.  “We’re extremely proud of the American law enforcement community today,” Director Comey said in a statement early this afternoon.  “These fifty-six hundred ruthless criminals were arrested in a total of less than twelve minutes.  It took almost no time at all to completely wipe this vile stain on capitalism off of the map.”  

Garrett admitted to me that the rapid planning and execution of the sting was largely possible due to the organization’s poor security measures.  “You’d think a crime syndicate of this size would try to at least mask their IP addresses, but nope, finding them all took less than a day with only a few interns working on it.  Shit, it was almost as if they wanted to be found!”  

Although the Wall Street Bets pumpers are now safely behind bars, the SEC still has many legal hurdles to clear.  In a shocking twist of events, almost half of the perpetrators are under the age of eighteen - presenting a unique challenge to the nation’s juvenile court system, which is largely inexperienced in the prosecution of financial crimes.  Garrett told me that “We’re definitely working to get some of these kids tried as adults, but it’s going to take some time.  For now they’re being held without bail in juvenile detention centers, but basically every lawyer within the SEC is scrambling to get them transferred to their county jails before the parents start suing to get them released.”  

This morning’s arrests weren’t limited to just the pumpers.  Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, co-founders of the discount stock brokerage Robinhood, were brought in for charges relating to the abundance of false identities holding accounts with the company’s trading service.  SEC accountant Adam Schumacher explained to me how Garrett’s investigation had led to the discovery.  

“I got assigned to the WSB operation, tracking down their member’s brokerage accounts to prove that they had participated in the buying and selling of pumped stocks.  It didn’t take me very long to find some massive discrepancies.  Robinhood had over eleven hundred accounts that were registered with false birthdates, which the underaged WSB pumpers used to trade with.  There were another thousand accounts which had been created with the pumper’s parent’s information, but with contact information leading back to the kids.  Robinhood showed criminal negligence in verifying user information, and we’re very excited to bring them to justice.”

“Also, strangely enough,” he added; “a majority of the pumpers only made their purchases once the stock had already risen to all-time highs, and only sold once it had dropped.  In fact, the group made a net loss of over $600,000 throughout the scheme.  No one seemed to care when I pointed it out, though.”

Defense attorneys are already gearing up to fight in what will be one of the largest mass trials of all time.  Charlie Robalino of Bendini, Lambert &amp; Locke told me by phone that they were in talks to represent the group as a whole.  They are currently planning to argue that their clients did not distribute false information knowingly, as they legitimately believed in the companies.  Garrett, however, was unfazed by the defense’s strategy when I asked him about it today.  

“I refuse to believe that anyone could be that stupid.”  

Update: 

The price of Anavex Life Sciences shares fell sharply Monday afternoon, as news of the pumper’s arrests spread.  After rallying to a high of $4.88 in the morning, the last hour of trading saw shares plummet nearly 15% to close at $4.15.  The drop continued into afterhours trading, with share prices sitting at an even $4 at time of publishing.

GOOGL, AMZ, FB etc. - everything would have been a better buy in recent history.

15-11-16,I want to put 1 Million Dollars on Something Tomorrow...Choose for me.,"Yes, I can do it: http://i.imgur.com/wiMyPQe.png

Im an investor, who turned trader, and who is an impatient fuck that sells when I think I'm about to tank and lose, or right when I'm finally getting ahead on a position. Meaning I either take losses I shouldn't (but look scary as fuck on paper to let it go down futher) or break even/make very little when I finally get back, only to see that I should've held.

I got into a little hole, well, a big hole, a 6 digit hole this year. Last time I put 1M into something it tanked 12% after hours on earnings, I panicked and sold, and the next day it opened up 4%. Fuck me.

So now, I leave it in your hands. I want to make this back, and I need to make a good move. A 10-30% move on $1M. I don't know how to trade options, nor do I think I want to.

What do you recommend your YOLO picks are for tomorrow. Give me something with volume, its not worth it to buy or short $1M worth but get fucked because of little volume.

Lets make tomorrow a great day.

EDIT: Im talking a day trade, I want a quick swing. Not trying to leave 1M on margin for more than a day or so.",40

15-11-17,BMY Momentum Stock Play (1-2 Days TOPS),"*Listen you fucks I'm not giving you the A-Okay this is the way to go. Don't give me that shit if you lose your entire portfolio as I might*

So this is a possible momentum play. The past couple days have been promising and I personally missed the kickoff but tomorrow and Friday can be the good days **given the market stays green**. 

There have been rumors of Gilead to acquire this sum'bitch pharm company and BMW has taken off. BMY operates on a global basis funding and buying and manufacturing drugs so your poor ass doesn't get a disease. Keep in mind I am not going into financials because this is a *momentum* play, take your reg loving dick to another thread.

The FDA on Monday granted acceptance for supplemental license application. Another possibility for the outbreak.
**PROS**

The stochastics have crossed over perfectly, RSI indicates not overbought yet, but it could be heading there, and the MACD looks promising to turn green. The past two days have been green and the bulls were pretty strong early afternoon today. 

**CONS**

The CEO declined rumors of a buyout at 3PM today, but it continued its sideways trend and no sudden dip, so investors and traders alike still find this stock appealing. As of right now the stock is up AH. The buyout rumors may not be the only reason the stock is going up.

This play will be very short and may require you to monitor it a little quickly as if bears suddenly come on strong then it's no good.


If anyone wants to look into Level 2 and tell me what the put/call demand ratio is and give me a better idea of how tomorrow might play out I'd appreciate it because I cannot decipher that shit for my life. Thank you.

15-11-17,"Here's the next big problem for Valeant: It paid $1 billion for a 'female viagra' drug nobody is buying","Valeant's female libido pill does not appear to be selling well.
Addyi, the new drug designed to spark sexual desire in women, has been available in the US since October 17.
Between then and November 6, only 227 prescriptions have been written for the pill, Bloomberg's Anna Edney and Laura Colby report.
By contrast, more than half a million people got prescriptions for Viagra in the first month after it went on the market, according to the report.
The female pill — made by Sprout, a unit of Valeant Pharmaceuticals — is laden with controversy. 
For one thing, it comes with serious side effects, including low blood pressure and fainting. It's also expensive.
And it doesn't really do what it's supposed to: When Sprout conducted clinical trials, women only reported a small increase in the number of times they had satisfying sex — around one additional time per month.
Addiyi is Sprout's only product.
Valeant Pharmaceuticals bought Sprout for $1 billion shortly after Addyi got FDA approval.
That company has faced a handful of its own controversies in recent months, including accusations of price gouging and fraud, and its stock has collapsed since September.
Valeant's controversies stem from its business model, which is to load up on debt to acquire a string of companies, and then lift drug prices.
So far, that model has worked for Valeant. But it won't work if the companies Valeant acquires aren't able to sell their product.",283

15-11-17,Do most people lose money in the stock market? (Yes),"According to some analysis, the average investor investing in a mixture of stocks and bonds for the last 10 years has made an annual return of 2.63%. While they are making money, they are barely keeping up with inflation and tremendously underperforming when compared to the objective performance of their investments.

The reason for this is the emotions of an investor observing the market.

When a stock is going up, everyone gets excited. This stock is doing well! I'm going to buy some more of this stock! But the market moves in waves. Eventually some or all of the portfolio will go down. ""This wasn't a good investment after all. I'd better get out."" So they sell.

The investor has bought the stock when it was high and sold it when it was low. This is the natural, emotional way to do things. We are loss averse and attracted to gains, so we buy and sell at exactly the wrong times. This is why so many people lose money when they invest, in spite of the fact that the general trend of the market is up.

Thus ""buying and holding"" is a frequently suggested method of investment. If you buy a diversified portfolio of investments, and then completely ignore them, the general trend of that portfolio will be to rise in value. If you're watching them, trying to call the market, you are probably going to be wrong most of the time, and you will probably lose money. If one is disciplined enough to invest and ignore the investment, I encourage people to do just that. If someone is not disciplined enough to do that, that is just about the only circumstance where I advise them to hire a financial adviser to be disciplined for them.",0

15-11-17,My moves tomorrow and this week. No penny stocks.,"Since I make ballin money almost every day, I decided to help you penny chasers out there so y'all can play with some dime bitches for once. 

1. Buy BBRY Jan 2018 calls. I actually had a ton already at 2017 expiry. When I first talked about BlackBerry here almost 2 months ago, these Jan 2017 8.00 calls were nearly worthless. Everyone also ignored the tip. They're going for $1.20-$1.40 now and I'm up over 300%. I sold most of these last week and this week. Going to get into 2018 calls asap. 

2. If DIS hits 118+ I'm going to buy Jan 2016 110 puts. Unless it's a very fast price move; then I'll wait for stuff to settle. I won't hold these past end of November, though. Too much risk with only 2 months until expiry and Star Wars hype. My plan is to unload when I see a profit of 20% the day of, or 10% this week. If it goes to next week, I'll take any profit. If it goes to the week after, I'm ditching Monday at open. 

3. Conversely, if DIS drops below 113, I'm buying Jan 120 calls. 

4. Buy more SAVE March 2016 40.00 calls. I personally think this airliner is *massively* undervalued and is going to go back up to $60 before Q3 next year. I bought quite a few of these last week and I'm already up (exactly) 35.96%. I would normally get out now with that kind of profit, but I'm holding until next year. 

5. Feel out Macy's a bit longer and buy Jan 2017/2018 OTM calls. Macy's has come back from so much more shit than what's going on right now. They're the largest department store company in the US and are not going away or staying this low forever. 

6. Buy RLYP and sell covered calls at June 2016 expiry, $20 strike price. The premium on these calls is fucking **INSANE**. The underlying shares could drop to $11 and I would still etch out a profit from option price alone.

Laval, Quebec-based Valeant partially uses stock to compensate employees, but shares have fallen more than 70 percent since early August over concerns about its use of a U.S. specialty pharmacy and price spikes for some of its drugs.
About 70 Valeant employees in key positions below the executive level are receiving cash and stock to stay with the company, and Valeant will likely offer the incentives to more U.S. staff in coming weeks, said Laurie Little, head of investor relations. She did not give details.
""In the U.S., definitely there has been some anxiety,"" Little said at a Jefferies investor conference in London. ""Through this turmoil, we definitely don't want to see an exodus.""
Little said employees outside the United States are feeling less pressure because Valeant is known by other names in some countries.
Valeant's previously undisclosed use of a specialty pharmacy, Philidor Rx Services, drew allegations from short-seller Citron Research last month that it was inflating revenues. The company has denied the allegations, but said it would sever ties with Philidor.
Valeant shares on Wednesday climbed 1.5 percent to $71.35 (46.87 pounds) in New York morning trading.",0

15-11-18,"Portfolio review: Merrill Lynch, 1% AUM fee and average expense ratio of 0.73%. Inheriting trust, curious if worth cutting off and switching to lazy three fund.","Hi Reddit!

I'm 25, and coming into a third of what's attached (~$550K). Next two thirds coming at 28 and 30 respectively, I believe.

I've got some limited experience playing around with &lt;$5K in the market, and am planning on taking a $30K set of funds I've saved on my own and dripping that into a 3-fund Vanguard ETF portfolio over a few months using DCA and no-transaction trades at Merrill. I've also got a Roth IRA with ~$17K in it. 

This is theoretically set up as a ""growth"" fund, with 80% equities and 20% fixed (actual numbers).

Performance has been decent, with a realistic growth rate around the 5% range (as you'll note in the cashflow box about $14K/yr has been coming in for a few years as part of a separate trust... complications abound).

It's the typical 1% AUM set up with ML, and I've worked out the simple weighted average expense ratio at 0.73%. 

At any rate my goals are to get some help with a house, perhaps, in 5-6 years; alternatively/additionally I'm hoping to view this as a future child college fund and/or early retirement.

As an aside, I do sorta buy-in to the future being one of lower GDP (and market) growth, at least in the US. I just don't see how a system can continue to grow at the historic rates we've seen in the 20th century. Maybe we stabilize at ~1.5% long term GDP, but I can't see us going much above 2%. Not with climate change and all (addressed or not, either way it's going to lower growth).

Given the uncertainties in the market going forward, wwyd? I understand stock prices are high because TINA, but just staying the course seems like a silly move given the uncertainties ahead.

Also those fees. 

Expecting a good deal of vanguard circle-jerk, but looking forward to the more nuanced replies out there.

Thanks!

I'm interested to hear people's thoughts who have direct experience either working for or with IBM since I don't personally use any of their products or services.

So, to the question. In all the reading I've done, I still have one basic unanswered question. Obviously, owning stock represents ownership of the underlying company. By the very nature of investing and owning all or a portion of a business, the desirability of that stems from the revenue one can gain through ownership.

So with owning a stock that pays dividends, your two sources of revenue are the dividend and the sale of the stock. A stock that does not pay a dividend *(which the rest of this post will focus on)*, one can only gain money by the resale of it.

Now the monetary value is not the only thing that comes with the ownership of stock. Perhaps you gain voting rights at shareholder meetings. But what good is that if you see nothing in return? You're doing free work at that point, spending your time on the company, while gaining nothing in exchange. It seems the only way to cash in on your participation in the company then would be to cash out, thus ending your ability to participate in the company.

Now obviously supply and demand drive the price of the stock. But why is there a demand in the first place? Owning the stock gets you virtually nothing, except the ability to sell it again. It's like trading monopoly-money. ""I'll give you *$x.xx* real dollars for this thing that represents something that has no real value, in the hopes of re-selling it to someone else later at a higher price, to whom it won't bring any real value.""

What am I missing here? Obviously something, but I can't wrap my head around it. I know at the root of it, the desire of owning a non-dividend-paying stock comes from the ability to re-sell it. So really that's what it comes down to. It almost seems like the Beanie Baby craze, without the ~~false~~ artificial scarcity. 

edit: pretty solid answers here, thanks for explaining.",3
15-11-18,The Aspiration Redwood Fund - build value and honor your values. How much of this is hooplah?,"Aspiration recently announced its new [Redwood Fund](https://funds.aspiration.com/redwood/) which ""uses a rigorous analysis of companies’ sustainable environmental, workplace, and governance practices to find investments we believe are poised for growth. ""

I'm not going to touch on the ethical choices of investments, nor the very tree-hugger nature of this whole account. But they make a two claims that I'm curious on if are valid based on your experiences.

* Studies show that companies that adopt significant environmental, employee, and governance policies grow faster than those that do not. $10,000 invested in 1993 in a portfolio of firms with high performance on material sustainability issues is valued at $283,600 versus competitor firms with low performance on material sustainability issues at $144,600. 

* The total volume of sustainable investments nearly doubled from 2012 to 2014. But 89% of this growing class of investments is in the hands of institutional investors, money managers, and community investment institutions. ""Everyday investors have been left on the sidelines.""

Its a cool idea with appeal to value-focused investors. Also the .5% expense ratio, with no fees, and you get to choose how much money Aspiration gets, is pretty cool too. 

But are their financial claims valid?

Sales charge is calculated as a percentage of POP, so as a matter of fact, the total cost is $31.58, the sales charge is $1.58, and the NAV is still at $30.

15-11-18,Analysis of an Early Stage Junior Mining Company,"There was [a post](https://redd.it/3qwzzw) asking for advice on investing in a junior copper miner (Tintina Resources) that owned a single non-operating, undeveloped mine a few weeks ago.  The post was quickly buried.  I wrote a pretty detailed reply to the OP in a discussion that went over a few days.  I went ahead and condensed that discussion into this single post for the benefit of readers here.  I hope you find it useful.  My contribution was mainly associated with mine economics.  Other replies in the original thread did a good job assessing the financial statements.


Disclaimer(s):

Although my discussion is focused on mining, I just want to caution you that I don't consider myself an expert.  This is just a hobby of sorts to me.  Most of my experience is with gold mining but I think much of it can be applied to copper as well.  I also wouldn't recommend most people to invest in mining companies.  They are incredibly risky and are unsuitable for most people here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When analyzing mining companies, before getting into details about the company or the mine, it is important to first research supply\demand issues surrounding the mineral(s).  About 10-15 years ago, Chinese demand for natural resources picked up in order to build new infrastructure for its populace.  This increase in demand has been sustained for several years thereafter.  At the peak of demand for copper, China consumed a significant amount of worlwide production (on the order of ~50% I think but not completely sure about the actual number).  As you may have heard, Chinese commodity demand has sharply fallen off now that most of the infrastructure has been built and China is transitioning to a more consumer oriented economy.  This drop off in demand is affecting copper too.  There currently does not appear to be another country on the horizon that is willing to soak up the copper that the Chinese no longer demand.  Therefore, it appears that the bear market in copper will continue with no significant turnaround in sight.  There does appear to be a small ray of hope.  Consumer appliances use a significant amount of copper so the bear market may be dampened somewhat by this continuing demand.  [This article](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-20/prolonged-commodity-slump-signaled-in-160-years-of-booms-busts) appears to sum up the current consensus view of the copper market situation well.  Antofagasta, a copper miner, presents a slightly less negative view on the copper market in [this article](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-15/copper-seen-near-bottom-by-antofagasta-as-china-absorbs-supply).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now that we have discussed the copper market, let's have a generic discussion on how the price of mining stocks generally change when transitioning from a junior explorer to a producer.  Check out [this post](https://redd.it/3nir8v) I made a while ago that discusses different ways to get exposure to commodities.  As you can see, non-operating mines are only marginally less risky than junior explorers, which are the riskiest mining companies you can invest in.


So what risks is a junior explorer exposed to on the road to becoming a producer?  Check out this image {[Generic Stock Price Change of a Mining Company Transitioning from a Junior Explorer to a Producer](http://imgur.com/PnElRey)} that I found.  I can't offer insight from my own experiences but based on what I have read, mining companies experience share price transitions at similar points in their life cycle.


(1) The first price peak is experienced as soon as the junior explorer drills a promising deposit.

(2) The stock price falls from that peak as soon as the company decides to do a preliminary economic assessment (PEA).  I'm greatly amused by this but it makes sense if you think about it.  When an initial strike is made, there is much risk and uncertainty around the extent of the deposit making it difficult to accurately value the company.  There is a small chance that it could be a huge strike and a greater chance it could be small deposit.  Once the company does the PEA, it will most likely determine that the deposit is not a vast world class deposit thereby determining a more accurate value for the mine with greater certainty.

(3) If the PEA indicates that the deposit is economically viable, a bunch of other studies need to be done (I think environmental happens here too) and permits need to be obtained.  Additionally, financing needs to be obtained (***this is an important\dangerous\risky stage for a shareholder***) to fund the capex to bring the mine into production.  Since a junior miner usually has no operations, they will often raise money by selling more shares thereby diluting existing shareholders.  In a commodities bear market, it can be difficult to obtain financing.  I usually hear this complaint from juniors a lot but I think those with very low cost assets tend to still be ok.  The expenses associated with this stage tend to keep the stock price depressed until it peaks again at...

(4) 1st resource pour!  Mining stocks tend to hit a second peak once the mine initiates production and prepares its first resource for sale.  From here, the price tends to go down again until...

(5) the mine scales production up to the rate it planned in the mine plan.  I have read that many mining companies fail even at this late stage.  I have been following a minng company [Gold Fields Limited (GFI)] that has experienced trouble here.  The old CEO indicated very high production if they bought a certain mine several years ago.  Unfortunately, with falling gold prices, they have yet been unable to bring the mine up to expected production.  I think this issue has been ongoing for at least a few years now for multiple reasons.


Also, feel free to check out [mining company webcasts at the Denver Gold Forum](https://redd.it/3mmujl).  You may be able to get a better idea of what hurdles junior miners are facing trying to bring their assets into production.


Note: Mining companies generally release at least 3 different studies of the mine throughout development: the preliminary economic assessment (PEA), pre-feasability study, and feasability study.  I am not really sure how exactly they differ but each is successively more detailed than the prior one.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ok, so now let's look at our particular company, Tintina Resources.  We are looking at a prospective US copper mine (the US part will matter soon).  The profitability of the mine - and thus, the likelihood of it getting financing and getting built - is dependent on the market price of copper, which is currently $2.09/lb.  Whether our mine is a good investment or not depends on whether it can produce copper at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) below the market price (profit per unit of mined resource is market price - cost of mining a unit).  I don't directly know how the ore grade of a mine translates into AISC but in general, higher grade ores are associated with lower costs.  Another factor which affects the AISC is the currency used to fund the operations of the mine (I'm speaking from experience with gold mining but assuming copper mining works the same way).  The USD has been experiencing a period of relative strength relative to most other foreign currencies.  Foreign mining companies are experiencing falling costs with lower labor costs (labor costs can be a significant part of the operation) and higher realized market prices (the price of most commodities in foreign currencies has not fallen as much as in USD terms).  Unfortunately, our company is a US company.  It will experience higher costs relative to foreign miners.

According to the updated PEA that the company has released in July 2013, the economic viability of the mine has been evaluated under 3 different copper price environments (2.5, 3.05, and 3.5 US$/lb) [See Table 22.2 on page 22-3].  As the chart clearly shows, the mine does not appear to be very profitable @ 2.5$/lb copper (*with the current mine plan), which is even above today's market price for copper.  At the prevailing copper price, it does not appear to be an economically viable deposit (*w/the current mine plan).


***So, my strong recommendation is that you stay very far away from this company***.  Environmental issues should barely be a consideration at this point.  According to the company's own reports, the mine does not even appear to be profitable in the current market environment.  On top of that, it appears that copper prices will only fall more in the near future.  I would not invest a dime in this company at the present time.


&gt; So, what the hell does the * mean?

I've been adding a qualifier to my statements by always bringing up ""with the current mine plan.""  Often times during bear markets, mining companies will re-evaluate an operating mine when the sustained market price of the commodity appears to go below the AISC.  What the company will do is take a look back at the geological assessments of the mine and only look to mine the higher grade ores.  The company will end up writing down (taking an impairment on) the value of assets that are associated with low grade ores, reduce the life of mine (LOM), reduce the AISC, and bring the mine back to profitability.  If you really want to invest in this mine, despite faling demand from China, falling market prices, negative effects from the high USD, and the apparent unprofitably of the mine from the company's own reports, please at least see if the company can determine a revised mine plan (economic assessment\feasability plan, etc. not sure which docs talk about what) that shows that it can mine only the higher grade ores profitably.


Ok, I hope this post helped.  I wish you best of luck in your decision.

Some random questions answered from throughout the original thread.


&gt; Also, the price of this mineral has gone down historically, so I am trying to hedge my bet by investing in a mining company rather than purchasing the mineral outright on the market.


Check out [my other reddit post](https://redd.it/3nir8v).  Mining companies are usually (always?) more risky than buying the asset outright.  You are not hedging at all.  You are taking on more risk.


&gt; I can read and understand the scientific literature associated with this company, and it's all legit, which leads me to speculate that this mine will go through.


You can read it but are you sure they are not being overly optimistic? or even worse, outright lying (Read up on Bre-X)?  I am not sure which literature you are talking about but I don't really understand all of the geology reports all that well.  Mining (especially gold) tends to be a slimy business.  You may want to take a look at Glenn Chan's [blog](https://glennchan.wordpress.com/).  He talks a lot about (mostly bashes) the mining industry.  You may be able to learn some stuff from there.  He has mentioned that it is not uncommon for the resource reports to be inflated.  As I mentioned earlier, I usually try to avoid pre-production companies because I can't value them well.


Also, feel free to check out [mining company webcasts at the Denver Gold Forum](https://redd.it/3mmujl).  You may be able to get a better idea of what hurdles junior miners are facing trying to bring their assets into production.


&gt; What about the growing demands for alternative energy, which use sizeable amounts of copper (4-5 tons per megawatt of wind power)? I was vaguely aware of copper prices, but am no expert in minerals.


I don't know how wind power demand will affect copper demand.  I think wind power is even growing quickly right now but the growth is not enough to keep the copper prices high that is why they keep dropping.  I would not consider myself a mineral expert either.  My knowledge of the copper market is mostly formed from reading different articles and some company webcasts.


&gt; I did also notice that no copper would even make it to the market until 2020, and was hoping to be able to hold out until then.


I think a new perspective on mining is needed to understand how investing in this sector works.  Although the company does not expect the mine to go into production for another 4/5 years, the decision to finance and build the mine needs to be made today using today's market price.  Building a mine is expensive, even more so with underground mines than surface mines.  When the company goes out to seek financing today,  It will have a difficult time raising enough money to build a mine that is unprofitable today with an uncertain future market price.   I don't even see how the mine will be built today to have it prepared to go into production in 5 years under current market conditions.  I suggest reading [this short article](http://www.growthstockwire.com/2929/How-to-Master-the-Booms-and-Busts-of-the-Resource-Sector) on commodity market boom/bust cycles.


As I mentioned in the previous response, if you have contact with the people who run the company or a competent, honest geologist, try to find out whether a viable mine plan can be made focusing on only the higher grade ores.  That is the key to determining whether this company will succeed.  However, be cautious if they start parroting optimistic forecasts without any substance.


I personally don't think this mine will go any where in the near future.  I watched their promotional video on the web site.  The geology of this area has been known since the 80s.  Why has a company only recently been formed to tap these deposits?  I think the answer is that the copper market price has only recently (recently being the last several years) risen enough to render the deposit viable.  Now that the market price has fallen again, I don't see this mine being built until the copper market price rises sustainably.",34

15-11-18,For something different: $SRSC Long idea with set profit target and stop loss,"In a previous post I said the following:

""....I believe the only way to make money is to take positions at points where the risk-to-reward ratio is skewed. If I told you that in a coin toss, with heads you win $3000 and tails you lose $1000, how long would you want to keep playing that game? Forever. As a matter of fact, under those payoffs, you could be right only 35% of the time and still make a great deal of money. Well this is the way I think about trading.
To skew the payoff in my favor like this, I look for stocks that are reaching new highs, with the idea that objects in motion tend to stay in motion (ESPECIALLY after being in a directionless consolidating pattern. The longer the consolidation the better).
The second thing that puts odds further in ones favor that is not talked about nearly enough is volume. If the breakout is not accompanied by at least 3X the average trading volume, then I am not interested.
There is more to it than simply the new high/volume requirement, but these two pieces are foundational in tipping the risk reward in ones favor.""

I'm interested in buying a small amount of bitcoins and holding them for 10-20 years.

1. Actually buying and holding onto bitcoins - I believe this traditionally happens via an online transaction, and the coins are held in some sort of digital wallet.  From what I have read the wallet is actual files on your local computer and if you lose it, it's gone. If someone hacks and steals out of it, it's gone. Where are the actual coins purchased? Is there a best place to buy from that is very secure and legit/fair or are all the vendors the same?

2. Are there any ETFs that are a good option?  Like GLD for gold, which I vastly prefer to real physical gold.  I have heard of GBTC, and COIN (which I think is not launched yet)

3. From what I understand bitcoin's real value is in its potential as a platform for apps and other services to be built on top of. That's exciting, but bitcoin has been around for years and I have yet to hear of anyone actually using it, other than in articles about bitcoin.  Is there any evidence of bitcoin getting wider adoption or growth in upcoming projects using bitcoin?  Appreciate any insight or links!

15-11-19,"How would you value AT&amp;T? (what do you come up with for stock price?)","It seems there are many different methods of coming up with a firms valuation. I was curious as to what others have come up with when valuing a company and the different inputs they used for their calculations. 

I would like to use this as a learning opportunity. 

With controversy (as I have seen on these boards), I don't use a market risk premium. Instead I simply use the risk-free rate of a long-term US bond in a normal interest rate environment. I use 6% and believe that to compensate for the lack of a market risk premium that I can simply use a larger margin of safety when purchasing the stock. In addition to that, I use conservative estimates in my inputs. Some call this crazy but this is a method I pulled straight out of page 66 in ""The Warren Buffett Way"". Do I use this in real life? Nope...half of my portfolio is in index funds. The other is in stocks individually chosen but for different reasons. I would like to start using more complicated methods for stock picking rather then short-handed ones but I am still learning many things.

For AT&amp;T, I came up with an intrinsic value of $30.48 which is pretty close to this company's stock price of $33.54 at the time of this post. 

This is an image of my calculation. I used a two stage dividend discount model. For high growth rate I used 4% which is close to analyst estimates on Nasdaq.com then I just slashed that in half and used 2% for stable growth rate.

B) Their leader is a Marvin Milktoast whimp who needs to give his buddies 'a little time' with revolutionary new trading technology for stealing money.

15-11-18,"Is Bitcoin (etc) a threat to Visa, American Express and MasterCard whether they get on the bandwagon or not?"," I recently attended a business conference where our keynote speaker was one of the guys from the singularity Institute, basically a futurist. When discussing bit coins and block chain technology in general, it started to occur to me that the business of payments processing  May be at risk, whether they adopt the technology or not. The reason I think this is that the transaction fees that visa etc.  Currently enjoy are in the neighborhood of 2 to 4% whereas the transaction fees for a block chain related transactions such as one with bitcoin are well under 1%. It's looking like the payments processing middleman and his business may be severely diminished in the future.

Especially with the birth of technology such as Apple wallet, in the future there may not be any reason for visa to even be involved except for from a branding/pre-existing business standpoint. Even then, and I think this will be the case,  Visa et al's  revenues appear to be at risk. I haven't found many other discussions online in this vein and wanted to hear if you guys had any feedback about it,  preferably feedback that is neutral and objective with regards to both traditional payment systems and bitcoin.

We have decided to invest about 60% of our savings and want to invest a good portion of it in Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index fund.  However, this is our first foray into investing (with the exception of our 401ks and IRAs) - so please forgive me if these are stupid questions.  

I see that the fund has three options:

VTSAX: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares
              Expense Ratio: 0.05%
VTSMX: Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Investor Shares
               Expense Ratio: 0.17%
VTI:      Vanguard Total Stock Market Index ETF
             Expense Ratio: 0.05%


We have enough to qualify for the admiral shares - so we had planned on investing in VTSX or VTI.  We plan on keeping the money in the market for the foreseeable future (hopefully well into our retirement years) and we plan to contribute to it monthly.  Is there an advantage in that situation in buying one versus the other?

Is the VTSAX actively managed versus the ETF?

If they are virtually the same funds, why is VTI trading around 107 and VTSAX trading around 52?

15-11-19,Google Search starts indexing and letting users stream Android apps without matching web content,"Until now, Google has only indexed apps that have matching web content, meaning you could always find a corresponding website with the same information. Now, the company is going after content that lives primarily in apps (it doesn’t exist online or it provides a poor user experience). Today’s debut begins with just nine apps: Hotel Tonight, Weather, Chimani, Gormey, My Horoscope, Visual Anatomy Free, Useful Knots, Daily Horoscope, and New York Subway.

Additionally, if you don’t have a given app installed, Google will now let you stream content — as long as you’re on a reliable Wi-Fi connection. That means you don’t have to install the app to get the information you’re looking for.

In fact, you can even accomplish tasks like booking a hotel room without installing the app. When these apps show up in search results, they are accompanied with a Stream button. Tapping it takes you into a streamed version that you can interact with as if you had the app on your phone. Android Lollipop is required, tablets are not yet supported, and the search has to be conducted through Google (streaming won’t work through Google’s mobile site).

This is a big play from Google, as it could fundamentally change how searching for in-app content works on mobile devices.

I just read the intelligent asset allocator which focuses on modern portfolio theory as a method of getting good returns ... fantastic all makes sence. Then I can across the next step, tax sheltered investing, and everything just got alot more complicated. Have a couple of questions about this for those more experienced... 

First a very dumb simple question... all the sources im reading talk about what assets to hold in what accounts. I am thinking about buying vaguard ETF assets... Does that mean in order to shelter tax income from investments in vanguard ETFs i would have to buy them with money in a tax sheltered account from a bank (eg. SIPP or ISA), ie. I dont have a private vanguard account i transfer money to or anything like that? 

Am I right in assuming that the only methods in the UK for tax sheltered investing are to use ISA accounts or a personal pension plan (which can either be a company based pension or a SIPP)? I imagine this is a bad idea (I can appreciate that tax efficient investing is very important) but I feel like avoiding personal pension plans as they prevent me from accessing the funds until im much older... and the whole idea is i would like to retire as early as possible. Another reason is because i dont trust politicians... they can at any time change retirement law and influence my access to my money.",2

Products on the market: Last week, BioPharmX announced that they are more than doubling their retail footprint for their breast health supplement, Violet® iodine, which will be available in over 3,000 GNC stores nationwide.


Violet® iodine is the first of it's kind on the market and relieves pain in the breasts commonly associated with fibrocystic breast condition. The supplement is also available at CVS, the Vitamin Shoppe, and online at walgreens dot com.


It turns out fibrocystic breast condition is extremely common among women when on their menstrual cycles. This coupled with the ease of access to the drug (OTC) makes it very intriguing to me.

15-11-19,$CTXS DD - Swing Play,"Doing some research, I ran across CTXS (Citrix Systems) last night. SP dropped from ~$76 to $70.50 yesterday on news of them spinning off their ""GoTo"" brands into a separate company. This includes products such as GoToMeeting and GoToMyPC. They are also actively terminating products that dont fit with their core offerings. With this they also announced a layoff of ~1000 full time and contract employees. I think this is where the sell off came from. I see this as an over reaction. After a quick look at the last few quarters they have beat estimates with up side surprises the last 2. They have also increased EPS YoY for the last 3 years. The measures they are taking right now will only increase that. I haven't done a deep dive on the 10q but things look positive from what I can see with the limited fundamentals I've looked at. Please do your own DD on this.

As far as TA goes, the indicator that lead me to this is the fact that it closed way under its lower bollinger band (10 days, 1.5 SD) yesterday. If it opens below the lower BB and has an upward trend, chances are its going to continue back towards a normal SP. I could see a $3-$4 move happen in the next week if we get an upward trend going. TTM Squeeze is showing consolidation over night at the SP it dropped to early yesterday. Momentum is down but I think thats just due to low volume. At close, volume was way up (almost double the high for the day at that point) while the TTM squeeze showed it was going into consolidation. That tells me there were buyers coming in. I'll likely use the momentum indicator to jump in before TTM squeeze or candles give me a strong signal. 

Anyway, just thought I'd throw that out there. As always do your own DD. I could be completely wrong on this. I dont own any CTXS right now but plan on jumping in today if it looks like its going to bounce back.

15-11-19,$KBIO -- Informal DD,"TL;DR: KBIO goes crazy high after hours after being purchased by Martin Shkreli.  Good buy under $4 and possibly $10 (read the DD to find out which), stay away over that (but is a risky short).

-

Infamous Biotech exploiter, AVXL shorter, and /u/wallstreetbets mod /u/martinshkreli has decided to do a [form-4 purchase](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1293310/000114420415066696/xslF345X03/v425127_4.xml)  1,211,115 of KBIO’s 4,124,379 float (~30%) and the stock is going crazy after hours.  His “group” [bought the remaining 25%](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/kalobios-confirms-communications-majority-shareholder-002700572.html).   Martin got his shares for less than $2.   The question for us is if there is still a play here?

-

I was going to do a proper DD on this company until I found out a majority stake had been purchased.   Now that the company is private I can only speculate on its future.  So here is the skinny.   This company has one p2 trial in progress (not fully enrolled) and one drug that is ready for a p1 trial.  The p2 trial has not had any results released although the P1 trial showed promising activity.   This company is YEARS away from any possible revenue.

-

So the question becomes why did Martin buy this company?  I personally believe this is a Gordon Gekko style raid (and I’m not the only one as shares of biotechs trading under cash value have seen overnight increases in their share price -- looking at you $SGNL).   In June this company had 24m in assets and 14m in liabilities.   That is a cash on hand value of 10m.  With only 4.5m shares this company’s valuation was $2.22 which is above Martin’s purchase price.

-

Once you factor in a few million to sell off the company’s pipeline (maybe to one of Martin’s biotechs, maybe to someone else) this stock is worth between $3-$8 a share.

-

Since I believe this company will cease to exist as it does now in the coming months I’m not going to do a DD because it’s not a long term play.   I believe there is an opportunity to short the shares tomorrow morning but don’t feel confident in that analysis to recommend that play with real money given that there are other scenarios beyond liquidation.

-

I’d like to add that /u/Simon_Inaki initially believed this may be turned into a tax shell which means it would continue on as an entity and Martin will just create and buy some preferred shares to fund the company (whether you retail folk like it or not because he owns the company).  In this scenario the company, to retail, is worth less than $2 (my option) until we start to see some of the p2 results, or he starts using the company to research other blood candidates and we can judge if the risk of being a minority owner is worth the potential of the pipeline.  If you are an investor this is the worst short term scenario but potentially the best long term.

Simon also pointed out [a tweet](https://twitter.com/adamfeuerstein/status/667164947663704064) by infamous AVXL short Adam Feuerstein: ""Just my hunch, but Martin and his investors know conventional IPO for Turing can't happen, so merger into $KBIO shell is best option.""  ~~Since it's impossible to value this type of reverse merger at this point, I'd still hold to a &lt; $4 entry point until this speculation and its impacts can be properly assessed.~~

-

**EDIT** The guys on [Surge Chat](https://surgetraders.typeform.com/to/f8Q97D) figured out that under Feurerstein's scenario, a fair valuation of KBIO+Turing would equate to roughly $23/share.   If you believe this is the most likely scenario, look for a good entry below this value (around $10), however do be aware of the risks of liquidation.

-

**EDIT** The reverse merger for Turing looks to be the most likely scenario after further review.  Appropriate edits have been made elsewhere in this document.  Basically Martin got the company for almost free thanks to the surplus cash on hand and can now take Turing public without the hurdles and challenges of an IPO.  Bravo and Kudos Sir Shkreli. &lt;/edit&gt;

-

If you were in a shorting group you are screwed and [this is an object lesson](https://twitter.com/InkedTrader/status/667151040609914880) that shorting has infinite risk, ~~but holding through might let you salvage something~~.   If you’re /u/martinshkreli you’re proof that if you have enough money it’s easy to make money.   If you’re a typical wall street better, stay away from this stock ~~unless it falls below $4~~ unless you really want to YOLO on Turing+FBIO being worth $23/sh.",27

And each time there are 40 or more of the 50 stocks on sells, it’s time to sit up and take notice since that is the number that most often signals either the bottom or the beginning of a bottom on each down swing.

This is just FYI, but it is what market timing and swing trading are all about, and the results can be quite remarkable.  For instance, the last 40-plus sell day was November 13th for a buy on open of the 14th.  On that buy signal, among the leveraged ETFs  TQQQ is up 10.6% (tracking the Nasdaq), TNA up 6.6% tracking the Russell), and UPRO up 10.7% (tracking the S&amp;P 500).

Leveraged sector ETFs include ERX up 12.1% in energy, BIB up 10.7% in biotech, and FAS up 8.6 tracking financials.

Notable stocks on the same signal – AAPL up 4.7%, BIDU up 6.3%, and NFLX up an amazing 15.8%.

15-11-18,Correct cost basis for a fractional spinoff?,"Has anyone seen any official IRS publication (or other convincing source) on the correct way to compute tax basis for multiple lots in a fractional spinoff?  
  
Recently I have been hit by a few of these and the way Merrill Edge computes cost basis is both implausible and to my disadvantage (will result in slightly higher capital gains taxes).  
  
Consider Multiple lots of DRI, some of which lots are not divisible by 3, receiving one FCPT shares for every 3 DRI shares.  Example, lots of 20, 20, and 24 shares, total 84 shares DRI receiving 21 shares FCPT.  Merrill computes that as 7 shares in each of three lots of FCPT, so even though the third DRI lot is divisible by 3, it loses a share of FCPT.  Then Merrill distributes the cost basis in a bizarre way leaving the total basis of {the 3 remaining lots of DRI plus 3 lots of FCPT plus the cost basis connected to the cash in lieu} less than the total of the 3 starting lots of DRI, so I will pay capital gains tax someday on a (tiny) amount of imaginary gains.  
  
Is all this done based on some (typically stockholder unfriendly) IRS formula documented somewhere?  Or is Merrill Edge just sloppy?  
  
I understand there is no reasonable way to distribute the basis.  A mathematician would say I ended up with 6.5 shares in each of the first two lots of FCPT and 8 shares in the third and the cash in lieu represented 1/6 of a share from each of the first two lots and none from the third.  But then when I sold some, it would get messy yet again, since I can't sell a 6.5 share lot.  So I understand accounting is intentionally sloppier than math on the spinoff transaction in order to be less messy on the subsequent transactions.  But does it need to be so sloppy that it is this wrong?  
  
BTW, the 20, 20, and 24 were for purposes of illustration of which lots were divisible by 3 and were not my actual holdings of DRI, and this whole thing also happened in another stock recently  before DRI and seems to be ready to happen in yet another this week.

In a statement sent to the project's backers and republished by Ars Technica, the company said it had ""made the difficult decision to pursue a creditors' voluntary liquidation."" It noted: ""We are greatly disappointed with the outcome of the Zano project and we would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has supported us during this difficult period, especially our loyal employees whose commitment has exceeded all expectations.""",8

15-11-19,SQUARE up 50%.,"The indicated price had given the company a valuation of nearly $3 billion, half of where it was priced at its most recent private-financing round.
At that time, it raised $150 million at $15.50 per share.
It was already a bumpy start to the company's public debut. Still, it was one of the biggest public offerings of the year and will be closely watched as private tech startup valuations continue to soar.
It's not common for tech companies to price their IPOs below their worth at the preceding private-funding round.
Some analysts have suggested the lowered valuation happened, in part, out of concern about CEO Jack Dorsey, who returned to the helm of Twitter in October.",18

Long story short, my trading account was inactive for a long time. We're talking like, since 2006. My father had an account setup for me and only has recently been transferred to me (I did not purposely leave it for this long, so I don't need a lesson on that). I have 300 shares in ERF and I'm down around 60% on it (loss of around $3200). It's not a large portion of my portfolio on the plus side, so I am willing to take some risk. At this point, do you think it's worth keeping ERF hoping oil prices make a comeback, or sell it. It does have its pros in dividend payments and potential to recover, but I'm not a fan of energy companies really and am hoping to sell it so I can reinvest in other companies that have been performing well in my portfolio.

TL;DR   ERF is hella red (-60%) and its hurting my eyes. Sell and reinvest, or keep it while oil prices are down and hope for a recovery in the price before selling?",1

15-11-19,WTW Strangle Play,"This is a play I was recently thinking of entering. I'm just posting for feedback and opinions.

For Weight Watchers (WTW): *Buy March 2016 $30 Call* and *Buy March 2016 $20 Put*

My reasoning for this is that I'm bullish on volatility. The deal with Oprah has pushed the price from near 52-week lows to near 52-week highs, so the price is pretty unstable as is. It just jumped up another 11% yesterday.

 Furthermore, the partnership is set to rebrand the company and its business model in December. Before the partnership, WTW had been floundering. Oprah *may* be able to turn it around - at least, she is expected to. The success of this revitalization of the brand with Oprah at its head will come to light in late Feb. 2016, when the next earnings report is expected. If the new plan succeeds I expect stock will rise decently, if not, it may fall to earlier levels.

So, that's my play. Any critiques or comments?

I've been trading for about 2 years. I am more of a long term holder and have managed to recover from my first year blunders. I started out with $600 to get my feet wet and managed to to grow it to just over $2,000, then bought some Radio Shack stock and well... we all know how that turned out. I have not contributed more to my account, but plan to do so in the future.

Currently I'm creeping back to the 2k mark but wanted some tips on when to sell a stock. I've read a book on stocks, and understand that you should always set up your goals in respect to your purchases, stop limits, etc. However, I currently have 60 shares of IDTI which I purchased at $19.80. Its currently at 27.4X. I typically dont get out of a good stock unless I see an opportunity.

How do you guys go about letting go of stocks that are performing well?

At a biotech industry convention in June 2014, Shkreli—again, the chief executive of a public company—tweeted that there were lots of “BIObabes” at the meeting and invited them to drop by the Retrophin booth. About the same time, three Twitter accounts began sending out messages praising Retrophin using language mimicking rappers, with sort-of-words like “sukka ass fooos.” The IP address for those accounts traced back to Retrophil, according to a person connected to the company. An article in thestreet.com, which first reported the existence of the bogus twitter accounts, said that they had been controlled by more than one Retrophil employee.""

The scale of the operation reported is astonishing. The report suggests 410 billion yuan ($64 billion, £42 billion) in foreign exchange transactions were made by the unnamed illegal organisation. 370 people have reportedly been arrested.

China's currency is tightly regulated by the government, so even multinational firms have struggled with large foreign exchange deals. An underground bank effectively smuggles money in and out of China for investors.",531

I'm currently putting $460/month into my Fidelity account through automatic deposits. I'm currently invested in FBIOX and SPY. I was considering just setting up automatic investments of $200/month each in FBIOX and IVV (instead of SPY since there is no commission fee). Then I'd just let the extra $60/month grow as cash in case later down the road I want to add to my portfolio.

My thinking behind this strategy is to invest in FBIOX for its potential higher returns in the distant future, then investing in IVV as a safer long-term investment.

Does this strategy make sense or would it still be better to just look into a target date fund? I don't want to be completely hands off but I'd like to keep my portfolio relatively simple.

One percent per day would turn $175,000 into $2.3 million in just one year of trading!

15-11-20,What are your thoughts on agriculture stocks? Anyone buying?,"These are the four I've been looking at recently. 

ADM is getting pummeled after missing earnings - mainly driven by low ethanol margins which is driven by oversupply.  They could potentially exit that in the future and focus on other markets. Their payout ratio is below 50% and are yield &gt;3% right now with a sustainable business model that shouldn't put the dividend at risk. They've increased their dividend 39 yrs in a row and people will always need corn/seed processing so I doubt that changes any time soon. However, short term pressure on the stock will be there and I'm not sure it's over - I could see it continue to sink down even in the high 20s. 

AGU is another good one - diversified with a solid business model - good recent dividend increases and a sustainable payout ratio. I would still like this to drop a bit more before I buy in. 

MOS/POT are in the same business but are more potash driven than AGU so the recent decrease in prices has hurt them a lot more. There's a lot of oversupply there but I think that changes eventually as production ramps down a bit when margins are squeezed. MOS has a better balance sheet and more safety in their dividend as their payout ratio isn't above 50%. 

POT is yielding a ton but their payout ratio is pretty high and I think there's still some pain in Potash pricing so I wouldn't be surprised if they cut their dividend despite saying they're committed to it. 

I think these aren't short term plays as I could easily see bad earnings for the next couple of quarters due to ethanol/potash prices continuing to drop but some of these guys(esp ADM and AGU) look like really solid long term plays. ",5

I recently watched two Youtube videos:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgVg4hv10YM

These really got me interested in purchasing some of these 500 S&amp;P index ETF. I was browsing the Canadian site for Vanguard looking at what ETF's they have available and I'm somewhat lost (https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/individual/etfs/etfs.htm).

I guess my question is how do I decide which one I'm supposed to buy? I realize that the VFV and VSP stock both say 500 S&amp;P on them but I have no idea what differentiates them. And maybe one of the other stocks is actually the better option but I just don't know how to see that.

I was looking at Questtrade and I noticed they had commission free ETF purchases so I guess once I pick one out I can just start purchasing them and then adding monthly payments to grow the amount of stock I own. 

I feel like this question is all over the place so I apologize in advance, but I was also wondering how do I make money off this? I realize that they have some sort of a return on your investment. Then I guess you can just take out/put in as much money as you want any time you want? Is that how it works?

BTW I'm 21 and yes I realize I may sound like an idiot/novice so I apologize if I made some of you more knowledgeable investors cringe.

15-11-20,A question on dividends,"Hello all,

This is my first post ever on reddit, though I've been reading for years. I come to you for informarion. Some background information on me, I work at a large international investment firm as a broker and am currently studying to earn the CFA charter. 

I have asked this question to numerous coworkers and through countless searches online and am unable to achieve a satisfactory answer. 

And so, the question I propose is the following:

Why are dividends beneficial?

It sounds simole, yes. But in reality, my issue is more complex. You see, on the ex-dividend date, the exchanges will automatically drop the market price of the stock by the exact amount of the quarterly dividend. This drop does not show up as, say, a negative 1.5% upon market open. It will simply open at the new, lowered price. Many retail investors are unaware of this fact. 

For example, say we have XYZ stock which pays an annual dividend of 4%, or a quarterly dividend of $1. Not bad.  Let's put the ex-date on 11/21/2015. On 11/20/2015, the stock closes at $100. You have 10 shares for a total value of $1000. On 11/21, the stock opens at $99 due to paying the dividend (again, it is not showing red or green, it simply opens at this price). Your stock position is now worth 10 x $99 = $990. However, you have received 10 x $1 = $10 in dividends. Total portfolio value is unchanged, at $1000. Where is the benefit? 

To further this notion, if this occurs in a nonretirement account, the IRS will tax you on that dividend, whether you take it as cash or reinvest it. So, at the end of the year you will owe about $1.50 (give or take) for that one quarterly dividend of $10. So, to simplify, let us assume your position doesn't change. Your total value is now decreased to $998.50. 

I have heard the argument that as stocks fall, dividends make a nice buffer. Or that the dividends increase annual returns. I disagree, since had those dividends not paid, the stock price would be that much higher, whether the stock falls or rises. 

I want to appreciate dividends, but at the moment I cannot make sense of the attraction. If someone could provide a concrete answer to this dilemma I would be very appreciative, as would any clients who ask for my opinion on the matter.

I know your time is valuable so I thank you for the anticipated consideration.",6

That's a pretty high price for a startup that launched in 2012 with about 200 employees, according to its LinkedIn profile.
Scuttlebutt is that Cisco got into a bidding war to buy the startup. The person we talked to didn't know who else was after Acano, though Microsoft's name was kicked around. 
Plus, it turns out that there's a long history between Cisco and the CEO cofounder of Acano (OJ ""Odd Johnny"" Winge), and the founder of another competitor, Pexip (Simen Teigre).

(or the bond market in general)  Ideally, I hope the price dips down a few %'s on the news, and then recovers in the coming day's/weeks.  Or, would it be logical to expect BND to continue to track downward in the coming years as interest rates continue to rise?",34

15-11-20,Spinal Co w/FDA coming -- DD closed early -- failed/toxic,"When I did my DD for [the spinal company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3lkpme/amda_dd_nasdaq_noncompliant_436_3mo_play_80150/?) the float was 65,758,131.   They were in the process of an equity fund raising so my FDA price targets were conservatively below $1.  What I missed was a clause in the warrants which allowed for the issuance of more shares if the price fell after they were issued.  The ""Adjustment Period""

And that's exactly what happened.  A flood of new shares hit the market in November and the warrant holder basically doubled the shares he got because the price fell more than 50%.

The bad news is that this was the ""B"" warrants.   The ""C"" warrants hit on December 16.  The owner may not do the same thing this time, he may actually pump the stock and let it rise then drag it back down again for more shares.  He may just hold.  He may just dump.  Since the owner has incentive to savage the share price, I'm labeling the stock toxic.

When everything is said and done this stock will have a float of nearly 200m shares.   A $1 stock price would give this company a $200m valuation and that is not going to happen.   A $.50 stock price would give this company a $100m valuation and that is probably not going to happen.   $.25 would be a decent share price after FDA.  While this is a pretty nice return if you purchased the stock for a dime, given the warrant holder's callus disregard for share price, if there are a flood of buyers come FDA there is also a huge risk for a flood of shares.

So because of the truly massive dilution, because of the risk of further tsunamis of shares hitting the market, no price targets are expected to hit and this stock is toxic until at least the end of December.

--------------------------

Additionally, in other news, BNHLF is also being closed early as partial success since it recommended avoiding playing the committee recommendation.  Since the committee recommended against FDA approval the overall risk is now quite high so it's best just to let that one go.

I am 25 years old work a corporate job (95k + bonuses) and decided to get into the stock market after I have had saved a significant amount of money in order to avoid the transaction fees by making all my trades during the ""new"" account phase. 

Snapshot: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/6FaBEvE.png)

**Story:**

Faith have it, I created my account did all my research and executed my orders a few weeks prior to the market correction that occurred in August. During my research I learned about Dollar Value Investing and since the correction applied to the market as a whole I figured all my picks were still solid company foundations and by adding another 10k into my positions I can speed up the recovery time. 


Fast forward to today my portfolio sits at about -2.00%. My positions are all over the place in terms of returns. Looking at my portfolio most of my picks have bounced back while some gaining traction slowly. There is however the infamous on Reddit GoPro and AMBA combo in my portfolio which is dragging me down. Every time I thought about executing the sale on my GoPro I thought hmm this is the lowest it will go and it will bounce soon surely...Well that has yet to occur. 

**Question for my fellow Redditors:**

Should I sell my winners and reinvest into my slow to gain traction stocks now such as FL, AMBA, and CI or wait until March?

15-11-21,Startup to connect investors with opportunities? Ideas?,"So we are sitting here at the Phoenix Startup Weekend, trying to solve the problem of people who want to put their money to work, but have no idea how. What we are looking to build is a platform that connects people with idle money with people with investment opportunities.

It would more or less be a gallery of potential investments, with the focus being on the track record of success of the poster(person presenting the opportunity).

[This dude](https://phoenix.craigslist.org/evl/bfs/5245618574.html) is our perfect candidate: he is able to identify opportunity, has a track record of success, and needs money.

The focus here is helping people getting people with about 10-40k in savings to put their money to work, by connecting them with people who have solid opportunities. And by opportunities we mostly mean the flipping of hard assets, as opposed to the funding of projects/businesses.

15-11-21,"Yahoo's board suddenly has a big, looming problem and it could mean the end of Marissa Mayer","On Thursday, activist hedge fund Starboard Value wrote a letter to Yahoo's board arguing that it shouldn't pursue its planned spin-off of a 15% stake in Alibaba but should instead spin out the company's core business.

Starboard's argument, in short, is that Yahoo's planned spin-off is simply too risky and no longer has shareholder support. As a result, Starboard believes Yahoo must change its strategic direction.

In a conversation Friday morning, Peck told Business Insider that indications from Starboard's letter are pretty clear: Starboard will seek some sort of board representation, or perhaps nominate an entirely new slate of directors, if the board remains unresponsive to their suggestions.

As it currently stands, no indications from Yahoo have suggested the company is rethinking its Alibaba spin-off plan.

One Yahoo investor told us that the board and Yahoo's management team appear not to be thinking about this as owners of the company — and therefore stewards of shareholder capital — but as a management team that simply wants to keep itself in place.

In other words, this investor sees Yahoo's board in something resembling self-preservation mode rather than acting in the best interests of the company over the long term.

This is a great piece from Investor's Field Guide (the blog's author is the son of James O'Shaughnessy), where he breaks the base rate argument down better than I could, at 1/8th the length

http://investorfieldguide.com/fun-with-f-a-n-g/

Here's the relevant part, for those playing at home:

&gt; Let’s assume:
(1) **That each company’s market cap grows by 7% per year for the next 10 years (roughly the market’s historical growth rate).** 7% for 10 years leads to a doubling of market cap. (2) That in 10 years, **they each trade for 21.9X trailing 12-month earnings,** which is the current multiple on the S&amp;P 500...


&gt; Let’s take Amazon as the best example. It’s trailing 1-year earnings as of 10/31/2015 were $328MM. Its market cap was $293B. So if it doubles in the next ten years, to nearly $600B in market cap, and trades at 21.9x earnings, that means it will have to **grow its earnings at 55% PER YEAR** for **10** years. That is *possible* but highly *improbable*. I looked back to 1973 and found that a small percentage of companies **(0.28% of them)** did grow earnings at that rate for 10 years (many off of a much smaller base than Amazon). 

Since 1973, less than 1% of all companies have grown their earnings as fast as AMZN would have to in order to justify it at a market multiple a decade down the road. 

That's the ""base rate."" You wouldn't bet the farm (or any meaningful amount of capital) on something that had a less than 1% chance of success, right?

Of course, if you disagree with this over all assessment, the next question is: why? Is AMZN **STILL** not going to be a ""mature"" company with a mature P/E in 10 years? Iirc the average Fortune 500 company exists for approx. 40 years, so AMZN would be 3/4 of the way towards expiration by 2025. I think that it deserves a mature multiple then.

To summarize, as the author did:

&gt; Will Amazon be the next company to grow that fast? Could be. But based on the outside view, the odds are about 9 times worse than hitting a random number in roulette.

Be smart: Go for Red.

I'm thinking about investing about $50,000 in Betterment (index funds) all at one time in the next month or so. This money will be designated for retirement which is still about 30 years away for me. 

I have this belief that if I invest this money and the market dives a bunch, corrects, then I'll have lost a lot based on the 50,000 and it doesn't matter what my dividends are until the share price matches the point at which I bought in. 

I have this feeling the market is in for a correction and I should wait before buying. It could be a year away or more and I should wait. If I buy and it does go down substantially, I'll be out, maybe a large amount of money compared to gaining a little bit with dividends.

15-11-22,Would this trading tax loop hole work?,"Pretty straight forward idea. Assume 150k short term capital gain taxed at marginal 35% rate. Can we convert this to 15-20% rate by trading into and out of dividend stocks the day before ex dividend? 

Example: Johnson and Johnson is going ex dividend tomorrow and will pay out 1% dividend. We buy 2m worth of JNJ on margin and sell the next day. Assuming market is flat JNJ will trade 1% lower on ex dividend day to account for the dividend and we take a 1% capital loss (offsets our capita gain) and essentially converts our high taxes short capital gains into advantages dividends. This trade leads to capital loss of 20k but dividend of 20k (assuming flat market). Do this 7.5 times and 150k short term gain at 35% tax rate becomes 150k dividend at max 20% tax rate. 

Would this work? Obviously market could open higher or lower the next day, as this trade requires us to hold overnight. But we could hedge some of the potential moves with options too. Yes there are transaction costs, but most brokers give their good clients free trades (i.e. I have 100 free trades a month at Merrill edge). 

Edit: question answered. This will not work as dividends would not be qualified for such short holding periods.",1
15-11-22,"At this point, the Fed is 'damned if they do, damned if they don't'","After it released the minutes of its October Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, it became ever clearer that the Federal Reserve is setting itself up for an interest-rate hike in December.

The market has already priced in a high probability for the liftoff from zero percent interest rates (68% as of Friday). Many economists are also forecasting December.

According to Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel, the Fed has without a doubt set up expectations for next month but also put itself in a terrible position.

""Some say policymakers have backed themselves into a corner and will raise rates in December in order to save face with the markets,"" Piegza wrote this week in a note to clients. ""Of course, raising rates with half of the Fed’s mandate – stable prices – not yet met, also risks the Fed’s credibility.""

Piegza said the Fed has talked up the possibility of a rate hike in 2015 so much that not doing so would make investors and markets lose all trust in its word.

The problem, according to Piegza, is that inflation has still not hit 2% growth — which is one of the Fed's two mandates along with full employment — and likely won't by next month's meeting.

At this point, Piegza seems to have lost faith in the FOMC's outlook.

""The Fed continues to anticipate conditions will warrant a rate increase by the end of the year: 1) just as they have for years and 2) meaning conditions don't currently satisfy the needed justification for liftoff,"" she wrote in a follow-up note Thursday.

Not only has Piegza begun to question the Fed, but she also expects there is a real chance that the rest of the world will do so as well. Here's Piegza (emphasis added):

At this point, the Fed's credibility is on the line. If the Fed doesn't raise rates in December, they risk the market's interpretation of an unfounded 'promise' to do so and further distrust of monetary policymakers down the line. Of course, if they do raise rates in December despite a lack of momentum in the economy, they risk having to admit an improper policy move should inflation remain stubbornly low for some time or the economy slows further, forcing the Fed to lower rates soon after a rate increase. In other words, they are damned if they do, damned if they don't.
For what it's worth, Piegza thinks the Fed will get out of the pickle by not raising rates in December and focusing on ""underlying data and not the calendar.""",42

15-11-23,DD $TANH,"I'm pretty new. Fuck you guys.

I have a background in tax and financial planning, but trading and technical analysis is new for me. The following is me thinking that I'm now an expert after a few weeks research. Cut it up for me if you see stoopid shit.

Tantech Holdings $TANH is a Chinese company that sells bamboo charcoal bricks or some shit. Who really gives a fuck what they do. I'm looking at charts.

In all seriousness, their financial statement looks solid.

- Current P/E of 12
- Revenue and GP% is up Y/Y for three years
- Net income surged up in 2014 over 2013 due to increased GP% and reduced operating expenses
- Current assets (most of which are receivables) more than cover total liabilities.

But this is all ""value investing"" bullshit. We're here to YOLO, right? 

It looks like they had an IPO in March of 2015 at which point the shares were trading around $10 and eventually reached nearly $34 before precipitously crashing to a low of $3 in late October. Question I have is ""why the crash?"" And so far, the only thing I can come up with is that the IPO fervor wore off and the market over-reacted. I could be missing a key bit of information here, though.

So now we're at a point where I believe there may be a reversal impending.

Here is my chart analysis: http://i.imgur.com/X8oz1Lg.png

Forgive the pleb, non-Bloomberg chart.

Bullish indicators:

- RSI is approaching 50, signaling possible trend reversal.
- MACD is approaching 0, again, signaling possible trend reversal.
- DownAroon fell below 50, i.e. no new lower lows in some time.
- Bullish divergence in the RSI. A couple weeks ago, the price reached lower low, but RSI held higher low.
- ADX above 20 with an impending crossover of +DI over -DI
- Price moved above 20 day MA

Bearish indicators:

- most recent 2 candles are morning stars
- general downward trend on 50 day MA
- Upward flag/pendant consolidation after downtrend

Neutral points:

- Consolidation in price and Aroon indicators (Aroon not shown on chart linked.)
- Support around 4.30, resistane around 5.60

Here would be my entry triggers:

- MACD crosses above 0
- RSI crosses above 50
- Hammer or bullish engulfing candle
- UpAroon spikes
- Price spikes above consolidating resistance line
- +DI crosses above -DI
- ADX increases, provided preceding trigger fires

The more of these that trigger, the better I would feel about the position.

Here would be my non-entry or stop-loss triggers:

- MACD crosses below signal 
- Morning star or bearish engulfing candle
- DownAroon spikes
- MACD oscillator crosses 0
- Price drops below consolidating support line
- +DI falls further below -DI

15-11-22,Does such platform exists ?,"Hi,
I have a lot of experience in programming and cloud based services.

Since I don't have a ton of money to invest myself and I would like to put in place a cloud service that will allow investors to select the right mid or long term stock to invest to.

The system will show the classic graphs but will also allow users to select their own technical and fundamental indicators.
For example, they can screen all the securities in a given market and add specific criteria. Then when conditions are meet, an alert is displayed or send by text/mail to the user who can then buy the stock.

Of course, we will have some predefined strategies and triggers but user can built his own.
The target market are people who have a good understanding of what their investing strategy is but don't have any programming skill. And customers pay a monthly fee.

What do you think ? What should be add ?",0

15-11-23,Vanguard employer 401k plan - can you contribute directly or does it have to come from your paycheck?,"I am unable to change my contribution % to max out my 401k with my current employer, and wanted to contribute directly to my 401k (50% Roth, 50% traditional) from my personal savings. My employer only allows contributions to change at the start of each quarter. Two questions:

1. Is it possible to directly contribute to your 401K outside of paycheck with Vanguard?

2. Can I contribute to my 401k past Dec 31, 2015 and count it to the max of 2015, or will any additional contributions be counted for 2016 tax year after Dec 31?

15-11-22,My house has been my best investment,"sometimes you look back and say damn that was a good move.  Well my house has been one of those.  As I sit here inside my investment where I have lived for the past 4 years.  Hands down it is one of the best investment moves I've made!

I paid cash for this house about 4 years ago and I haven't had a monthly payment since.  It's amazing how much resources this frees up.  On the 1st of each month all you hear is crickets chirping.
Property tax and insurance is a pain in the ass but that's a small once a year hit.

When people think of houses as an investment they think of the price going up but it's much more than that.  There's much value in having a place to live.
 The price of my house has gone up too but it's more valuable to me as an investment than just the price it would sell for.

The caveat is that you are tied to a location.  
But on the flipside your living expenses are so low it's unlikely you would need to move anyway.
And you are not really tied down.  I've rented out my house and traveled the world for 8 months.
I'm terrible with saving so a lot of my money tends to go into stuff like PS4 games but It's nice to be able to decide each month where your money goes!


So anyone if anyone is in a situation where they can swing getting themselves a house I say do it!

15-11-22,Excited about a cheap local stock that i truly believe in and have a lot to learn. School me,"Ok trying this post again without the company name as some moderator deleted my thread for whatever reason. Im eager to learn here. 

Before i begin i should say im not an experianced investor. I have a 20 year old 401k plan from my employer I never touch, i dont buy and sell i just stay the course. Also I should add I know NOTHING about biomed companys or technology.

My local newspaper in NE Ohio ran a story about a biotech company from my hometown. The article caught my eye and for some reason I checked out the companys website.

Being a local company that I could drive by and see the buildings and new constructions, I could read about them in my hometown papers, see they were poised to hire hundreds of people from my community to me it didnt feel like a penny stock pipe dream.

They invented some new petri dish that detects bacterias or organisms super fast compared to the standard old petri dishes. The new dishes not only detect faster than the old, they are also considerably cheaper than the old method.

This got me thinking. Thinking about every doctors office in the world, every lab, every hospital, even every government agency in the world....could be interested in this technology. How could faster better and cheaper technology be set aside. This got me excited.

Let me give one example....

Lets say it takes 4-7 days to detect a bacteria such as ecoli or strep or even anthrax or gonorrhea lol. The list is endless and growing with new testing all the time. This new testing plate will incubate the bacteria in hours instead of days. The detection time is incredible. Shelf life is also longer on the new plates.

I was excited enough to create a scottrade account and begin investing at $0.03 per share. What im learning so far is biomed involves a LOT of waiting. Patents, university studys, testing, publishings etc. No overnight riches here.

What i do know is several universitys tested and are impressed with the product, and the goverement has asked for and used the products and signed some sort of temp. contract with the company. Also i know several patents were filed and the product was submitted to FDA for approval. Yet I wait lol

Im wondering if someone with the know how can tell me what to expect? How long does it take a product to break out from testings, studys, fda approvals, and begin getting to the world?

What will happen to my shares if a big fat cat company comes along and scoops up the company?

Thats what will happen I presume? After product is given a thumbs up from universitys and goverement some xlarge company will buy them out? What will happen to mi or shareholders like me?

My plan is to keep investing a little every week until something happens , not enough to hurt myself if it fails but enough to make significant gains if this stock flys. Its currently up to just under 0.05 cents per share. So I already made out a little bit. And I believe it will someday fly. Just not sure how all this works and whats involved in waiting.

Not sure what the rules are on posting the companys name so im not accused of trying to influence the market. But if someone would like to see the companys website and the test results page im sure you will be impessed.

What are reddits rules on me putting the symbol here anyway?

Anyone with the know how in trading or biotech ease educate me on what to expect, good or bad would love your opinion. It feels good to be able to dabble in trading aside from the boring 30 year fidelity 401k and Im really excited about it

This has pretty much blindsided me. They certainly don't need the cash to operate, and they own hundreds of thousands of preferred shares, each with a voting power x1,000 of a common share. It's also worth noting that they have not named a unit-price yet for the registered shares, it's not even clear yet that they will go through with the sale. I don't know why they just 5X multiplied their share-printing power, maybe to prevent future hostile take-overs from folks with fuck-you money?

15-11-23,OSK DD — NYSE $43.27 — (No real play),"So this is the second place ticker in the [“Pick our next DD” contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3tc5vl/pick_our_next_dd_hypnotwist_pcx99_dd_smackdown/).   Thousands of stocks out there that can double or triple and WSB wants information on a boring large stock that will slog its way maybe 10-20% on its expected good news.   This is boring DD on a binary event.   The company either gets its contract or it doesn’t.   Oh, but there’s a little dilution risk thrown into the mix just to make sure you don’t make out as good as you think you will.

-

**THE COMPANY**

-

OSHKOSH (OSK) is,basically a military contractor that makes armored vehicles.   They recently won a nice 6b contract to supply the Army with Hum-vees.   Lockheed Martin is contesting this award and the decision is due in December (December 17th deadline).   The odds are not in Lockheed’s favor.   Only 2.4% of protests actually result in the award being overturned.   You can bet this has already been factored into the share price.  And given the recent weakness in profits it likely has.  This contract, while overall positive, will work to improve weaknesses in the company’s other product lines.

-

**The Finances**

-

OSK looks like a solid company.   $40m in the bank and a 10m share buy back program.   Has 74m shares outstanding and a market cap of 3.24B.  It has friggin options — why am I DDing this again?   It has a bazillion insider transactions (Form 4), all acquiring the stock.  But here’s what’s funny.   40m cash on hand, and there’s 40m in liabilities.   And despite that stock buy back in September, In November [they registered new stock for sale](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/775158/000110465915079345/a15-22961_1s3asr.htm).  Basically this is a blank check.   OSK says they’re going to sell some stock from time to time to raise money.

-

So the question is why?   Why sell new stock after spending a crap-ton of money to buy back their old shares.   Well it’s possible they just had a bad quarter and need money.  It’s also possible they’re looking at preventing an acquisition. This may also be a poison pill to ward off being acquired.   Interesting questions I don’t have the answers for. The prospectus looks to be a mix of preferred shares and warrants and the company is authorized to issue up to 2m preferred shares.  This is an unknown risk going into “the play”.

-

**The Play**

-

Welcome to NYSE run up games.   This is basically a big boy version of RXII and AVXL.   Here we have a play that has only a 2% chance of failing.  So we’ll have a run-up into December 17th.  A few days before the decision is due, people will sell and the stock will go down.   A few people will hold through the expected decision and if it goes in OSK’s favor they will wonder why the stock is continuing to fall.   If the decision goes against OSK the stock will crater.   Some time during all of this, that stock registration prospectus may hit and OSK which thinks its stock is going to fly sky high might be diluting and if that happens there really isn’t going to be any real good news for this stock.

-

The play here is to avoid this play and look for a low point to enter the stock on in January or February and hold through a few quarters of earnings.   A few long calls ought to be pretty nice.

-

But the reality is, this is an /r/investing stock.  This isn’t a /r/wallstreetbet stock.  It’s safe and its boring and maybe if you’re lucky you’ll see a 20% gain in the run-up before it falls back down to today’s prices — if you’re lucky.

-

**Catalysts**

-

* December 17th deadline for DoD to rule on the validity of OSK’s contract.   This is a binary play with a long ""wait for earnings"" fall-back.   Only 2% chance of failure so the outcome is all but certain which means this is a total run-up game play.   If you’re not out of the stock a few days before the deadline you will probably lose money unless you're willing to hold a few quarters.   If the announcement comes before the 17th, you should probably look to leave ASAP.   The worst possible case is an early decision against OSK because the stock WILL plummet and be over sold.  At most expect 20% upside with stock trading in the lower 40s and upper 30s after the announcement until the revenue hits their books.  I will caveat this by stating that because the revenues are guaranteed, after the decision the stock may receive additional institutional buy in and stock upgrades which would positively affect the share price.  It's impossible to predict this but it is very possible to predict ""sell the news"".

-


* Earnings on the next few quarters.  If they get the contract upheld, their earnings should improve over time and their share price should follow.   Throw some money at the stock when its low in the next few months and then forget about it for a year or two.  Avoid the risk of a negative decision by the DoD and buy in a couple of days after the approval.

* [Remote] Acquisition Target.   The unexpected registration of shares with otherwise good financials and a recent stock buy back, gives me reason to believe the company may expect to be a take over target and the registration of shares a move to ward off an unwelcome take over.   If this is the case, this will be a much stronger catalyst to drive stock price than their military contract.

-

**Risks**

-

* DoD — NO.   20-30% loss (Upper 20s, lower 30s trading range).
* [Dilution](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/775158/000110465915079345/a15-22961_1s3asr.htm).

Thanks for your e-mail, unfortunately there is an issue with prophet charts not displaying on some Macs. This seems to be a Retina Display Issue rather than an OSX issue.  See below for the workaround.

Possible workaround to view ""Prophet Charts"" is to start app in low resolution:

1. Go to TOS Client app installation folder in Finder.  (Usually TOS is installed in the Applications Folder)
2. Right click -&gt; ""Get Info"".  (Right click on the TOS icon in the TOS Folder and you will see ""Get Info"")
3. Check ""Open in Low Resolution"" option and close the dialog.
4. Start TOS Client app.

Hopefully this issue with Prophet Charts will be resolved soon and you will no longer have to use this workaround. I apologize for the inconvenience.

My question is regarding a different type of trading on scottrade. Please dont laugh

Ok lets say I own (just for example) 5 shares. I sell them at $2 per share and I have 10 dollars. 

The next day I buy 20 shares at $1 with the same money.

The 3rd day I sell again at $2 and now I have $40.

The 4th day I buy 40 shares at $1 each..... With same money again and my money remains tied up in the market.

Now comes tax time, and im asked did you sell any stocks

15-11-23,Tips on becoming financially independent?,"Hi, I'd like to start off with a short introduction so that hopefully you will be able to help me a little more. A few months ago I turned 18, have been saving ever since I can remember but never really had much due to a young age and not having a job, just studying. Recently, I started studying at Aston University and managed to get a job just before that as well. I used to work full- time during the summer holidays and now because of uni, had to cut it back to part- time. Anyway, I have managed to save a couple thousand pounds during that period and I am now starting to think more seriously about my future. In other words, you could say that I stopped being a 'wisher' and want to become a 'doer' but I'm uncertain about what to do exactly with my money in order to reach my goals.
My ultimate goal is becoming a millionaire and I know that some of you may laugh but I'm telling you this because I believe that it is possible, if I put the work in, as otherwise what would be the point of me even being here and asking for help? :&gt; However, before I (hopefully) become one, I'd like to be at least financially independent and this is why I'm asking you guys for help.
What kind of help would I like to get from you? Well, I hope that somebody will be able to tell me more about the possibilities that I have in order to take the money that I have and turn it into more money. I've been interested in investing for a while now and so far this seems to be a good option, even if we consider the risks that come with it. And yes, I'm aware of the fact that stocks are not a 'Get rich quick scheme'...

If you have any questions then please, don't hesitate to ask!

After the reverse split, today it's up over 100%, and after hour trading adds another 40%.

Mostly I picked it because it had the most replies to the ticker asking for it to be DD’d.  And the description sounded interesting.

&gt;This stock dropped steeply recently owing to accounting fraud. The CEO has now changed and there underlying business is strong. I heard the last CC and the company has made very modest claims about there guidance even though they released a hugely successful peanuts movie. I think that this stock can pop and give 30% gains within December. Your DD on this would be useful in quantifying my claims. I have no idea about the financials of this company.

**The Company**

-

Iconic Brand Group Inc ($ICON) is a brand holding company.   That is, they own certain trademarks and properties and license their use to retailers and manufacturers to make products.   Peanuts is a good example.   If you see a Charlie Brown doll in a store, the manufacture is paying $ICON a fee to make and sell that doll.   The brands in their portfolio include the following labels:  Candie’s ®, Bongo ®, Badgley Mischka ®, Joe Boxer  ® , Rampage  ® , Mudd  ® , London Fog  ® , Mossimo  ® , Ocean Pacific/OP  ® , Danskin /Danskin Now ® , Rocawear  ®  /Roc Nation  ® , Artful Dodger  ® , Cannon  ® , Royal Velvet  ® , Fieldcrest  ® , Charisma  ® , Starter  ® , Waverly  ® , Ecko Unltd  ®  /Mark Ecko Cut &amp; Sew ® , Zoo York  ® , Sharper Image  ® , Umbro  ®  , Lee Cooper  ®  and Strawberry Shortcake  ® ; and interest in Material Girl  ® , Peanuts  ® , Ed Hardy  ® , Truth or Dare  ® , Billionaire Boys Club  ® , Ice Cream  ® , Modern Amusement  ® , Buffalo  ® , Nick Graham  ® , Hydraulic ®  and Pony ®

In 2014 this was a $40 stock.   Today this stock is $6.40.  This year the company lost its CEO and CFO to an accounting scandal which purports that the company mis-stated it’s accounting and guidance in 2014.   The company is being sued for this in several class action suits.  The question is: is this stock over sold?  Did our reddit thread correctly point out that this is an overall healthy company that should rebound once its finances and management are back on the up and up?  To answer this we need to look at...

-

**The Finances**

-

ICON has a strong balance sheet with roughly 369m cash on hand.   It also thinks its trade marks are worth 2.1b, which is good because they have about 1.3b in debt.   Now the bad news is that their licensing revenues have been declining and they actually lost .13c a share in the last quarter.   And future balance sheets also won’t look as good as they’ll start booking lawyer fees and restricting cash to hedge liability in the shareholder law suits which are likely to proceed.

-

The company has 48m shares outstanding and a market cap of 309M.   This company is trading at it’s cash on hand level and until it can get its debt and legal issues under control it’s likely to remain at that level.

-

**The Play**

-

So looking at the brand list above I recognize a few — Cannon, London Fog, Peanuts to name a few.  But I haven’t really seen much in the way of marketing for these brands lately.   For a company that depends on marketing its brands that is rather worrisome.   Its latest 10q shows that their advertising (prepaid advertising) has fallen 50% this year.  That hasn’t correlated directly with their revenue losses, but it does show that they are not investing in brand awareness at the moment.

-

Ultimately I conclude there is no play here unless you play very long term on a risky play.   There are no immediate positive catalysts and a lot of negative catalysts as the trials move forward and generate negative publicity.   The company is reporting a small loss right now and probably will get those losses under control but it’s going to take a long time and a lot of work to re-instill confidence in the company, and its going to take more profits to get over the new legal expenses and reserving cash for liability.  It will take several quarters of good returns to get this stock near $10 again.

-

This stock should continue to trade in its present range until the next quarterly report at which time it will track the company’s profitability or lack thereof.

-

**Catalysts**

-

* [Remote] Class actions dismissed before trial (unlikely)

-

**Risks**

-

* Trials progress generating negative publicity.
* Future ERs show mounting legal fees.
* Trials are decided in favor of the plaintiffs.
* Licensing revenue continue to decline
* Losses mount.

-

**DISCLOSURE**

-

I do not have a stake in this company.  I am not a professional trader.  This post should be the start of your due diligence otherwise my mistakes become your own.   This stock may go down.  You may lose money.  You may lose ALL your money.   So make darn sure you know what you’re buying because you are competing with people who do.

15-11-22,$DLTR-DD-Earnings Play,"EDIT: WHY DOES EVERYTHING SAY SUBMITTED BY /U/JOHNNY_HORSECOCK. THIS WAS SUBMITTED BY /U/ANDYJUNQ

**Fundamental Analysis:**

Dollar Tree ($DLTR) is having earnings on Tuesday morning before market open. In the past, the have had very strong earnings on a consistent basis. Last quarter, they reported well below their estimated EPS due to a merger with Family Dollar that took longer and cost more than they expected. Family Dollar stores also have been under performing so that is also having a negative affect on earnings. I don’t see this changing this quarter. In [the transcript](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3482956-dollar-trees-dltr-ceo-bob-sasser-on-q2-2015-results-earnings-call-transcript) from the ER conf call last quarter, the CEO made it very clear that they would not be announcing any predictions or estimated earnings for the next few quarters. They also made it clear that they don’t expect more than an EPS in the single lower digits for the first year or so from Family Dollar. This tells me they are going to under perform compared to previous years for the next few quarters while they complete the merger and get the Family Dollar stores up to Dollar Tree standards and earnings levels. They were also forced to sell off 330 Family Dollar stores by the FTC as part of the merger. They completed this in early Nov. This brought them down to the 14,000 store level that the FTC required for the merger to be approved. This took a part of their foot print away in North America.

**Technical Analysis:**

[Link to chart](http://imgur.com/nPZVHbA)

* Bollinger Bands: The closing price for Friday was within the top bollinger band however, I think that it could either open or close above it on Monday in a lead up to the ER. This is an indicator that the SP will consolidate soon. 

* Momentum: Momentum is currently up but not strong. This could turn with any down trend day.

* TTM Squeeze: This is showing an upswing however, its looking very weak with the amount of upward movement seen in SP last week. I think this could easily turn downward after ER if its another upset.

* RSI: RSI is currently showing near the high level for this stock over the last year. I don’t show a year long chart but it you look at it, RSI only spiked above 70 twice in the last year. Any other time shows 50-60 as the high range. With that, its currently over bought and due for a down turn.

**Possible Play**

Overall my play here will be to buy Dec puts. I believe if the ER disappoints there will be a big short term drop where profit can be taken on Tuesday or Wednesday. Watch the open tomorrow. If it opens above the top bollinger band, try and get in on Dec puts towards the end of the day as the SP goes higher and the put price drops. I think the SP will continue to rise into ER tomorrow. Its going to be important to get the entry right on this one. If this goes against my predictions, it will go wrong quickly at open on Tuesday. The lower you can get in, the less potential losses (As Im sure everyone realizes). 

**Disclaimer**

These are all my opinions. I am new at this. I could be very very wrong. DO YOUR OWN DD. 

I don’t currently own any shares or options contracts of DLTR. I do plan on buying puts if I see a favorable trend created on Monday.",7

""Pfizer's Chief Executive Ian Read, 62, will be CEO of the combined company, with Allergan's Saunders, 45, serving in a very senior role focused on operations and the integration, the people added.""

Eh.... Would rather have seen the opposite and Saunders as CEO.

""""Given the price tag we're seeing them pay for Allergan, I think it's tough to justify without the tax benefits. There's a bit of strategic overlap; there would be so accretion and it adds to Pfizer's growth, **but it really is that tax benefit at the end of the day that Pfizer's been very vocally pushing for**"" Vamil Divan, an analyst at Credit Suisse, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

FYI:

Under the terms of the proposed transaction, the businesses of Pfizer and Allergan will be combined under Allergan plc, which will be renamed “Pfizer plc.” The companies expect that shares of the combined company will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trade under the “PFE” ticker. Upon the closing of the transaction, the combined company is expected to maintain Allergan’s Irish legal domicile. Pfizer plc will have its global operational headquarters in New York and its principal executive offices in Ireland.

As a result of the combination with Allergan and subsequent integration of the two companies, Pfizer now expects to make a decision about a potential separation of the combined company’s innovative and established businesses by no later than the end of 2018.

Today’s announcement doesn’t come as a major surprise, given that the company already signaled its intentions to launch this product earlier this year.
It’s worth noting that this isn’t just a public service for consumers. This is a commercial product and as Google notes, “participation in Google Compare is based on a flexible cost-per-lead (CPL) model.” The company says that payment doesn’t factor into the ranking or eligibility to participate, though.
Google is launching this product under its ‘Compare’ brand, which already includes an auto insurance comparison tool. It’s worth noting that Google already offered a similar mortgage service in the UK.
To power this tool, Google partnered with Zillow and LendingTree. The financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed, but it looks like Google will pull data from lenders on Zillow’s mortgage marketplace, for example, instead of working with lenders directly.",5

So on September 17th, 2013 I have bought 125 shares of CDE, a mining company at $13.26. I have previously bought them and sold them and made few hundred bucks. I have put all my money into the 125 shares, because I started trading as way for passive income. 

Today the stock is worth $2.47, which is pretty much next to nothing if I sell my positions. Now I am being charged admin fees of $20 every quarter. This is just a recent implementation by the site I am using, so I am only down $60. 

I am looking for input as to what should I do. Should I just sell my positions, pay off the money I owe, and withdraw rest of the cash, or should I just stay in and wait out until(if ever?) price of metals will go up.

2. If you haven't bought BlackBerry calls I suggest you do so before Priv sales are released. I have high hopes, but if you did buy last week and want to get out now, you can nab a quick profit of 10-20%.

Stock has gone down about 50% from May high and think this was a good time to buy. I mean if Elon invested 10 Million $ of his own money into it surely it must be a good time to buy the stock.

15-11-23,$SUNE Set to Skyrocket,"SUNE has gotten absolutely hammered over the past few weeks.  NO LUBE.  I mean this has been a YOLO traders dream with multi millions of trades being bought? and sold! daily.  I rode this rainbow down to the pot of gold at 2.85.  SUNE has been holding gingerly here for a couple days.  Honestly the knee jerk down reactions have been unjust.  I'm not saying the stock shouldn't have gone down on days like when hedge funds are getting out.......but........ a single day 35% decline doesn't justify the bad news.  SUNE is pretty toxic but the selling has gone rampant.  

Now look here, on barely bullish news today of management restructuring the stock is up nearly 10 plus percent.  At the time of writing this there has already been 41 million shares traded.  Excellent upside volume. Just imagine some legit good news.  Shorts will get crushed.  Stock will skyrocket.  

But be prepared for some extremely volatile trading sessions.  SUNE isn't for the faint of heart.  The Algo force is strong with this one and the little breakout above your little ascending triangle you see can easily go straight up your ass.

I'm going to do some in depth DD on the chance of some really good news but before I do I thought I should let you YOLOrs know this could be a reversal for this butterface. 

I got a couple JAN 2016 $3 Calls last week and I'm seeing a nice pop today.  ",8
15-11-23,Interesting SEC filing for SGNL,"SGNL [today amended two previous stock offerings](http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=signal+genetics&amp;owner=exclude&amp;action=getcompany), de-registering the shares underlying the warrants to be re-registered on a forth coming Form-S3.   

&gt;We are deregistering such securities because, as of the effective date hereof, the representative’s warrants and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the representative’s warrants is being registered under a subsequent registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-205618).

SGNL has 10m shares and 14m in assets (no debt).  It's cash on hand value is about $1.40 and it's trading around .90.    It faces a NASDAQ price warning and placement on the non-compliance list if it can not close above $1 in the next few days.


**EDIT** Form S-3 is a shelf offering.   SGNL looks to be putting together a new prospectus although their finances don't indicate the immediate need for that.  A small exploratory stake may be worthwhile to see if this turns into a new beneficial owner, however there is a very high risk this is just a warning sign of forthcoming dilution.   I chose to add 5k to my stake.

15-11-24,Covered Call-Guaranteed profit??,"Wondering if someone can confirm I understand covered calls correctly...

I buy 100 shares of a stock at $50, and sell a call at $60 strike price for say 3 dollars. 

1. Profit is guaranteed if the stock is between $50-60, but capped at $60(which is okay-profit is profit.)
2. If the stock falls below $50, I can still profit from the $3 option (300 dollars). However I can also sell the stock at 48, limiting my loss on the shares to 200, but still making 300 from the options expiring worthless for the buyer. 

I am still figuring out options, so it would be limited to interest in the options and prices, and of course fees, but it seems like a safe bet. What are normal timeframe dates to purchase options for the covered call? It seems like this can be repeated monthly and just profit off the options expiring without shares being called away. It seems like the market has not moved much this year, and this is a solid strategy. ",9

However, with 2 P3 drugs set for potential approval/definite results in 2016, a share price not indicative of a garbage stock, and a 90% move the day after a reverse split, there's DEFINITELY something going on here.

As a disclaimer, I'm BLEEDING red right now with this stock, have been for quite some time...this stock was my first big gamble and learning lesson.  Got in at the wrong time, held through the wrong catalyst, and didn't cut my losses when I should have.  That being said, I'm long and strong by default now.  Reasons?  Warrants are most likely completely exercised, solid fucking pipeline, corporate restructuring was obviously a success, with a share price now solidly above $5 institutional buying isn't out of the question, major short squeeze underway...

A lot of you guys blindly jumped in shit after my last catalyst post.  STEM and LLTP worked out with 50% and 30% gains, respectively.  But as another disclaimer, do your own at least half-assed quick DD before making rash decisions with real money. Catalyst gambling and chasing runups can, and will, eventually fuck you if you're not strict with stops and generally cautious.

That being said, keep an eye out on AEZS.  I'm not quite sure if now is a good entry point, but 2016 should be a solid year for the company.  The CEO has a good history of turning shit companies around into $1 billion valued commercial biopharms and has sold past companies for nice premiums.  

P.S. December catalyst list coming up within the next week.  Eighty (80) motherfucking potential gambling opportunities for you all.

The best thing is; the stock kept an average RSI (Relative Strength) of a mere 43, meaning, on a technical level, there's still plenty of upside room for more purchases and growth of the bubble. 

The momentum indicator remained strong, trading up from ~95 to a daily mean of 115. 

It's still a good buy in my opinion. I added another 10,000 shares today, letting none go. I'm not selling until we see $2.00, which, should hopefully be early next year or, if everything goes well, late this year. 

It's still waving buy signals *all* over for me. Great volume, everything's remaining pretty much level on an upwards trend for our catalysts. 

We'll have to see what tomorrow brings to really tie in all the technicals, but for now, both fundamentals and technicals are giving me, and hopefully youguys, a *huge* goahead!

This is my first post on Reddit. 

So I met the founder of Sprinklebit (https://www.sprinklebit.com/profile/stellanchristensen/activity), which is a great site to trade and for learning how to invest. I'm a 19 yr/o undergrad business student. I have become interested in investing and want to learn more before I invest real money (I will probably start with around 500-1000$). Sprinklebit lets you invest $5000 in fake money to see how the markets work, or you can invest real money. Practicing and reading the tutorials help me a lot.

So putting Sprinklebit and Business school aside, how should I start investing? Should I just continue what I'm doing? 
I don't want to put real money in unless I really know what I""m doing.

15-11-25,ESPN subscriber losses and its effect on Disney.,"Eric Jackson's[ latest newsletter](http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=886b833e7ee9981fff7354cd9&amp;id=b60494b216) has an interesting take on the ESPN situation.

He says:

&gt;ESPN topped out with 99 million US subscribers (“subs”) 2 years ago, according to their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Since then, its sub count has been shrinking. It’s currently at around 92 million. That drop in subs has meant a big drop in profitability for ESPN which has been at the heart of its parent company’s profitability.

&gt;If you look at the Disney 10-K from 2013 to 2014, you can see the drop in subs:

* ESPN dropped from 99 million to 95 million (-4%)

* ESPN2 declined from 99 million to 95 million (-4%)

ESPN gets about $6.60/month per subscriber.


&gt; That difference in 7 million subs from 2013 to 2015 means ESPN has about $650 million less in affiliate revenues.  The drop in viewers also affects their ad revenues in a negative fashion (probably a drop of $250-300 million).  Most of these revenues are sheer profits.

Although, I think he has the numbers wrong here.  ESPN raises their carriage rates every chance they get.  I found a 2011 article that puts it at $4.50/subscriber per month. It's currently at $6.60/subscriber per month.  That's a 50% increase in four years.

The decrease in subscribers from 2013 to 2015 has likely been masked by increases in carriage rates.",21

Wanna know one of the better things though? 91% of the company is help by hedge funds and institutions and that numbers only going up. That means the guy with the yacht, is betting on another yacht with Cumulus Media.

15-11-25,Pretty simple straight forward strategy - anything i missunderstood?,"Im 26, out of colleged, started working some weeks ago 48k€ pretax, 3k€ cash/emergency fund, central europe.

For what I researched I found that there is literally no correlation between cleverness, hours of research and other factors with investment success but its rather luck if anyone can beat the market short term, and long term is pretty much impossible (only market manipulation and inside trading). So far my research.

So I would like to check before making stupid decisions for the next 30yrs+ an super stubborn sticking with it no matter where things go.

Pretty much the only reason I will just stay slightly under the market average (which seems the best a human can achieve), are costs. Therefore I just stick with something cheap like Vanguard.
However, there are dozen of different settings even within Vanguard with different mixture of bonds and other financial products:

Why not just pick 100% indexfonds, low cost, and ride the best performance possible: market average.

* Any particular downsides?
* Do I have to spread the risk over more than one broker in case one goes bankrupt? In Europe the goverment insures the first 100k if an entire bank goes corrupt for a savings account - think its the same for broker agencies?
* Even the cheapest brokers have cost of about 5€/$ for each transaction - wouldn't it make sense to bundle the transaction quaterly or half year? Kind of a tradeoff between transaction costs and interest of interest. Nearly all brokers offer just the first year really cheap transaction costs which will eat into my earnings.
* Already 80% ETF mix is described as 5/5 risk class, looking for 100% should i really neglect the highest risk class existing?? Always +8% besides 2008 with -10% doesnt sound so negative.

Conclusion: To me, right now its seems that any slight variation from my plan is not at the peak performance anymore. I mean I definity am missing out something, nobody does it this way!

The up to 50% decrease will apply to patients administered Daraprim — a 62-year-old drug that's used to treat malaria and parasitic infections in patients with weakened immune systems — in the hospital. That means that instead of paying $750 per pill at wholesale cost, they could pay as little as $375 per pill.

Still, the reduction will still leave Daraprim's price higher than it was initially, when it cost just $13.50 a pill.",1

15-11-26,"Currency hedging with continuous futures, as a foreign (Canadian) investor","Hello all, I am a Canadian investor with over 65% of portfolio in USD stocks. The past couple years has been great since CAD went down compared to USD. I can't say where it will go in the future, but I would like to ""lock-in"" on the current exchange rate with regards to my investments.

I've looked into hedging strategies, and came across forex options and futures. I'm using Interactive Brokers and they do not offer forex options (only forex futures options, which is too ""derivative"" for my liking), so I'm looking to purchase a futures contract but I want to make sure I am understanding and doing this right:

1. I see that there is a continuous futures contract, which will auto reroll on expiry. Does this mean I can just go long on a CAD.USD continuous futures, and expect to settle daily on currency fluctuations indefinitely until I close the position?
2. I should be going long on this contract, which means I expect to purchase CAD with USD (convert my USD investments back to CAD) at some point in the future?

Of course being a new investor who thinks he knows what he is talking about I did my research on a few pharm companies and bought a few hundred shares in a handful of companies. 
One was KBIO - I sold at 39 and got tha ef out. Made some cash it was great. 
Another was AEZ - &gt; I lost some money, but after the KBIO excitement I thought maybe the craze would create the illusion that AEZ was the ""next"" KBIO so I took $5,000 out of my line of credit and put it in after the reverse stock split point and dipped out at 18 yesterday. 

My question is, 
How the heck can you predict this stuff? (Mostly the KBIO type situations) 
Are Pharm stocks really complete luck? I'd love to understand more about the industry and what drives the prices (besides the obvious successful drug trials etc)

for KBIO all I can see is Insider buying, and management restructuring. However when that happens you tend to see a boost for sure, but 4000% in four days? Come on !

15-11-26,"Heads up on death-spiral-financed, and Canadian venture stocks.. Again","It seems like the bag-holder from earlier this summer is back promoting/cross-selling/pumping three stocks that I recommended WSB stay away from: Great basin scientific, Æterna Zentaris, Liquid Holding. And also NET Element.

He is also promoting a few other turds using the $KBIO cashtag, including but not limited to Envoy Capital Corporation, etc..

The first 2 are biotech and healthcare with the last being a liquidity provider/hedgefund services firm gone awry. And another disaster from the Internet days

All three of these companies have had warrants/convertible debentures which have either been converted against the balance sheet or infinite issue of rights (liquid holdings). 

It seems like the delusion continues for great basin shareholders... as the company increased its Change in derivative liability from exercised and issued warrants $ 24,400,224. It also increased its cashless increase (dilution on top of balance sheet settlement) Cashless exercise of warrants $173,657. The mcap of this company is roughly 23m. The company has an uphill battle, fundamentally speaking... We will leave it there.


This individual, having been a bagholder from 63 cents, continues to encourage individuals to ""buy the ask! pay the premium! this company is great"". However, he has no ideas regarding: the company's business, FDA process, FDA approval dates, FDA NDA submission, FDA IND, or really anything. 

He also continuously asks on the ST board about the stock to create conversations. Funny that someone long a stock, knows so little about warrant liabilities, or death-spiral financing deals. His lack of accounting knowledge and non-existent competence regarding pro-forma adjustments is very cringe, as well...


This is all too common in the wild west of pre-OTC NASDAQ penny stocks. Please don't buy these piece of shit stocks or contribute to the liquidity. You are probably buying the asks of existing bagholders holding out for 1c movements and posting motivational quotes on instagram, or charging thousands in chatrooms only to short KBIO and get their faces shredded.

I think the worst part of all this, is that the individual also invites owners of these stocks into some questionably (far too speculative) marijuana plays in Canada such as golden leaf, aurora, canopy growth corp... So, those trades will likely get speculated up as well, and lose most attachment to their fundamental and efficient valuations (Medbox part 2, electric boogaloo anyone?)

I have nothing against Canadian venture corporations, I am a large shareholder of Biorem stock and Zenyatta ventures. I believe in the long-term prospects of junior companies, but I want to see them treated right.

I've been a traditional ""put it in an S&amp;P500 ETF and forget about it"" investor for a while.

Today, I was comparing an index I hold to one of a competing firm. I noticed one had quarterly dividend payouts, and the other paid yearly.

The performance is similar, the biggest difference was the dividend schedule.

Is there any reason I could not collect 3/4 (~1.5%) of the quarterly payments from one ETF, and then switch to the other in December to collect the full 2% dividend of the other, and then switch back to the quarterly payout before the next ex div date? Wouldn't I be effectively double dipping into the dividend of this index?

Costs would include any transaction fees for the swap, and that any gains/losses would be forced at the end of the year if this was not done in a retirement account.

I can't imagine I'm the first one to come up with this idea - so could anybody explain to me why this would not work out in my favor?

15-11-25,ANFI Still has upside left,"So full disclosure, I'm new and still have much to learn from you brilliant bastards but I wanted to contribute something at least. 

Essentially, Amira Nature Foods is a 100 year old rice company that came under attack by Prescience Point with allegations of fraud. If you look at their chart, that's what dropped it from the $15-20 range to the $5 range. These allegations seemed bullshit, and turns out they were. 


Recently they were cleared of these charges, which caused the spike back up to $8. It's been on a steady rise since. As of now, it's above $10, so it's too late to get some of those gains, but I do believe there is some upside left. 


They've made deals with Whole Foods, and another with Price Chopper stores so they're continuing to grow. They are releasing financials any day now (before the end of the year) which I believe will help shoot this up even further. I think conservatively $15 would be easy to hit, but wouldn't be surprised if there was a spike to $20. That would be ~50-100% increase if you got in now. 


I know this isn't the usual type of stock you see on here, but it's treated me well so far and I wanted to return the favor to you sons of bitches. I've been in since $5 with only 350 shares, and only regret not buying more when I had the chance. 


Again, I'm an idiot so do your own research and please let me know if I'm completely bat shit crazy here. Like I said, I'm new and learning, so I would appreciate any other opinions or ideas about this. Hopefully this will help fund some yacht accounts, though. 

EDIT: Spelling, formatting
  
----------

EDIT: Retailers Post-Allegations

/u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR asked a good question about retailers before and after. Here's a list of agreements with retailers AFTER the allegations. Some are limited to regions, so I included the states as necessary.

Announced agreement with KeHE distributors to distribute in the U.S.

Crossmark and United Natural Foods

Publix

Amazon.com

Costco:
Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada,  and Utah.

Jewel-Osco:
Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa

Norther and Southern California, Utah: 5 Distributers
Gelson’s Markets, G&amp;G Supermarket, Harmons Grocery, Murphy’s Market, and SPD Markets.

Whole Food’s:
Agreement with stores in Florida. This seems like the beginning of their relationship and hopefully they’ll expand to all of Whole Foods.

Shaw’s Supermarkets:
Subsidiary of Albertson’s. Stores in 5 New England states.



Essentially, they're working with some big names and forming partnerships that will likely continue to grow their reach in the U.S. They're all over the world, so there are many others internationally as well.

EDIT: Unfortunately today has become a bit hectic so I haven't been able to do as much further digging as I would like.

They pay a nice dividend, are agressively trying to go green, but also still have traditional energy sources. I'm long so this isn't money I need. However,
Is there something major I am missing with this stock? I'm tempted to double down at this price.

Edit: I ended up jumping in again at $12.20",12

15-11-25,22 years old making 150k+,"I am brand new to Reddit so bare with me here. Just signed up because it's the first financial forum I've found.
I'm 22 y.o and making well over 6 figures. Goal is 185k next year. Always hit my goals ;)


I spent all my college in medical classes (fml) so I didn't learn anything useful... 


I do have a small handful of multi millionaires as mentors but I like to get a ton of opinions. I recently just dropped college, dreams of being a doctor yada yada. Got into sales, and now I'm one of the top income earners for the company. Only problem is I really don't have too many ideas what I can do with it.


Here is what I've learned thus far about investing when you have a lot of capital and can afford to do so while living very comfortably still; 

It really seems like the wealthy are maxing out Roth IRA/401k depending on tax bracket with an index fund. Always having another either mutual fund growing aggressively outside the Ira so it can be easily liquidated if a great opportunity appears.


Accumulate as much capital as possible but never store more than 40gs in the bank. Park cash in bonds. Again only pull out if a great opportunity shows up.
Such as any real estate that is well under market value. Never ever buy close to market value for flipping purposes.


Sit and wait for the market to crash. Because it will. For sure.
Then invest as much as possible in common stocks that are now essentially on sale.


now there is slight variations between mentors such as when buying a house for rent. 1 believes it's best to never put a dime of your own money into the mortgage. Only use the rent to do so because the percentage return after appreciation is very high.


Other believes pay off mortgage as soon as possible with every dime so all the rent is in the green.


My question is; is there anything I'm missing, or do you have strongly different opinions? Because I never hear anymore from them. It didn't seem like very much information. And I'm comparing it to my bodybuilding experience where I had easily spent 4 months researching.


it just seems too simple?... 😒

Was up around the $50 mark for years....it plunged to $6

I also looked at 5 or so competitive companys and all their charts look the same. Same story..... Nose dive

My second example is 
Dryship (drys) 
They ship cargo and supply oil rigs what what I understand.
It was $110 a share at one point and its now 0.16 cents
I also checked the competition and same story , charts look the same basically.

My question is , will companys like this rebound or die out? With oil dirt cheap I see why they are not drilling. With unrest in the middle east and probable war looming im thinking oil will go back up. 

Are companys like this good prospects to buy low and hold ?

15-11-26,How to find investors for a company that is not a startup but also not very firmly established ?,"Okay, so I am currently collaborating with a few biotech companies specializing in vertical farming that are stationed in Japan and The Netherlands and trying to bring them to the GCC. The companies have put a lot of research in developing their products and building small scale models for what they can achieve. They do not have the resources to expand themselves  but would provide access to their research and expertise. 

How would I go about finding investors that would be willing to provide the capital for a large scale implementation of such a product (This is not a startup and a large amount of investment would be required so I don't know if Angel.co or such websites are the right way to go). 

I realize that many of you do not have much knowledge about the market in the GCC so what steps would you take in general to try finding investors and getting in contact with them especially for ideas that are not really start-ups but expansions of existing companies. 

Edit: Thanks for all the advice guys. Here is some of the additional information you guys asked for and a summary of your advice: 

So like I said I am simply collaborating with the companies in the Netherlands/Japan which both have offices in the US. I am not an official employee but am in constant communication with management at both companies. I care very deeply about achieving food security in the GCC and I want to bring in these companies to help achieve that goal. I am very well read on agriculture in the GCC region, the limitations/advantages of the technology as well as how to best incorporate their use (i.e. Which crops should be grown, etc.. ) to make the venture a cost effective, sustainable and eventually in the long term (5-10 years) profitable specifically for GCC countries. 

 I grew up in the GCC but I am an American, currently in NYC pursuing my MD so this stuff is pretty new to me. My goal is try to find American or GCC investors to fund a large scale production of these vertical farms. The companies already have websites, some partnerships with other companies, and substantial capital ( hence my confusion in saying they were a startups). 

Your advice: 

1. This is still considered a startup so using angel.co and other similar tools will be effective 
2. Build as much hype as I can and reach out to people on LinkedIn, trade shows and by by trying to contact VC firms directly. 
3. Get a better understanding of solicitation laws 

If the additional info changes you advice at all please let me know! Finally, I know that institutions like Qatar Investment Authority or Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are more focused on investments outside of their respective companies but if I still wanted to reach out to them what is your advice on how I can get my foot through the door ( I realize that this might be very similar to the above advice)",2

15-11-26,"Stock price and 'true value'","Suppose there's some hypothetical objective 'true value' of a stock that evaluates a companies assets and potential for growth. If company X and Y are identical except for stock price so that X has a market cap of $10B and Y has $5B, the true value is the same, so Y is the better investment, right? 

Well, not necessarily, X may be able to use equity to fund expansion needed to double its true value while Y might be stuck or out competed by X's expansion.

With the perceived value by investors and the true value being linked this way, it can cause all kinds of feedback effects. It has occurred to me that big, influential investors can use this to make relatively small risk, big gains. E.g find a company whose valuation depends on ability to raise money, short it and make bearish statements until they become self-fulfilling.

It seems to me this is to some degree what has happened to SunEdison recently (the downward spiral, not necessarily as a coordinated short attack). Does this happen often? If it was as easy money as I imagine, no company would ever rely on selling stock, which doesn't seem true. How can companies protect themselves against this? Is there legal protection?",0

Scrap metal has declined in value by approximately half in 2015, and the American Metals Market (the metals industry bible) says relief won't come for 8-10 months.  This is also the case in plastics, resins, and even pulp and paper.  It's unusual for these markets to trend together, and scrappers tend to jump on the one market that's doing well when others go south.  Right now, there's no where to go, and scrappers are going out of business with some regularity.

This is largely driven by the loss of demand in China for US scrap and virgin material.  Mills that turn scrap material into virgin material are laying off workers due to the reduced demand.  My contacts tell me that this is the canary for the larger global economy slowdown.

So, I've shared what I know.  I'm curious how this community is reacting to this news, if you believe it, and what you think are the long term effects?  I'm new to this, so I'd like to hear some opinions other than mine.

15-11-26,What to research?,"When people say you have to do your research, what do they mean? If I wanted to buy into a company what do I need to know and where does it end? Like obviously things like their product, financial statements past and present and how they are going in their sector/how they are performing relative to others in their sector are important. But you could consider so many aspects of a company that I feel the research could be endless and there's no way you could know enough about all the companies to buy the right one. 

Ex. If you were looking at a company, based off their financial statements they might be doing well. But maybe this is because one of their raw materials they buy is really cheap right now. So you would need to know all about every material sector and their prices. These materials could be made in different countries so maybe the change in price was to do with economic state of the countries. That could be due to a change in political leaders etc... It just feels like you have to have a comprehensive knowledge of just about everything going on in the world to make an informed decision.",1

 My lesson was that of:
 - Emotional discipline. Something I read about aplenty but I guess you can never read enough to truly prepare you.
 - Greed, for lack of a better word, leads one ever further from value investing.  
 - Greed can turn you from considered, risk dodging investor to a speculator. 
 - There’s no such thing as a missed opportunity just under considered research.
 I read a fascinating statistic that there are over 800,000 traders, and fewer than 50,000 make a positive return. Perhaps this says a lot about how unprepared some are when coming to the market, but also much more. Some still come prepared and make losses that wipe out last year’s gains or even the decade’s.

But given the number of times oil has bounced off $40, I think this is unlikely. If there's another 2007 or 2011, the upside can be huge.

This would be a long term hold. Eventually the world will run out of oil.",2

15-11-26,101 Dividend Investing Tips from the Experts,So recently I came across [this article](http://dividendreference.com/guides/dividend-investing-tips/) I thought that collective wisdom of financial writers and bloggers could be useful to those of us who rely on dividend income. ,3
15-11-26,Drastically changing portfolio: any suggestions?,"I decided to invest mostly in Vanguard index funds. I realized I probably can't beat the market and even if I could possibly do it it would take me much research and time (I'm not Buffett). Because the market is closed today I wanted to know if you guys had any last suggestions before I make the change this coming Monday.

My portfolio now:

* AT&amp;T: 16.39%
* Apple: 7.84%
* Bed Bath and Beyond: 18.11%
* Community Health Systems: 7.52%
* Realty Income Corp: 8.15%
* SPY: 24.57%
* Walmart: 8.95%
* Assured Guaranty LTD: 7.39%

To what I plan on changing it to:

* VOO S&amp;P 500 index: 40%
* VEA Developmed Markets index: 15%
* VWO Emerging Markets Index: 10%
* VO Mid Cap ETF: 5%
* VIOO Small Cap ETF: 5%
* VCIT Intermediate Bonds: 15%
* O which is a REIT: 10%

I will note that I will be taking a 1.5% loss on the entire portfolio when I make this change; however, I think it will be worth it. I think investors make the mistake of not knowing when to fold so I want to cut my small losses now. I can take a good breath knowing that earlier this year I got a lucky gain on one stock and will actually end the year in the green. Besides my entire portfolio is only $25k.

My plan with this new portfolio is just invest every $1000 I acquire and every end of the year or so just re-balance it to get the percentages I want. I would also welcome any tips on ""re-balancing"" as well...

Any last minute suggestions from my friends here at /r/investing?

Edit:

Did it tonight. Took my small losses AT&amp;T, AGO, and BBBY and now I have this allocation (with adjustments after reading some of the comments below). I feel this leaves me greatly diversified and I know one comment said the United States was ""overweight"" that is fine with me because like Buffett says I'd always bet on America...

* VOO s&amp;p 500 index : 40%
* VEA developed market: 10%
* VWO emerging market: 10%
* VO mid cap etf: 10%
* VIOO small cap etf: 10%
* VCIT Intermediate bonds: 10%
* O a reidt: 10%

out of $25k I still have $500 leftover but after I save up to a $1000 I will contribute accordingly (so basically if one of my ETFs went from 10% to 8% I""ll put the $1000 on the lower one. ",3

(IRL) (x-post from personal finance)","From what I understand, the smart thing is to split my investment portfolio into a high-risk, high-reward slice, and a low-risk, low-reward slice.

So, I'm thinking, for the low-risk slice: start with an index fund like the S&amp;P 500.

Here's the first thing I'm not sure about: can I put it all in the S&amp;P, or should I diversify? e.g. some bonds, some gold, Berkshire Hathaway, some S&amp;P? (PS: Though I'm in Ireland, it seems easy enough to set up an account with an American stockbroker and buy American stocks.)

When the bundle gets big enough, I would ultimately be hoping to get buy-to-lease real estate in the low-risk, low-reward slice.

I don't know enough about the stock market to try to play it for higher yields, and I don't care enough to learn, so I'm just going to buy-and-hold.

For the high-risk, high-reward slice, I can invest that in my business, PPC ads, sites on Flippa, and also cryptocurrencies like Ethercoin. (PS: I've got 4-fold or 5-fold returns on stuff like this before.)

PS: I'm thinking of putting 50% in each slice.

15-11-28,$CBLI DD - NASDAQ - $4.15 (3-6 month play),"DISCLAIMER: I am a young, inexperienced trader. This is my first formal DD and I must admit it has its flaws. Constructive criticism and feedback is encouraged. 

**INTRO**

This play capitalizes on an FDA decision pending sometime in the 1st half of 2016, most likely in Q1. The upside and probability of the FDA approval makes the risk of this position well worth it in my opinion.

**THE COMPANY**

Cleveland BioLabs ($CBLI) is a biopharmaceutical company with products that have applications in radiation mitigation, oncology immunotherapy, and vaccines. This position relies on the largest and most important treatment CBLI is producing, [Entolimod (CBLB502) Biodefense](http://www.cbiolabs.com/cblb502_biodefense). This drug combats Acute Radiation Syndrome in an individual that has been exposed to dangerous amounts of radiation. **There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for ARS**.

The practical use for the drug is to lower death rates from nuclear fallout after a nuclear bomb detonates in a highly populated area. The U.S. government is interested in Entolimod for this reason - indicated by both [$15.8 million in grants from the Department of Defense](http://www.benzinga.com/news/15/09/5851982/department-of-defense-grants-cleveland-biolabs-second-award-for-advanced-developm) and an [invitation from the FDA to get EUA approval for the drug] (http://cdn.irdirect.net/IR/675/1469/CBLI%20Rodman%20Presentation%209-10-15.pdf) in June of last year - browse pages 6 to 13. 

So here's the play. EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) is given out to drugs that can be relied on as a last resort after catastrophe strikes. If the FDA gives EUA approval for Entomolid (which should occur in the 1H of 2016 as recorded in the last 10Q), the potential market for the drug expands drastically to $X00 million. The exact amount depends on how much the U.S. government stockpiles and whether or not foreign governments are attracted to Entomolid. Regardless, the current market cap of $43.88 million for CBLI is a gross underestimate of its potential.

**[THE FINANCES](http://irdirect.net/pr/release/id/1587161)**

$CBLI burns through about $1 million a month. Right now they are sitting on about $22 million (in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments) with about $2.15 million in debt, enough to keep them going for what they project to be at least 12 more months. However, the EUA will most likely be finalized before then, so the cash burn should not be an issue. This is also assuming that there are no more federal grants or awards issued, which there very well may be if the government is truly invested in Entomolid. 

**THE PLAY &amp; RISKS**

The Play: Buy $CBLI at an entry point below $4.50. Hold through Q1-Q2 of 2016 until decision from FDA comes out.

Risk: FDA does not give EUA to Entomolid.

...and that's it. I do not currently own any of this stock as I wrote this DD all of today (Friday) but I plan on buying at opening bell on Monday. Happy Trading!

They were willing to invest large sums in companies which did not have a clear business plan. This was rationalized by a pipe dream of future profits.

15-11-28,A Value Investment Case - Whole Foods [WFM],"I’ve been browsing these subs for quite some time now. What I was hoping to find when I initially stumbled upon the investing subs was more analysis of individual securities done by home-gamers, like myself. 

The only investment philosophy that makes sense to me is value investing. My personal belief is that trading and charting is no different than gambling. Traders and chartists can point to successes they’ve had as indications that these methods work. As the old adage goes, even a broken clock is right twice a day. I believe in fundamental analysis as a basis for making investment decisions.  

I have been following Whole Foods for a few months. The stock has been on a downward spiral since its 2015 peak of $57.57 per share in February 2015. The stock is currently trading under $30 per share which translates to a market capitalization of ~$10.18 Billion. My opinion is that the stock is significantly undervalued at these levels. 

As of September 27, 2015, Whole Foods operated 431 stores. For simplicity, I’ll break down the fundamentals on a per store basis. 

Market Capitalization as of November 27, 2015: $10.18 Billion / ~$23.6 million per store

2015 Free Cash Flow*: $794 million / ~$1.8 million per store

2015 Revenue: $15.4 Billion / ~$35.7 million per store 

2015 Operating Income: $861 million / ~$2 million per store

* I am defining Free Cash Flow based on the below formula. Whole Foods defines Free Cash Flow in their 10K based on the below formula and also subtracts “Development cost of new locations”.  For the purpose of this analysis, I have excluded “development costs of new locations” from FCF as it does not represent a recurring component of the Company’s operations. I see this as the cost of growth, which as I discuss below, we are ignoring. 

Net cash provided by operating activities

Less: Other Property and equipment expenditures

= Free cash flow

From reading the conference call transcriptions and listening to interviews from management, the public opinion on the biggest factor for the decline in Whole Foods’ stock price has been the flat same store sales figures. In my opinion, same store sales should not be the primary benchmark for valuing a grocer. As with any business CASH IS KING! Healthy free cash flow allows Whole Foods to invest in new stores or return capital to shareholders (which Whole Foods is doing both through dividends and share repurchases). In the each of the past 5 years, Whole Foods has grown its gross sales per sq. ft. by 9.7%, 10.0%, 8.2%, 7.6%, and 5.3%, respectively.  

I’m highly skeptical of the assumptions that go into valuations using a DCF analysis. The valuation ranges can vary widely based on the preparer’s assumptions (i.e. crap in-crap out). However, I am curious what a DCF model looks like using extremely conservative figures. For the Whole Foods example, I used a growth rate of 0% (yep zero, not even inflation) and a discount rate of 6.5%. The result was astonishing; I got back to $23.2 million per store! What this tells me is that I can buy a share of Whole Foods at the current share price of $29.41 (as of November 28th) and get the growth for free! 

I understand this analysis isn’t perfect, but the investment case is clear: Whole Foods represents a significant investment opportunity for those willing to wait. As management discusses in the 10K, there is potential for 1,200 Whole Foods Market stores in the United States. The growth potential for Whole Foods is historically proven and isn’t priced into the stock. 

Any other thoughts on WFM are welcome. 

Disclaimer: I am not, nor am I claiming to be an investment professional. This article reflects my personal opinion on WFM stock, and I am not getting paid to give my opinion. I am long WFM.

15-11-29,"Morgans Hotel Group (MHGC): &gt;100% upside from current prices","Morgans owns two related but distinct businesses. Firstly, they own, operate and manage three hotels in Manhattan, Miami and San Francisco. Secondly they run an asset-light hotel management business, which also acts as a licensor of its Morgans, Delano, Mondrian and Hudson boutique brands.  

MHGC is currently trading at around $3.20/share. I believe MHGC will be worth $7.73 within the next year, which represents a 134% return from current prices and as such offers a very compelling risk/reward opportunity. 
 
The Morgans board has been trying to effect a transaction for nearly 3 years but has failed for 2 reasons. Firstly, the slightly awkward makeup of the company means that there are few single buyers who will be interested in both parts of the company, making a sale of the company relatively more difficult to negotiate. However, more important is the fact that the board has been divided over what the best course of action should be. There is also the overhang of the preferred shares owned by Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa, which I will elaborate on later. As a result, both management and the board have lost credibility with the market, and the stock price has plummeted by over 50% ytd.  
  
I value the Hudson in Manhattan and Delano South Beach properties at around $600m together. The Hudson is located near Columbus Circle in a very valuable location. NOI for the Hudson was around $16m for 2014 and NOI for The Delano was around $15m. I used a cap rate of ~5% and $/key of around $400,000 to value the Hudson and a cap rate of ~6.25% and $/key of 1m for the Delano. Comps I used for the Hudson include the acquisition of the Sofitel NYC by Keck Seng Investments, the acquisition of the Times Square Hotel by the Qatar Group and the acquisition of the Palce Hotel by the Lotte Group. Comps for the Delano included the sales of the SLS South Beach and the James Royal Palm hotel.
 
Currently the hotel management segment of the company is earning around $15m-16m run-rate 2015. Including fees from owned hotels, sales would come to around $23m-25m. If we assume a 37% SGA haircut on sales (consistent with comps: Marriott, Choice Hotels and Starwood), EBITDA should be around $15m. The driver of value for this business is the strength of its brands; MHGC has a great track record of managing hotels: every single hotel managed by MHGC is rated 4 stars or higher on Tripadvisor and sales at thehotel at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas increased by 30% and jumped by over 100 spots on Tripadvisor after rebranding to Delano Mandalay Bay last year. MHGC’s brand equity and character provides clear differentiation from competitors. There is also a lot of potential for growth (6 signed contracts in the pipeline and each contract is material to MHGC given that EBITDA is only currently around $15m). 

The main weakness of the business is that it lacks the scale of chain like Kimpton (which had 70 hotels in its network when it was sold to Intercontinental Hotels), and thus has a loyalty scheme that isn’t as extensive as its rivals. Asset light hotel management businesses generally trade at between 12x and 17x EV/EBITDA multiples. As such I think a 15x EBITDA multiple is conservative here, giving us a value of around $225m for the business.
 
Currently, total liabilities are comprised of $600m worth of debt, which includes a $400m non-recourse Hudson/Delano mortgage loan as well as the $94m lease for the Clift hotel in San Francisco. In addition, Ron Burkle’s Yucaipa owns $75m worth of preferred shares, and the company owes Yucaipa $50m of accrued preferred dividends. Yucaipa also owns warrants to purchase 12,500,000 shares of Morgans at $6.00, which is expiring in a year. Assuming a target price of $7.60, the warrants will be worth $19.2m.
 
Taking into account the property assets worth $600m, the hotel management company valued at $225m, and assuming a haircut of 90% on the NOLs worth $380m which is $38m (back of the envelope I admit, but I think it is conservative) and subtracting the net debt of $550m minus the lease of around $94m, preferred shares of $75m, accrued dividends of $50m and warrants worth $13m, the equity is worth $239m, which is around $7.73/share. 
 
On September of 2015, a few weeks ago, Rambleside Holdings, an investment firm specializing in real estate assets and securities and one of the largest shareholders of the company offered to buy the Hudson and Delano for $507m, which is lower than our valuation for the 2 hotels but still higher than the value implied by current market prices. I believe this puts a floor on the value of the hotel properties at $507m.
 
The dividend yield on Burkle’s preferred dividends will increase to 20% from 10%, thus there is an incentive for the company to redeem the shares before this happens. Currently the firm has around $50m in cash. To redeem the shares, the company will need to raise capital, most likely by selling its two hotel properties.
 
The key risk to the thesis is the role of Ron Burkle in this whole process. As the owner of the firm’s preferred shares, his interests may not be aligned with the common shareholders. Moreover, his ownership of the preferred shares gives him certain consent rights over asset sales as well as potential acquisition of MHGC by a third party, and so he has significant influence over the value of the company. It is possible for him acquire the firm's hotel assets at an artificially low price. Theoretically he can refuse consent to the sale of the properties to a third party, essentially becoming the only viable buyer. In this worst case scenario, the firm will be a price taker, since they will be forced to sell the assets at Burkle's price.

Catalysts:

* Announcement of new CEO
* Sale of hotel properties (1 year time frame)
* Redemption of preferred shares
* Continued growth of hotel management segment

15-11-28,"A way to publicly track live statuses of wsb's DDs","I've created a ClosingBell account for wsb DDs here: https://closingbell.co/WallStreetBets

With this we can publish basic predictions from our DDs such as long/short, timeframe, and price target, and everyone can check the current status at any time (we can post a link in the sidebar). This will also allow folks to easily track wsb's long-run performance. ClosingBell also ranks all analysts, so we can compare wsb to everyone else (both amateurs and professional analyst firms post (that or there are a lot of impersonators there)). Time limits for predictions are 1 week min and 6 month max. Once a prediction is made, it cannot be amended, but user can expire a tip after 1 week and post a new tip on that stock. Price targets are in percentages points; for longs, the options are 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 200%, and 300%; for short the options are 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%. 

This is going to be only for real DD's, not just random tickers ya kunts throw out. I don't know what the specific threshold will be, but I'm sure the people in charge of the account will form some basic rules and otherwise use their discretion (yes, people, I'm hoping for help in running this thing, applications are very welcome.) 

If any one has posted past DDs that they feel are still active, and that the current SP still offers an attractive entrance (entry price cannot be manipulated, its set to the current SP within 15 min), please post a link to your DD below along with a time frame, short/long position, and price target (in percentage points please, increments of 5). I will post your tip along with a link to your DD.

Cheers ya kunts. 

Edit: details

Edit 2: I was wrong about the price target system, on the site you can set the percentage price points at 5% intervals (on the app, you can only use the intervals shown above).

Edit 3: We now have 1 successful applicant for moderating wsb's profile on ClosingBell: /u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR.
His credentials were impeccable--plenty of free time. 
A few positions are still available so don't wait apply now!

Edit 4: We have now accepted our second applicant: /u/hypnotwist.
His application was very unorthodox, the bitch-status of yours truly was called into question, but ultimately we could not pass up on such a highly qualified candidate (a survivor of the NBG pogrom, valiant proponent of other successful picks).

15-11-29,DD: A second shot at Amyris $AMRS. Target of $3 by Q2-Q3 2016.,"I talked about Amyris a long time ago in here and I said they would perform well in their Q3 report. Sadly they fell flat and dropped to pre-hype levels of around $1.60 per share.

I still have high hopes for Amyris, but their decision (released around Q3 report) to dilute even further for funding made me sad. It also made lots of investors sad. Quite understandable considering their new makeup line comes with lots of marketing costs, which has always been an issue for companies to shift towards after successful R&amp;D, but it still made me sad. 

-

As is, Amyris has a **very** developed product line. Their recent makeup line is top-class and marketing efforts are in full order. They sell patent rights to hundreds of customers. Outlook is bright. Not soon coming -- but bright.

-

My prediction for Amyris has been muted significantly. I have zero hopes it will crack $2 this year. However, I'm buying shares from now until Q2 next year. I hope that Amyris uses dilution money well enough to sell Biossance in crates. If not, fuck management for being horrible at marketing. I don't know why companies don't hire me for public relations.

15-11-30,Dime Volumes 2: My moves this week. No Penny Stocks.,"Because I love you degenerate dumb-asses, I'm going to continue these threads. If you followed [Volume 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3t7xva/my_moves_tomorrow_and_this_week_no_penny_stocks/), you probably made at least 20% profit flipping DIS puts. And also everything else I posted about. 

1. DIS meets ESPN panic for the 20th time. *Possibly* later this week I'm going to see if volume and volatility both settle down, and then buy Jan 115 calls *or* Feb 120 calls. Rate of volume change is already going down as I write. This will be a small position. 

2. I sold my OMER May 14.00-20.00 calls last week because it spiked up on low volume. BTW, I keep OMER positions open at all times. This week also looks to be a low volume week, so I'm going to wait for a dip and buy OTM Feb calls. May calls have too low of a volume so I only buy them when I can get a good deal. I have Feb calls already, but I always keep at least 5k in OMER options. 

3. Men's Wearhouse. Been reading up on this past couple days to see if a turnaround is possible. Management seems to realize that giving out great deals regularly makes your off-discount traffic horrible. I'm buying Jan 2018 calls (20-25 strike) and holding for probably 6-7 months. This is a super long-term position and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone. There will be thetabetagamma-whatever-the-fuck-it's-called decay, but I also expect change in company sentiment to improve (much like my Macy's prediction) over the coming year. 

4. MACK June calls. The thing with fatal cancer is that patients and doctors will often search out the latest medication on their own. The demographic is small and committed enough, so MACK has potential in that their marketing endeavors will be less of a hurdle than most. The black box warning is cool and all, but overplayed in significance. Sadly, the patients are going to die in less than 6 months anyway, so side-effects are the least of their concerns.  

5. Taking a **VERY BIG RISK** and throwing down 2k GURE shares (not options). I read some of their shit regarding litigation, SEC investigation, etc. It sounds hopeful in that the SEC hasn't gotten anywhere yet -- which actually takes away **none** of the underlying risk. We all know how Chinese companies have a habit of turning out to be shams, and this could very well be the same. Their financials are just *too good.* In any case, I've come to terms that I will probably lose my entire investment on this, but that's the fun part. ",28

They sell some kind of machine that tests for infection. Essentially, the problem is that the CEO and CFO are at best, financially illiterate. In fact, I even read something about one of them boasting about being financially illiterate.

Management salaries are almost as high as revenues. Their cost of goods sold is twice as much as revenues. Finally, right after their IPO, they decide to borrow even more money, establishing a clause that will ensure a death spiral:

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512138/000091228215000084/gb_424b3-03052015.htm --
""Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.""

Essentially, there was an option that allowed warrant holders to convert their warrants to shares using the price 2 business days prior, which encourages warrant holders to race towards exercising the warrants, driving the price even lower, and increasing the share-to-warrant count every time -- in a death spiral.

The company was heavily shorted by warrant holders (or more likely, sold by people smart enough to see the coming carnage) a few days prior to the time the warrants could be exercised, approximately August 25. For a month, despite a number of folks (including me) constantly warning people to stay away and explaining why, most of the time the bullish sentiment was at ~85-90% on Stocktwits. Investors who put in money on August 20 at ~$2 had lost almost all of their principal within a month's time, being diluted approximately 96%.

The dilution then stopped because the company had reached *the maximum authorized share count*, and automatic authorization of more shares wasn't accounted for in their original warrant agreement. Bullish sentiment on Stocktwits has remained high for months, between 90-95%, and multiple single or double-day pump and dumps have already occurred.

The dilution is set to continue shortly when the company authorizes more warrants after a two month cool-down period. They do have the option to pay cash for the rest of the warrants, but with their cash reserve dwindling daily, that is not an option.

""Investors"" in GBSN will again lose their principal, despite being warned repeatedly here and elsewhere. After the likely 80% drop, GBSN will either be eventually bought out (if their technology has any value at all), or more likely the company will declare bankruptcy.

GBSN's story, in the end, will be another painful reminder that we do not have an effective SEC. Nevertheless, no business school will likely read of it (unless WSB takes action?): it will disappear into obscurity, its investors' money going with it.",8

15-11-30,Question regarding stakeholder in $PIRS,"**So this guy was sitting at 5.4 - 5.5% of the company shares. He drops to &lt;5% so he no longer needs to run a SC 13G/A form. He seemed to actually cause one of the dips of PIRS, possibly. My question, then is, what would the benefit/drawback be from being in or out of this 5-20% range for 13G forms?**

&gt;Tompkins Mark N. has filled a SC 13G/A form regarding Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc 2.53 +0.03 1.20%. Filing Link: 000161577415003452. Per Tompkins Mark N.’s filing, the filler reported decreased stake in the company by -11.13 % to 1,958,912 shares. Tompkins Mark N. now owns 4.9% of the company. This form was required due to trading activity on November13, 2015.
Form 13G is used when the filer owns between 5% and 20% of the company and plans to hold it only as a passive investor. If the filler intend to exert control and if the stake’s size exceeds 20%, then a 13D must be filed. Therefore, activist investors and practices such as: hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events, are not permitted by 13G filers.

Current prediction is that if we close at or below this blue line (2080) we are going to come down and retest/go below the 200 day SMA (2065) either tomorrow or Wednesday which we can take advantage of for some quick profit taking on the short side. I expect in the next few days [as i showed in the original prediction](http://i.imgur.com/QMMzd70.png) we take out the 200 day SMA for a short term drop of about 2%-3% to about 2040 on the S&amp;P but then bounce in this range until we complete the pattern which ends right when the Fed is supposed to raise rates.

15-11-29,$NBG: Taking Out the Trash,"Have you noticed that there haven't been too many actual trades posted around here lately?  It's mostly jokes or dick waving contests these days.  So I figured it's time to post a trade about WSB favorite $NBG.  Here it is:

~~BACK UP THE TRUCK, IT'S TIME TO GO LONG BIG TIME ON THIS GREAT COMPANY~~

Just kidding.  There is money to be made off of NBG, but you'd be crazy to buy it right now.  You want to be on the short side, and you'll need to have a) good execution and b) cheap commissions.  Portfolio margin wouldn't hurt either.

Note that this isn't quite a YOLO baller bet-the-farm trade, more like returning cans you find in the trash for the five cent deposit.  By my reckoning I think this will return around 7.5% in three weeks with very little risk of actually losing money.  

Here's the trade I've been making, and I think it'll be a good one: **BUY Dec. 18 puts, strike $0.50, anywhere $0.43 and cheaper**.

Background: NBG is a turd.  If you've had the misfortune to hold this for any length of time within the last few years, chances are you've lost money.  

But it's going to get worse.  Because of NBG's capital shortfall, they've had to raise money, and they're doing it at horrific terms.  There's going to be a gigantic equity issue hitting the market next month at prices of 0.02 EUR per share (roughly $0.023 USD).  And when I say ""gigantic,"" I mean gigantic: for every 1 share of NBG currently in existence, another 19 or so are going to be issued.

The timeline for this capital raise looks like this.  I've highlighted some important dates:

http://imgur.com/pEHy5H7

Apart from the capital raise there's also a 1:15 reverse split in here that might be confusing people.  (I'm going to keep all figures in this post pre-split for ease of reading.)  Anyway, the important thing is that there will be a flood of new shares potentially hitting the market on December 14th, and these shares were sold at $0.023 per share.

So the question becomes ""what's going to happen with these shares?""  What we should see is the trading price collapsing toward that $0.023 after December 14th.  I think most of the purchasers would be more than happy to get out at, say, $0.030 if they could, for a one week profit on their end of over 30%.  

My plan is to purchase some of these shares, hopefully at prices of $0.030 or below, and exercise the options against them come December 18th.  

At 0.43 per contract, plus commissions, my breakeven point would be buying the shares at $0.063.  If they continue to trade at $0.16--and I'd be dumbfounded if this happened--I'd lose 22%.  If they trade at the new shares offer price of $0.023 I'd gain around 9.1%.  At a more ""probable"" price of $0.030 it's a gain of 7.5%.

Which isn't bad for three weeks.

This is already a crowded trade (I don't remember ever seeing an open interest this high before):

http://imgur.com/DT0jVce

...And it might be impossible to add to it come Monday as the NYSE is apparently in the process of delisting the ADRs.  But if these December 18 $0.50 strike puts still trade, and if you can pick them up at a reasonable price, I think they'll treat you well.

Good luck shitbirds!",13

15-11-30,"Investment Portfolio, is this a good approach?","I've been doing a lot of reading on these forums and messing around with some portfolio tools, and I think I'm set on an approach that makes sense. I see this breakdown a lot in articles as a typical ""3 fund"" portfolio, but never really with numbers or where which investments go where. So I was hoping to get some feedback before I start investing large sums of money into each account since I'm still pretty new to investing, but feel I'm making the right decisions.
I currently do have some money in my 401k, but nothing in a Roth or Taxable account. So for the sake of simplicity, lets just assume we're starting at 0$ for each account.    


In my 401k I would like to max it out at 18,000$ with 82% in Vanguard 500 Index Admiral (VFIAX) and 18% in Vanguard Small Cap Index Admiral (VSMAX). This should be equivalent to investing in the Total Stock Market.    


I would then max out my Roth IRA at 5,500$ yearly, putting all of it into the Vanguard Total Bond Market Admiral (VBTLX). Note that I'd put 5,500$ into it now, and then another 5,500$ to get the admiral version. I'm putting the bonds in the Roth, so that they get the tax-free favoritism.    


Lastly, I would invest 1,000$ a month over the course of the year into the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Admiral (VGTSX), more than likely starting off with 10,000$ to gain access to the Admiral version. I'm putting all of my taxable investments into the International fund to receive the foreign tax credit.    


This breaks it down into:    


12,000$ / year into Total International Stock (33%) - Taxable    


5,500$ / year into Total Bond (15%) - Roth    


18,000$ / year into Total US Stock (approx.) (50%) - 401k    


This gives me Admiral shares in all of my investments, and seems to make sense from an asset allocation standpoint (I am 28).      

As I get older, and should invest in more bonds, I would most likely continue to max the Roth in bonds only, but reduce the amount of Stocks that my 401k invests in.

15-11-30,Canadian looking for advice getting started. Purchasing index funds + TFSA,"* Age: 30
* Country: Canada
* Currency: CAD

**Introduction:**

Hey guys I’ve been lurking here for a while and have been reading a lot of investing books/websites.  I’ve never really taken advantage of having my money work for me but would like to get started ASAP.. Here’s by current assets.. Looking for advice on what a more experienced investor would do.  I find the subject of investing TFSA very hard as well.. I know it’s something good that I need to take advantage of but I just don’t understand how to get the money invested into a TFSA to make a higher interest %.

----------

**Saving Accounts:** $26,730

**Stocks (options from companies I worked for):** $39,464.47

**RRSP (invested in medium/high risk) 11k~ + Pension 4k~:** $15,450

**Real Estate:** Own Condo, Paid off roughly 35% of it. Valued around $425-450K

**Income:** $75-80K
----------
**Job security** – Strong – Union job
----------
**Contributions**
$250 Monthly contribution to RRSP. 8% of pay goes into company stock option (15% discount) some portion of pay goes into pension.
----------
**Expenses:**
Condo/Insurance/Property Tax/Utilities:
$22k~ Yearly
Only other expenses are food/clothing/beer
----------
**Questions:**
-	I want to invest about $15K of my funds from my Savings account into “Index funds” (from all my reading this is what I’m most comfortable in investing in).  What’s a good way for a Canadian to do it? Any suggested trader websites for Canadians? Should I just be doing it through BMO/RBC?

-	How should I be utilizing the TFSA? I heard you can “point” your TFSA to your current holdings?  Could I say my TFSA investment is my current stock options I already own? I think higher risk investments should be in TFSA as they have the potential to earn the most interest? I have a TFSA account with RBC but only have $100 in it because I don’t understand how to utilize it’s potential

-	 What’s my max TFSA right now? I really want to max out its potential but have no idea how to.

-	Anything else I missed or other suggestions?

Earnings season is kind of dead until Jan/feb so I'm planning on going balls to the walls with Twitter. I bought 325 shares at 25.16 and today it closed at 25.4. I'm using 100% margin too lol. My plan is sell it if it hits 25 since thats a major support level and I don't want to hold onto it if it gets there but if it breaks 26+ set a stop loss at 26.

Idk about u guys but every penny this goes up and down represents $3.25. That's actually a lot of fucking money for me lol. Hopefully it goes to 26-27 and I can make $500 on this one. 

I actually lost money on this stock before where I was 16 and my parents gave me $3k to invest with on their money and I lost like $900 on this POS but I'm going to limit my losses this time. Hopefully I can come back tomm or later this week with a good gain to show. ",0

Specifically, if they execute a trade to sell 100 shares of XYZ and close the order, I believe they must remove the 100 s of XYZ from my list of account positions, even before the trade is settled two days later. 

I am asking for the legal requirement as stated by the SEC trading rules for clearing houses.

FYI, the brokerage is Fidelity, and the website lists ""Open Positions"" and ""Closed Positions""  Clearly, an executed trade is NOT an open position, but I am really asking about my ""account positions.""",2

15-11-30,How can I track cumulative gain/loss from incremental contributions to funds?,"I've seen a number of posts here on the preferred methods for tracking investments.  For the most part, I've found good results with Google, Yahoo, Personal Capital, Morningstar, and Fidelity (my main broker) for one-off trades.  

However, none of these seem capable of showing the cumulative gain/loss of the funds where I am making monthly contributions or employer shares that are vesting quarterly, e.g.

E.g., each month last year, I bought 1 share of Company XYZ.  In January, the share cost me $100, and each subsequent month the price is $5 more.  So at year's end, I've spend $1,530 to purchase $1,860 worth of stock - my gain is $330.  

Any sites that can do this sort of calculation? Bit more nuanced than the one-time trade.  I think it might have to be something like Personal Capital that can read the incremental contributions in my accounts.",2

15-11-30,"Completely clueless on how to locate (and maybe sell?) Disney stocks I've been gifted by my grandmother over the years.","Hello everybody. I'm about to turn 21 and am looking to organize/locate these stocks I've been gifted since I was born. I'm not sure of the total number of stocks in my name. I have one physical certificate for 2 shares and what seems to be a receipt from Wheat First Securities Inc (A type of security for the stocks?) stating I had at least 7 by 1998. I plan to ask my grandmother (Custodian) for help with it soon, but in the past when I've asked her she's been reluctant to help.

If anyone could help with the following that'd be greatly appreciated:

What is Wheat First Securities Inc? I can post a pic of the receipt if need be. It talks about how securities have been transferred as per instructions and has certificate numbers as well.

Is there anywhere I can search for stocks in my/my grandmothers name?

If I locate the stocks how do I go about selling them? I'm not planning to at the moment but I'd like to know for the future.

Might edit and add some more questions in a bit.

Thanks",16
