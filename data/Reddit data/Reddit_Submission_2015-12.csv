15-12-01,Question about RealD Inc. (RLD) Buy-out.,"Okay so I am still relatively new to trading and came across that RealD is being bought out at $11.00 a share by Rizvi Traverse Management, LLC. As a result of the announcements the Board of directors is being investigated whether or not they breached their fiduciary duties, having at least one analyst with a price target set at $15.00.

Now my question is about the current stock price and what will result in the scenario they are found guilty. 

Currently the stock is priced at $10.50 which is 50 cents below the buy-out price. This leads me to understand that if RLD is found not guilty the stock will be bought out and a profit of 4.67% will be made as of right now. 

Now if the company is found guilty and they determine the shares should have been sold at a higher price what would happen? Would it cancel the buy-out? Or maybe entitle shareholders to compensation to make up for the price of which the stock was sold at?

Basically what I'm getting it is it seems like a win win to me because if I were to go in at $10.50 and the stock were to get bought at $11.00 I would make a profit of 50 cents per share. If they were found guilty and it cancelled the buy out this is because they determined the value of the stock is worth more thus bringing the value of the stock up. 

Not sure if I'm way off here or not just trying to better understand what would happen.",1

15-12-01,Atlassian could turn out to be the most successful tech IPO of the year,"The IPO market may be cooling down for a lot of tech companies, but that doesn't seem to be the case with Atlassian, the business-software maker best known for its JIRA and HipChat products. It was founded in 2002, but it hasn't taken any outside investment. 

Atlassian set its IPO price range between $16.50 and $18.50, giving it a $3.8 billion valuation at the high end, according to its latest paperwork filed with the SEC. That's slightly higher than its last private-market valuation of $3.3 billion from last year.

One of the reasons for Atlassian's popularity may have to do with its strong financials. Unlike a lot of the tech startups that are losing money, Atlassian has been profitable for the last 10 years, and is still growing at a solid pace. It's also achieving its growth without spending too much on sales and marketing, which is typically the biggest expense item for most software companies. 

At $18.50 per share, Atlassian will be able to raise $370 million from its IPO. But the price range could change again before the day of listing, depending on how much interest it draws from investors.",1

15-12-01,Unexchanged Stock Shares – Can I Exchange Them On My Own And Avoid Fees?,"I have a few shares of stock I acquired about 30 years ago. The certificate has been in my file since then and I have never done anything with it. I just received a letter from a firm, LINK Shareholder Services, stating the shares are unexchanged and they offered to process the exchange for me at a cost of 15%. I originally viewed this as an unsolicited attempt by LINK SS to get me to use their services. I have since looked into LINK SS and see they are a legitimate firm and this is something I need to take care of or risk complications when I eventually sell the stock.

It seems I need to “exchange” the shares due to the company having gone through corporate changes.

Is this exchange something I can do directly and avoid a 15% fee? I haven’t had any luck researching this topic online. Maybe there are other terms used for these exchange transactions that I should be searching for?

15-12-01,New young individual interested in investing.,"Hi there. 

I'm a young person who recently stepped into a new job where I finally have at least a small amount of funds which I believe I can put towards investing in my future. I need some advice as to where to begin. 

To give you an idea I've got maybe a couple thousand dollars that I'm ready to start with now. I understand that I have to be willing to lose this. I am. I believe it's worth it if I've got some proper education and guidance to build an account to be used for a home down payment, wedding or whatever in the future. 

I know the very basics of stock trading. I've done some reading. My biggest fears come with the research of stocks and how to know when and what to buy. I understand that many brokerage accounts like td ameritrade, fidelity and others offer services built in to provide some education and research tools but I want to be sure they're accessible and easy to learn for an inexperienced investor with no financial experience. Which brokerage is more suitable to me?

I would appreciate it if I could get some input as to where to begin and if there are any great tools I should take advantage of before opening an account. What are some dos and don'ts? Should I speak to a representative in person first at a local branch? I have many questions but I trust that there may be many of you who could provide me with information valuable to a person like me even if I didn't specifically ask for it because I don't know enough to know everything to ask for.

**Edit:** Thanks everybody for the feedback. Understanding that emerging markets are a poor short term investment re: China/Russia/Brazil madness, as well as EMs commodity relationship with the US dollar, I still believe the asset class as a whole is a great long term investment, and with the price of Vanguards $VWO index currently at Jan 2006 levels, I can't help but dump a sizable portion into this.

15-12-01,$PIRS - DD,"I'm going to spend some actual time on this DD, since its my second company I'm actually interested in.

You may have read that EPICALLY LONG DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3umubc/a_way_to_publicly_track_live_statuses_of_wsbs_dds/cxgbvyl) but that is just a bunch of actual technical analysis and he actually goes into shit that makes sense.

Here's whats up with PIRS; 
They have started developing a novel (from what I understand) protein inhibitor using ""Anticalins"", a proprietary protein from lipocalins. These proteins seem to bind inflammatory-response proteins and inhibit them - producing the desired effects.

The benefit, scientifically, from using this type of technology versus drugs, is you can get higher specificity, as well as a broader range using the same technology. Where as targetting two different proteins with chemicals, requires a brand new scaffold, patents, and pre-clinical starting points.

This is just the beginning of why this science is good. It holds a lot more promise, which is why companies like Sanofi and others have invested ""milestone"" payments. Whenever PIRS makes a 'milestone' - i.e. they pass a pre-clinical or clinical stage test and perform well - they receive a large sum of money. Currently PIRS is built to be well funded by these [milestone payments!](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pieris-pharmaceuticals-achieves-payment-milestone-130000204.html) - upwards of $100 million mapped out, however the latest are undisclosed.

Since these ""drugs"" are actually proteins, and from human origin they can be administered using inhalers - a method most other drugs fail. (You can get a quick synopsis of other benefits of proteins versus chemicals here):

Here are upcoming events:
Dec 1-3 (*TODAY*): Present at LD Micro financial meeting
http://www.ldmicro.com/p/main-event.html

Dec 8rd: [Present at Oppenheimer Health Care conference](http://www.pieris.com/news-and-events/press-releases/detail/523/pieris-pharmaceuticals-to-present-at-the-oppenheimer-26th) You can catch the [live stream]( http://www.veracast.com/webcasts/opco/healthcare2015/88114460969.cfm) of this (I will be watching).

Also, presenting at [American Society of Hematology](http://ir.pieris.com/press-releases/detail/517/pieris-pharmaceuticals-announces-presentation-of-clinical) on December 7th. 

Financials (*no fucking long-term debt!*)
 &gt;The company does not possess any long term debt, no At-The-Market offering, convertible preferred stock, or any other type of potentially toxic financing. Given their projected cash of roughly $27 million at December 31, 2015 and their current $12 million annual burn rate, the company has significant cash to last through 2017. With their strong cash position and the fact that they just completed a share offering at $2.75 only four months ago, a dilution in the near future is extremely unlikely.

The caveat? They aren't in phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials yet. Investors want to see phase 2, and 3 results in order to bite down, but I think this is a golden opportunity for investing in this company *now*.

Sitting at ~2.40 now, we can expect to see 8 by this time next year, but who the fuck yolo's a 52 week gain? You want to know what I see? I see $4 by mid December.

With these *three* presentations, I expect this more or less quietly traded company to be very loud in the news very soon. I'd put your money in now, with an expectation of 80% in 2 weeks.

*EDIT - It's an important one - the December 7th presentation will be the first in human clinical study to test whether it has adverse effects.*
The human lives: We see $4. 
The human dies: Sorry bro your robinhood account is in the red.

EDIT #2: Price is consolidated. This is both a good YOLO as well as a good /r/investing spot. If you ""miss"" a hype in the next week, the stock is likely to stay above this 2.50 for a long period. I see this as next years 52 week low.

I have looked into dcttradinggroup.com and you get a 5 day free trial with signals, after the trial if you like it you can pay weekly or monthly to continue receiving signals via whatsapp. £30 a week or £107 a month. They say they average a 7/8 out of 10 success on trades. And on Elijah Oyefesos twitter pages (owner) there are whatsapp screenshots of beginners telling the guys who run the pages they have earned up to £300 profit a day, as the people who work for the company like to follow up on the results and review how their beginners are getting on etc.

They say for beginners to usually start with a minimum off about £200 to trade with and can use any platform like Opteck or Stockpair where you can work it from a laptop, tablet or smart phone. And to only use small percentages on each trade, so your not going nuts with your money and blowing it all.

The guy Elijah has also got a documentary coming out on channel 4 UK tv soon about his success.

I read that the difference between an ETF and a mutual fund is the cost of the bid-ask spread (no idea what that means) and that you have to buy whole shares in an ETF while in a mutual fund you can put in whatever dollar amount you want.

1) Can I just keep buying VOO for its low expense ratio until I reach over $10,000 in investments and transfer it all to VFIAX? (All done with vanguard)

15-12-01,Speculating and Value Investing,"In my opinion, speculating is any loose statement about a stock with limited to no evidence to support the claim. An example of someone who makes speculative claims is Jim Cramer, famous for his show Mad Money on CNBC. He makes a lot of unsubstantiated claims, and his stock recommendations tend to underperform the market over time; many analysts agree that he is not a great stock picker. Cramer’s speculative stock picks over the long term provide enough evidence on their own to show that speculating is a bad idea that will end up COSTING you money. According to The Simple Dollar if you purchased Cramer’s stock picks in February of 2000 when he proclaimed that Internet-related companies “are the only ones worth owning right now,” by the end of 2002, a $10,000 investment spread equally across Cramer’s picks would have lost 94%, leaving you with a grand total of $597.44 (if you have time, check out thesimpledollar.com, they have some fantastic articles about investing). Next time you have spare time, turn to CNBC at 6 p.m. EST and watch a few minutes of Mad Money. If you are able to identify Cramer’s claims as speculative and ridiculous then you are on the right steps towards becoming a value investor.

What is Value Investing?

Value investing was devised by Ben Graham and David Dodd in 1928. Today some of the world’s most successful investors are value investors, such as Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman. Value investing is complicated, but on a very primitive level value investing is the belief that the stock market is a giant “voting machine,” where the prices of companies in the short term are dictated by human emotion. In order to make money, value investors attempt to exploit this flaw. An example of how the stock market is driven by human emotion is Tesla Motors Inc. Tesla Motors is currently valued at 28.8 billion dollars, interesting considering that Tesla LOST 184 million dollars in the second quarter of 2015. That’s just in ONE QUARTER. How the valuation of almost 30 billion dollars makes sense when Tesla is losing an insane amount of money is simple: human emotion. Human emotion is the driving force behind wild valuations like Tesla and the other thousands of valuations out there (think Silicon Valley, etc…). When you are involved in the hype of certain stocks or sectors, (such as tech) these valuations don’t sound as crazy as they sound to someone looking “in from the outside”. That’s how Tesla is still valued at 30 billion dollars.

So How Do Value Investors Make Money?

Value investors make money by playing off the fact that certain stocks will become undervalued or overvalued due to human emotion. Therefore, if the market arbitrarily dictates that a company that looks good on paper (has a good balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, etc…) should decrease in share price, and the stock becomes undervalued, then value investors buy the stock when it is undervalued and hold on to it for a long time (years, decades and ideally forever), knowing that in the long term the stock market follows good financials but in the short term the stock market is driven by human emotion. By exploiting the fatal flaws of human emotions, value investors can make huge amounts of money. 

I have some other articles on my blog at highschoolinvestor.com. I really would like it if you guys checked my articles out so that you can tell me about my articles and can lead to further discussion. A lot of people have called this spam and I think that's ridiculous. I'm selling no products and have no advertisements on my blog. ALL I care about is having meaningful discussions and would love it if you could read some of my work so I can discuss with other investors.

**The four valuation measurements falling into the inexpensive or fairly valued category are:**

Rule of 20: Stocks are considered fairly valued when the sum of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 forward P/E ratio and the year-over-year change in the consumer price index (CPI) is equal to 20 (or inexpensive when it’s below 20).

Fed Model: This model compares the S&amp;P 500’s earnings yield (which is the inverse of the P/E—or E/P) to the yield on long-term U.S. government bonds. Negative readings suggest favoring stocks over bonds.

Equity Risk Premiums: These subtract either the forward 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield or the forward Baa corporate bond yield from the forward S&amp;P 500’s earnings yield (E/P). Positive readings suggest stocks are undervalued relative to bonds.

Dividend Yield: Compares the current dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 with both historical averages and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. At near-equivalent yields, the market is seen as fairly valued.

**The seven valuation measurements falling into the expensive category are:**

Forward P/E: Probably the most common measurement, it divides the current S&amp;P 500 price by 12-month forward expected operating earnings. It’s presently slightly above its ~20-year median of 15.9.

Trailing P/E: Also a common measurement, it divides the current S&amp;P 500 price by 12-month trailing operating earnings. It’s presently comfortably above its ~25-year median of 17.8.

Five-Year Normalized P/E: This model uses four years of historical earnings, two quarters of forward earnings, and takes the midpoint between reported and operating earnings (it’s a take on Shiller’s CAPE, but with a shorter time span, and with an adjusted earnings calculation). It’s presently comfortably above its ~70-year median of 18.1.

Shiller’s Cyclically-Adjusted P/E (CAPE): This model uses an inflation-adjusted price for the S&amp;P 500 and divides by reported earnings over the prior 10 years. It’s presently comfortably above its ~135-year median of 16.

Price/book: Divides the current S&amp;P 500 price by the book value of its components. It’s presently slightly above its ~38-year norm of 2.4.

Tobin’s Q: Developed by Nobel Laureate James Tobin, it’s a fairly simple concept, but laborious to calculate (calculations are done by the U.S. government and the ratio’s readings are provided by the Fed). It’s often called the Q Ratio and is the total price of the U.S. stock market divided by the replacement cost of all its companies. A high Q (greater than .85) implies overvaluation.

Market Cap/GNP: Considered Warren Buffett’s “favorite valuation indicator,” the model is the ratio of total U.S. market capitalization to gross national product (GNP). It’s presently well above its ~65-year mean of 69%.

Caveats
Three of the valuation metrics above—one of which falls into the inexpensive category and two of which fall into the expensive category—deserve mention for important caveats to consider: Fed Model, Shiller’s CAPE and Market Cap/GNP.

Fed Model: Cornerstone Macro highlighted the problem with the Fed Model in a recent report on valuation. “For much of history, before the early 2000s, bond yields and earnings yields were within close range; making such a comparison an important branch in the asset-allocation decision tree. Since 2002, the gap has widened to historic highs, and has exposed the shortfalls of the model.”

“In mid-2002, the yield on the 10-year government bond fell below the yield on the S&amp;P 500. It has never crossed back since then. Thus, the Fed Model has told asset allocators for 12 straight years now to prefer stocks over bonds. That’s quite a long time to buy and hold stocks … especially while bonds have rallied so much over that time. This is one where you sometimes should fight the Fed [model].”

Shiller’s CAPE: In a version of this valuation analysis I published last May, I dissected the CAPE and the caveats which are crucial to consider.

Market Cap/GNP: As for Warren Buffett’s favorite valuation indicator, some caveats are also worth mentioning. As noted by Cornerstone, “this metric has huge weaknesses, such as not recognizing structural changes in a country’s financial system, productivity, tax policy, demographics, etc. … the list is long on why this metric isn’t useful for comparison over time.”",58

15-12-02,small cap YOLO: Short GSAT,"You want some informed yolo-ing here? Well I'm about to lay it down on you.

GlobalStar, motherfuckers make satellites, shitty satellites. GSAT has been hemorrhaging money since its inception, has been in technical default but has been filling its financing needs with equity cure contribution financing from 2 capital partners. They only have 18-24 months of liquidity left and their entire enterprise value is a reflection of the potential value of their spectrum holdings. This value is potential because it is based on the result of a hearing that has been ongoing at the FCC for nearly 3 years for the company to re-purpose its spectrum to create a new WiFi channel. And GET THIS, they have covenants in their lending agreement such that they cannot raise more debt, AND their capital partners are being paid in anti-dilutive warrants. 


What does this all mean? This stock is an option on the FCC hearing, with a large upside potential if approved but an absolutely massive downside potential if disapproved. If disapproved, the company's stock will liekly go through the floor, and they will not be able to make their interest and principal payments on their debt. They then will likely raise more equity as they cannot raise more debt or they will be bought out by some other company at rock bottom prices.

 Reccomendation: Covered short on the stock. Set a price where you are willing to loose some cash if the ruling is positive, and all dem sweet gains if the ruling comes out against.




**TLDR: covered short on GSAT based on pending FCC ruling which has effectively made the stock an option.**",7

This has not happened to me, but I have been reading articles about companies going public and the reverse - companies buying back their stock and going private.  

There is one question that hasn't really been answered in the articles I've read:  What if all the shareholders don't sell.

Example:

Dell Computers went private in 2013.

Let's say I have one share of Dell in my Vanguard account.  If I don't sell my single share, what happens?  Is it taken away from me?  Do I still own it?

On December 1, 2015, the Company learned that a patient receiving beloranib as part of the OLE portion of the study was diagnosed with bilateral pulmonary emboli and has died.
“Our thoughts are with the patient and their family at this time,” said Dr. Thomas Hughes, Chief Executive Officer of Zafgen. “Patient safety remains our top priority and we are investigating the circumstances around this event. We are also engaging in discussions with the FDA while we determine the next steps with the beloranib program.”

&amp;nbsp;

Background: A lot has changed for TapImmune over the last 5 months. They've officially entered Phase II for Ovarian/Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Many, many warrants have been exercised, and the exercise date for the dreaded 10 cent warrants that Kenneth Dart (the largest shareholder, and billionaire activist investor) received has passed.

The company is on the verge of a breakout year in 2016 - where we finally see the true valuation of the company. And it all starts with the load of catalysts that will all be happening this month and January. As such, I have bought back into the company and intend to hold for the next few months.

5 months ago, the company was way over hyped. It went from a price of .22 cents to $1.81 in less than two months. So it needed to fall to more realistic levels, where it currently stands at .60. Now the company is on the verge of several milestones/catalysts. So it's time for the company to appreciate again. Given a normal biotech evaluation, the company should have a market cap of 100-200 million as Tapimmune will shortly be a complete phase 2 company targeting a multi-billion cancer indication, with a commercial product that will be 90% cheaper than their closest competitors.

The company's technology was also given a 13 million dollar grant for a phase 2 study by the U.S Department of Defense. TapImmune will be doing their own phase 2 study and comparing data with the DoD. This kind of grant from the Department of Defense is extremely rare. Usually the DoD does $500,000 - $1,000,000 grants, so it goes to show you how valued TapImmune's technology is.

&amp;nbsp;

Catalysts: 

There are four catalysts in the next 60 days that, upon successfully hitting every one of them, should mean very healthy gains for the company's investors:

1. FDA confirmation of Orphan status for ovarian and triple negative breast cancer (December-January)
 
2. HER2 negative abstract (December)

3. Announcement of Ovarian cancer phase 2 partnership with a big pharma company (December)

4. Phase 2 enrollment for Triple negative / Ovarian (Q1)

If any one of these catalysts hits, it means good money made. If two of these catalysts hit close together, it's a jackpot.

Why is it a jackpot, you ask? Why wouldn't investor confidence just drop off past $1? Here are three reasons why investor confidence should push this stock into a 200 million market cap:

1. The company's closest competitors have a much higher market cap and inferior medicine: ONTY has a market cap of 325 million, and is just as far along as TPIV, if not a little bit behind them in terms of pipeline. http://www.oncothyreon.com/product_pipeline/pipeline.html GALE has a market cap of 241 million, and is even farther in the FDA than TPIV, albeit they have an inferior product. They also have two commercial products that generate revenue. http://galenabiopharma.com/pipeline/

2. In June, the stock hit a high of $1.81 (80 million market cap) when it was still a phase 1 company with great uncertainties about its data. Now that the data has been proven solid, it should start to catch up to the companies' closest competitors' market cap.

3. There are no more negative events to speak of (poisonous dilution etc.) that will drag down the stock price.

&amp;nbsp;

Let's talk about the warrant structure for a bit before I wrap this up:

The company is currently at a market cap of 38 million, with 6.2 million in cash, another 7.4 million in warrants waiting to be exchanged for cash at much higher prices than the current share price. TapImmune has zero debt, and they are fully funded to the end of 2016.
There are currently 62,890,762 shares outstanding, plus the assumed exercise of 5,000,000 A-1 warrants from Kenneth Dart, that brings the total up to 67,890,762. It should be noted that since Kenneth Dart bought into the company, there has been a tremendous amount of speculation and worry that he might sell his shares. This is extremely unlikely. In August, Dart exercised half of his C-1 warrants which were valued at 50 cents per warrant. He didn’t invest in Tapimmune to make a 1-bagger. Any activist investor can do that. He’s in for the long term, looking to see many times his initial investment. And he’ll get it eventually.
Kenneth Dart currently owns 25,000,000 shares in the company, with 15 million warrants available for him to exercise at .50, .75, and 1.25.
It is unclear how many shares and warrants Iroquios Capital Management, Empery Asset Management, Brio Capital Master Fund, and American Capital Management still own. 
However, they could potentially still own approximately. 27,017,000 shares, and 32,672,000 warrants.
When all warrants are exercised, the total stock issued will be just under 121,000,000 shares.

Which means, even if all warrants were exercised today (the odds of which would never happen) at 121,000,000 shares, the company would have a market cap of 72.6 million – LESS THAN A THIRD of their closest competitor.

&amp;nbsp;

All-in-all, this stock is at bargain prices as a result of Kenneth Dart's A-1 warrants being exercised on November 28th. His company: There is virtually no risk of him selling the shares at this price - (You don't take control of 40% of a company unless you believe in it in the long term, which is exactly what he and Tapimmune have indicated) so there is no real risk of the open share pool being diluted - especially not going into catalyst season, and especially when his shares could be sold for 30-40x their price in a few years once Phase 2 data proves solid.

When the catalysts hit, this should be a slam-dunk. I invite you to participate with me.

A penny stock (0.58 at time of posting). This little fucker has CRAZY ADR's. Honestly the stochastics to me are sporting a half-chub, and when this thing goes full erect this is no turning back. The MACD is ready to cross you up like KOBEEEE. Yesterday was 500k volume, today I expect 200k to end it, tomorrow maybe 150k. I would *NOT* go long on this you idiot. Don't even ask. The RSI is under 40, so it has a little bit of wiggle room and buy pressure. 

Intraday today has made about 33% gains, and if it closed now it would close 7% up. I'm telling you intraday is crazier than a bitch on her period. 

Without any fundamental analysis I would say this would make an excellent 1-2 day trade. Thursday I would not play this anymore.

It looks to be undergoing mean reversion, it's sitting at the bottom of the bollinger bands, and it is set up to hit .70 ish. maybe .75. There is no guarantee as we are not in a dominantly bull market and this thing can have news I do not know about. Keep it on your watchlist ghost rider, this is Delta over and out.

There doesn't seem to be anything strikingly bad news-wise that the market hasn't already gotten over, and the sentiment seem to be on a breakout mentality.

Hello, I am a professional investor and noticed something weird lately. A little about myself, I grew up Korea and went to school in Southern California and graduated from USC with a degree in economics. There's no jobs in this field, so I dedicate all of my time to stocks. It's paid well. So I know my shit. I have been logging the comments on this subreddit and utilized my superduperlawyer analytical skills and came upon this conclusion. Brace yourselves, you heard it here first.




Yolo and yacht are the most common things said in this subreddit. Yolo has 4 letters. Out of this whole subreddit I've concluded that only 2 of you shitheads actually own a yacht. I saw this and thought, what the fuck WSB? this can't be right, what a FUCKING COINCIDENCE. If you add 4 and 2 together, you get 6. Why was six afraid of seven? Cause seven eight nine.

15-12-02,My thoughts on why the Fed will raise interest rates on Dec 16th. Correct me if I am wrong or add to the discussion!,"Inflation has been at the center of the discussion regarding whether the Fed will raise rates soon. Inflation, however, is one of many factors to consider in hiking interest rates. Personally, I think the Fed has been using it as a scapegoat to prevent a rate hike. Remember, one of the major reasons for ZIRP (and QE) was to recapitalize banks after the 08-09 crisis. This has been accomplished and banks are sitting on TONS of reserves, which the Federal Reserve is paying interest on (http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reqresbalances.htm). I think the idea is that the Fed wants to gradually raise rates to get banks to start lending out these excess reserves. However, if the Fed Funds rate is below the IOER rate, then banks have the incentive to keep excess reserves at the Fed and note to lend them out in the market (to other banks, etc). I wonder how this will pan out and if this is precisely why inflation has been so anemic: there is no incentive to lend out money in our economy with interest rates so low.  ",4

**Elm Partners Launches Robo Portfolio Solution**

*ex-LTCM co-founder Victor Haghani moves into the Robo space opening up Elm Partners to online signup, offering SMAs at Fidelity*

Elm, founded by [Victor Haghani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Haghani) in 2011, aims to change the way people think about investing and provides a long-only, globally diversified, tax and cost efficient portfolio solution. Elm offers a systematic dynamic asset allocation approach, as well as some of the lowest management fees in the industry at 0.12% per annum. Accounts are available online via elmfunds.com/invest and are held in Separately Managed Accounts at Fidelity.

""We're able to maintain such low fees due to the inherent scalability of our technology and investment strategy."" says CEO Victor Haghani, ""We use simple metrics such as value and momentum to move beyond the limitations of pure market cap weighting, adding elements of active management to our approach.""

With $400 million of firm assets under management this positions Elm as one of the largest independents in the Robo space, coming in behind Wealthfront and Betterment. However Elm seeks to address an area of the market that Robos have not particularly focused on:  High Net Worth individuals.

Portfolio Manager, Samantha McBride says, ""Many high net worth individuals feel uncomfortable with a static investment policy, and prefer their portfolios to have the ability to respond to changing market conditions, which is the foundation of our Active Index Investing® approach.""

Key Facts

* Elm Partners was founded in 2011 by Victor Haghani, previously of the Bond Arbitrage group of Salomon Brothers and a founding partner of LTCM.
* Accounts are available from a minimum investment of $300,000 with an annual management fee of 12 basis points (0.12%).
* The service launches on December 1st at elmfunds.com/invest and is available for US taxable investors.

15-12-03,Top Car Stocks To Buy 2016,"Tesla was the top car stock last year but sold off in Q4 as we headed into 2016.  Below are my thoughts on Tesla stock in 2016 and other car stocks to buy.  General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) will continues to move sideways and are rated a sell for me.
There are many different ways to buy Car Stocks in the stock market.  You can buy the pure play automobile companies or buy the stock of auto suppliers.  Both of these sectors are a pure play on the US economy in 2016.
Vehicle stocks were flat ahead of 2016 because of the volatile late year stock market.  As we head into 2016, the Chinese economy and Interest Rate decisions will be the focus this year.  Car stocks mostly traded sideways in 2015 with big drops in Ford (F) and Volkswagen (VLKAY).  The top performing car stock was Honda (HMC) followed by Tesla (TSLA), which jumped over 6%.
Tesla Motors (TSLA) - Tesla (TSLA) is my top car stock in 2016 once again.  Tesla (TSLA) stock continues to see huge volatility but has been trending up.  The fact that Elon Musk only buys TSLA and never sells, this give confidence to current shareholders.  Tesla (TSLA) is expanding into battery production and will release more details of the Model 3 car in early 2016.  The model 3 vehicle will cost around $35,000 before government incentives.
Telsa (TSLA) stock is a strong buy below $200 in 2016 and I again have a price target of $300 per share.  If the company can report strong earnings and guidance, there is a chance we see $320-$350.
Toyota Motors (TM) - Toyota Motors (TM) stock rallied into the $140's last year but then pulled back late in the year. This automotive company continues to produce great vehicles with strong and efficient engines which is great for the consumer. I think Toyota can $145 at some point in 2016.  TM is a safe car stock to buy in 2016.
Ford (F) &amp; General Motors (GM) - Both Ford and GM are car stocks to sell in 2016.  If we hit another financial crisis, short these as much as you can.  Both Ford &amp; GM continue to make low priced and cheap vehicles that do not last.  Consumers find it very hard to trust these two brands.  If we see big gains from Ford &amp; GM in 2016, sell and buy into Tesla on a big dip.  Tesla is changing the car industry as we know it.  Electric Vehicles will continue to gain momentum and Tesla is building the charging network to power these vehicles.  I also view Honda Motor (HMC) as a safe car stock pick in 2016.

He wrote in a new note that large media and telco companies like Comcast CMCSA -1.67%, AT&amp;T T DirecTV, Verizon/AOL , Disney, and CBS CBS all could be in the market.
Certainly there would be private equity buyers at the table–that has long been a rumored outcome for Yahoo. Silver Lake Partners bought Skype from eBay in 2009 for $1.9 billion, then flipped it to Microsoft for $8.5 billion 18 months later. Yahoo, with some private equity cost-cutting, could become a more attractive option down the road.
But another contender could be the always-acquisitive Softbank , says The Wall Street Journal. Or perhaps Alibaba, with the goal of buying back Yahoo’s stake, could get in the ring.

15-12-03,YouTube Red Might Become More Of a Netflix Competitor,"YouTube is seeking streaming rights to TV series and movies to bolster its new subscription service, intensifying its rivalry with Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Hulu in the competitive market for online video.

Executives of YouTube, the Alphabet Inc. unit that is the world’s largest online-video service by viewers, have met with Hollywood studios and other production companies in recent months to consider pitches and negotiate licenses for new content, according to people familiar with the situation.

Susanne Daniels, the former programming chief of MTV who joined YouTube in the summer, and Kelly Merryman, a former Netflix content executive who joined YouTube in late 2014, are involved, one of the people said. They report to Robert Kyncl, another Netflix veteran who is now YouTube’s chief business officer.

15-12-03,"{Research} U.S. Autos &amp; Auto Parts -- Three things learned from Nov sales","*Nov. U.S. light vehicle SAAR came in at 18.19mn*, the second best monthly SAAR in
the past 10 years, and amongst one of the 10 best monthly SAAR results since 1980.
The print was slightly below our estimate and sell-side consensus of 18.3mn, but still
well ahead of the in-going trailing 6-mo/12-mo averages of 17.8/17.4mn, driven by
Black Friday promotions. Nov. SAAR was up 1.05mn units y/y, but down 50k
sequentially from Oct SAAR of 18.24mn (the current 10-year high). Results from
Toyota, Nissan, and Hyundai-Kia were better than expected, offsetting lower-thanexpected
sales from Ford, GM, and the non-J3 transplants (VW -16%, Daimler -12%).
Within the print we saw three key points:



*1. An upward sloping plateau, with little concern over peak.* By nearly any measure
SAAR (trailing 3-mo, 6–mo, or 12-mo) is at a 10-yr high, with 3-mo SAAR notably at a
robust 18.2mn. Continuing the strong momentum, we expect year-end promotional
activity to keep Dec SAAR in the high-17mn/low-18mn range. And despite growing
concerns that SAAR has peaked with imminent pressures from weaker residuals and
rising interest rates, we expect a plateau over the next two years, with 2016/17 sales of
17.8mn/17.6mn. As noted post our Global Autos Conference, sales should hold due to
a healthy consumer and supportive financing, with limited risk from rising rates (OEMs
to absorb initial rate increases with subvention) and lower residuals (steady declines).



*2. Pricing still a tale of two segments.* Amid increased concerns of weaker pricing, we
don’t think incentive spend has become unwieldy yet. Rather, mid-month incentive
data indicated pricing remains a tale of two segments. ATPs (pricing) in small/mid cars
remain soft (-2%/-3% respectively), with incentives higher and ATPs lower for nearly
all OEMs in mid cars. Conversely, pricing for light trucks remains strong – ATPs for
midsize SUVs are +4%, with incentives lower and ATPs higher for nearly all OEMs. We
expect these trends to continue through 2016.



*3. Large pickup competition to remain intense despite recent lull, yet opportunity*
remains from price/volume. Large pickup competition was at a lull in November, with
mid-month segment per-unit incentives down 3% y/y and 9% sequentially (albeit with
month-end incentives likely higher given Black Friday promotions). Amidst modestly
higher total segment sales growth, Ford F-Series was up 10%, with share sequentially
increasing to 36.5%, the highest level since January (at the expense of GM and Ram);
Ford benefited from increased F-150 fleet sales. And while we expect competition to reignite
in the coming months (especially as Ford continues to push for share), we expect
pricing to remain solid – mid-month ATPs (pricing) were robust (+6% y/y, +2%
sequentially) and at an all-time high. Overall, while competition may prevent Ford and
GM from realizing the same price tailwinds they saw earlier this year, continued price
strength and increased volumes may still yield healthy tailwinds for both OEMs in 4Q.

-----

My Take: The Auto industry has been the best performing industry the past 2Qs. Most likely due to higher miles driven per person = more replacement parts &amp; servicing, more chances of buying new cars. This is all due to low oil environment. We can expect a consumer vehicle prices to DECREASE (tiny bit) first half of next year, given current pricing on Iron and Oil derived products. ",1

15-12-03,BASECAMP VALUATION TOPS $100 BILLION AFTER BOLD VC INVESTMENT,"Basecamp is now a $100 billion dollar company, according to a group of investors who have agreed to purchase 0.000000001% of the company in exchange for $1.

Founder Jason Fried informed his employees about the new deal at a recent company-wide meeting. The financing round was led by Yardstick Capital and Institutionalized Venture Partners.
In order to increase the value of the company, Basecamp has decided to stop generating revenue. “When it comes to valuation, making money is a real obstacle. Our profitability has been a real drag on our valuation,” said Mr. Fried. “Once you have profits, it’s impossible to just make stuff up. That’s why we’re switching to a ‘freeconomics’ model. We’ll give away everything for free and let the market speculate about how much money we could make if we wanted to make money. That way, the sky’s the limit!”

A $100 billion value for Basecamp is “not outlandish,” says Aanandamayee Bhatnagar, a finance professor and valuation guru at Grenada State’s Schnook School of Business. Bhatnagar points to a leaked, confidential corporate strategy plan that projects Basecamp will attract twelve billion users by the end of 2016.
How will the company overcome the fact that there are only 7.3 billion people alive today? “Why limit users to people?” said Bhatnagar.

In order to determine the valuation of companies, Bhatnagar typically applies the following formula: [(Twitter followers x Facebook fans) + (# of employees x 1000)] x (total likes + daily page views) + (monthly burn rate x Google’s stock price)-squared and then doubles if it they’re mobile first or if the CEO has run a business into the ground before. Bhatnagar admits the math is mostly a guess but points out that “the press eats it up.”
To help handle the burdens of an increased valuation, Basecamp hired former YouTube exec Craig Mirage as Chief Valuation Officer earlier this month. Mirage hopes to replicate YouTube’s valuation success at Basecamp. “Of course, the investment comes with great expectations. But you should see the spreadsheet models we’re making up. Really breakthrough stuff,” said Mirage.

“Basecamp will lead the new global movement filled with imaginary assumptions on growth and monetization potential,” he continued. “We’re excited to roll out a list of unconfirmed revenue possibilities that involve crowdsourcing, claymation emoticons, 4D touch, in-app garage sales, goofy looking goggles, social stuff, and an app store. Also, everything we make will include a compass.”",0

*2.  They're still quite profitable, sporting a dividend of $1.54.  That's 6.07%.  After the feds raise rates and gubment bonds go down you still won't be able to find 6.07%. 

*3.  They have sinking revenue, but gross profit has stayed pretty steady AND they have dropped SG&amp;A expense to compensate, so the dividend is fairly safe.

*4.  This has been bouncing around the $24 - 28 range for a while now.  I decided to pull the trigger because those calls cost almost nothing @ $0.15.

This is my medium-term yolo play.  If anything additional happens with oil I expect this to start marching back up towards fair value in the high $20s or low $30s.

15-12-03,APRI-Apricus Biosciences what am I missing?,"
I am a PharmD that works in industry (not this company) so I like to invest in the sector as I know it personally better than other sectors. 

What really got me about APRI is their product Vitaros. It is a topical ED cream that is approved in many European countries and sold via partnership. As well this product uses a proprietary inactive ingredient that increases permeability of the product to increase absorption making a topical route possible. Their direct competitors for this product are Caverject ( a injection device into the penis) or Muse (a urethral suppository you have to insert an inch or so in). Both products as a pharmacist make me cringe and I can see it being a barrier that this over comes. 

Also in their pipeline is the first product and possibly only treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon. It's basically the same thing as Vitaros where the drug permeability product allows the active ingredient to be absorbed through the skin of the hands and feet to increase blood flow. 

The problem is currently they are low on cash but have massively expanded Vitaros markets through partnership with Takeda,  Sandoz, Ferring and Amgen. The product should be launched in the US and Latin America soon and they will be getting royalties on it. 

I can see them starting to really pull in a steady stream of income by the middle of 2016 that will grow into 2017 on this product alone then add in if they get approval on their pipeline products and they look strong if they can maintain their Financials. They look well to be in a position to bring one of the first novel SERMs to market for low testosterone in males. Won't likely be the first but the first looks like it won't be novel rather an isomer of a current generic drug. 

So anyone else looking at them? Have other thoughts or concerns as they appear rather undervalued to me so I must be missing something. ",4

15-12-03,DD $MDVN - Part 1,"* Medivation


&amp;nbsp;

* “Medivation, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of medically innovative therapies to treat serious diseases for which there are limited treatment options.”

&amp;nbsp;


* FULL DISCLOSURE: I am long on MDVN


&amp;nbsp;


* Medivation is a profitable, beaten down biotech. This is not one of those shitty ass penny stocks that you guys fucking love to lose money on.


&amp;nbsp;


* Market Cap: 6.79B


&amp;nbsp;


* Pipeline assets:

&amp;nbsp;



Xtandi:
Xtandi (enzalutamide) is the only treatment currently being marketed by Medivation. This drug is partnered with Astellas. The agreement between the two sees Medivation receiving 50% of all US sales and a double digit royalty on all ex-US sales. Xtandi was approved in 2012 (2014 for the pre chemo indication) for the treatment of pre and post chemotherapy mCRPC (metastic castration-resistant prostate cancer). As of 2015, Xtandi is on a billion dollar run rate (around $2 billion), from which Medivation will get $600-$700 million -  a 76% increase from the numbers seen in 2014. 


Xtandi is also being developed for other indications, and has shown great promise.


&amp;nbsp;


In the prostate cancer spectrum, there are two ongoing phase 3 studies – EMBARK and PROSPER. Both are still enrolling patients – these are large studies with 1860 and 1560 patients respectively (enrollment takes a lot of time). EMBARK is a registration study that is enrolling patients with high-risk hormone-sensitive non-metastatic prostate that has biochemically recurred; PROSPER is enrolling patients with non-metastatic CRPC whose disease is progressing despite androgen-deprivation therapy and who are asymptomatic.
In the breast cancer spectrum Xtandi is being considered for 3 indications: AR+ TNBC, phase 2 study data was really positive – there are plans to start a registration study ASAP, according to management; ER+ or PgR + HER2 normal, ongoing phase 2 trial; AR+ and HER2 Amplified, phase 2 study ongoing.
Astellas has also started a phase 2 trial evaluating Xtandi in patients with hepatocellular carnoma. (plus, numerous investigator sponsored trials are ongoing)
Medivation’s market cap is justified by Xtandi’s potential alone – current indication still has room to grow (revenue wise) and label broadening potential (with the new indications) is high.


&amp;nbsp;


Talazoparib: 
Medivation acquired Talazoparib from BioMarin for $410 million upfront, and up to $160 million in millestone payments, plus after FDA approval, mid-single digits royalties on sales. This was an awesome deal for Medivation. Great price, great drug. Talazoparib is a PARP inhibitor, comparable to likes of Clovis’s Rucaparib, AstraZaneca’s Olaparib – expected to bring in $2 biollion in sales, and Tesaro’s Niraparib. This shit looks goddamn crowded – but here is the deal: Talazoparib might be a best-in-class PARP, as management said in their last earnings call: “(…) Talazoparib is the most potent PARP inhibitor in development. Perhaps even more importantly, in head-to-head preclinical studies, talazoparib has been shown to be superior to other PARP inhibitors in a phenomenon known as PARP trapping, (…) correlated with a superior ability to kill cancer cells (…)”. Talazoparib is currently in numerous trials (some of which investigator sponsored), including EMBRACA, a phase 3 study on patients with with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer with germline BRCA mutations, and ABRAZO, a phase 2 study on patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer with BRCA mutations. 
This is, in my opinion, a very promising compound.


&amp;nbsp;


Pidilizumab: 
Pidilizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor that came to Medivation (phrasing! ha I’m a child) through the exercising of an option – it was developed by CureTech Ltd. Medivation paid $5 million upfront, and is bound to pay regulatory milestones of up to $85 million, and sales based milestones of up to $245 million, plus, 5-11% royalties based on global sales. PD-1 inhibitor market is also quite crowded, so until we get some results from the phase 3 study that is bound to start this year in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, I wouldn’t put much value in this asset, simply due to the lack of data – although if the study is successful this could be a blockbuster. For now, let it rest, like you would do with a nice bottle of wine.


&amp;nbsp;


MDV4463:
MDV4463 is a SREBP small molecule inhibitor, introduced recently by the company. It showed promising pre-clinical activity and is currently in a phase 1 trial. I wouldn’t assign any particular value to this asset – think of it like the icing on the cake: a money cake.


&amp;nbsp;


I will leave this here for now, as it is quite big as is. I will try to get another post with the financials and catalyst plays, although I can’t give you a precise date. Think of this as a two part DD. So before I end this, I would like to mention a few things that I will cover in depth in the next chapter: Insider ownership is low ~1%; Institutions own 97% of the float; The stock appears to be in a consolidation phase.

&amp;nbsp;

Don't rip into me unless you've done DD on biotechs yourself, these shits are hard.

Here we go boys, (and probably girls, I'm lookin at you /u/kmasprs) $CERU. Why CERU?

Well I'll start with the technical side first, I'm much better and probably more well versed in technicals.

[Chart](http://i.imgur.com/kI6KD6n.png)

This puppy lookin fire. I mean the type of fire you like when you're smokin a marshmallow over a fire (your poor ass uses dumpster barrels) to make your sweet ass some smores.

The TTM_Squeeze indicates we're goin into a reversal zone (possibly) and with today's 6% gain it looks like it's ready to test (and break) resistance. The red line is the volume resistance, coupled with the fib numbers, you will see there is some room to move if this thing can break these damn resistance markers. 

MACD was up today, and this thing isn't overbought on the huge volume spike today, This candle today *did* go over BOTH fib and volume resistances, but it closed just below both, so there's some promising hope. Stochastics are a little bit higher than your average 18 year old on loud, but that's okay because it has room to get higher so chill fam. 

However, why the biotech?

Well bitches, this thing is bound to release phase 2 results on it's drug [according to this](http://www.biopharmcatalyst.com/fda-calendar/). (Apparently we can expect to see them 2Q of 2016, may want to get in now or wait, calls would not be a bad idea.)

Now I don't know much about bio drugs, but I do know this. 

- 1.) CRLX101 is their drug, and it has [real potential](http://ceruleanrx.com/platform-pipeline/crlx101.php). It was also [fast tracked](http://www.biospace.com/News/cerulean-pharma-inc-announces-fast-track/374235) around April.

- 2.) It's in phase 2, it must've done something okay in phase 1 to get here.

- 3.) It's working with another drug [Avaspin](http://ir.ceruleanrx.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=934388) in the phase 2 trials. 

- 4.) It treats cancer in a different way, one that allows other drugs to be used as well and would be a breakthrough in treatment, undoubtedly a huge step.

You should be doing your own DD and looking into this anyways, this is just the baseline.

So from here what are the risks?

Well you fucks play bios enough to know the risk of FDA non-approval (BGMD). You also know that cash burn and financials should be looked at (they have no revenue, market cap of 101M, 10k in long term liabilities, 20k operating income, something like 70k cash on hand, I don't know the cash burn exactly but I would imagine it would be fairly high for a bio company in research for two drugs. Their pipeline also has another drug currently in phase 1, but I am not looking to play this.

The other risk is that it doesn't break resistance and tomorrow is a red day for the short term swingers.

The Play:
Well there's two ways I see this going. Tomorrow it can break technical resistance and you can net some nice profits for a day and move on with your life and never look at this again. That would be perfectly fine, maybe even wise.

*OR*

You can yolo your hearts out and play the play tomorrow and hope that resistance breaks, or even wait for a suitable entry point. There is no mention of the date for phase 2 results except for the fact that it is indicated on the FDA calendar website to be before Dec 31, 2015. The website has no listed upcoming events so I don't know what to expect, but I do know this company has two major drugs in the pipeline and it looks like a decent long term hold, or short intra day play, pick your poison. 

*EDIT*: Of course, there always runs the risk this is a pump and dump, so please play accordingly, set your stops tight and your buttholes tighter.

**EDIT 2** : 135,000 Options at the strike price of 4.21 were released for expiry in 2024, shouldn't be a problem. [here](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1401914/000120919115083327/xslF345X03/doc4.xml)

What do they make? In short they are working on cancer related drugs. The first (and further along) is Custirsen which in theory is going to up the survival rate of cancer patients by blocking cancer cells ability to evade detection and destruction. Currently it's in phase 3 trials for prostate and lung cancer. After an a short interim study by an independent committee trials were allowed to continue and are expected to yield results by mid 2016. They have another drug that is in phase 2 called Apatorsen but that is to far in the future for what I want. 

Why are you posting shit that's more than 6 months away? As of right now OGXI is under a 1.50 pps. This is a company that has no debt and more than their market cap in cash on hand. Their revenue is going to steadily decrease since they have no real product but this is something I am going to watch over the coming months. I fully expect it to drop to 1.25 at some point (maybe even lower). But if their phase 3 trials go well i see no reason they couldn't hit a share price of 3.00.

The closest case I can find to this is WTW before Oprah Winfrey announced a stake in the company, driving the stock from 3.67 to highs of 28. It is a very strong brand in need of new leadership and business management. 

The firm is currently in talks to Venture capitalist Cerebrus Capital

"" in a deal that would provide a needed cash boost to the cosmetics maker, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.

Cerberus, a New York-based private equity firm, would also take an equity stake in Avon, which has a market capitalization of close to $1.6 billion and long-term debt of around $2.2 billion, the people said. Avon also had $587 million in cash as of the end of September.

Separately, activist investor Barington Capital Group has built up a 2.8 percent stake in Avon and is launching a campaign to force changes at the company, the people said. Barington would oppose a deal with Cerberus that would value Avon near its current valuation, one of the people added.""

Guy Phillips of NuOrion has declared with Benzinga a 2.8% stake in the company and is looking to cut costs and replace CEO of the company.

This is a long hold through the New Year, as these catalysts most likely won't unfold till the end of year. Any thoughts or additional DD much appreciated!

Companies that make [ballistic clip boards](http://www.impactarmortech.com/product-clipboard.shtml). These are highly charged events, and so people will react (and often overreact) to them.

Most of the more experienced guys here know how to sell strangles, but when normal investors think about ""Limited profit endless drawdown"" they always think ""hey man, that's retarded.""

*No* you fucking asspunk, that's the way for you get rich.

Why? How? Here, take this walkthrough.

Most of you know this company called SPLS, right? It's a pretty good looking company, but... it sells fucking office stuff. Who the *fuck* buys this *shit?*

Take a look at this chart: 
[Take a fucking look.](http://puu.sh/lIC7W/01647e1899.jpg)

Sounds like a bad deal from the distance, right? Nobody wants that shit. But wait a second, before you close that chart and go to sleep like the poor fucker you are, open the options tab.

It says [""Implied Volatility ATM"" is high](http://puu.sh/lIClL/fa5d728435.png). What the fuck does that mean? That means you can collect a FUCKTON of premium. And premium guys, premium is *money*.

So, you innocently ask ""How can someone make money out of it?"", short strangles. Normally, [people get shy because it sounds the dumbest idea on earth.](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/short-strangle.aspx), but on the long term, it's best yolo play you can ever make.

""How you know that, bro?"", Simple, backtesting. Backtest this strategy and see how it works. 

If your stock doesn't suck, it'll look like [this](http://puu.sh/lICuf/a6f72107e8.png). (I know it's a straddle, it's basically the same fucking concept.): 84% winrate, median win higher than median loss, the highest drawdown was $300, etc

""Wait a second, are you telling me I am able to make $203,000 dollars in 15 years with just $600 of margin without scaling it up? What the fuck.""

Yes, you can. But you should always look for M&amp;A risks and the maximum drawdown it could get, since you don't want to be left hanging with naked puts on a fucking 200% rally.

Now, you should look for liquidity. [Write it down and look for the daily average volume.](http://puu.sh/lICG5/11c982cd7f.png), you can always scale your position with time. 

[You could also use 3rd party platforms to help you set up your positions.](http://puu.sh/lICIz/4b085ed9f1.png) 

Most of this stocks have weekly expiration, so you're able to make like, 15% a month with no excuses. If you are balls deep, you could get good at it and then trade on the CME exchange with some FX contracts (it's way harder, tho).

So there you have it. Sell volatility. You can thank me later.

15-12-04,One World Dolls ($OWOO) to merge with Tonner Doll Company,"HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

One World Holdings, Inc. [OTCPink:OWOO] and Tonner Doll Company, Inc., today announced that their Boards of Directors have approved a definitive agreement for The One World Doll Project (a subsidiary of One World Holdings) to merge with Tonner Doll Company. The agreement was entered into on December 2, 2015. The agreement is a friendly, stock-for-stock transaction in which 100 percent of Tonner Doll Company’s 145,200,000 shares outstanding will be converted into an equal number of shares of One World Holdings. Each Tonner Doll Company share will be exchanged for 1 share of One World Holdings common stock, resulting in Tonner Doll Company shareholders owning approximately 15% percent of One World Holdings common stock upon closing. Also following the closing of the merger, The One World Doll Project will change its name to Tonner One World to reflect the combined business of both companies. Under the definitive agreement, all assets, licenses and contracts of both companies will become the property of Tonner – One World, which will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of One World Holdings, which will file with FINRA and the state of Nevada to change its name to Tonner One World Holdings, Inc.

As a component to the merger, a Connecticut based private equity firm that has been a primary funder of One World Holdings for the past three years has agreed to fund the company with an additional $750,000, and plans continue to fund One World Holdings until it completes a proposed $5,000,000 round of private equity financing. In connection with the definitive agreement, One World Holdings will increase its authorized shares to 1.6 billion shares, which management believes will facilitate the merger transaction and permit One World Holdings to collateralize the $750,000 funding, as well as provide shares potentially needed to facilitate the private offering.

""The combination of The One World Doll Project and Tonner Doll Company creates an exciting opportunity for our company, for our customers, and for our shareholders,"" said Corinda Joanne Melton, President and CEO, One World Holdings. ""In addition to creating a world-class toy company, this is a compelling financial and strategic transaction for our shareholders,” she added. “Robert Tonner and his team have created a multi-million dollar collector doll company that, combined with One World, has the foundation for massive future growth, new product development and maximization on current licenses to create product for some of Hollywood’s biggest television and film projects.”

""This combination creates a company that delivers maximum value for us and we are thrilled to be joining forces with the amazing team at One World,” said Robert Tonner, CEO of Tonner Doll Company.

Management of both companies believe that the new toy company, which will be led by CEO Corinda Joanne Melton, President Robert Tonner and COO, Jack Kralik, will generate multiple benefits, including an accelerated deployment of products into big box retail stores and innovative ventures into ancillary properties such as character licensing, children's television programming, apparel, accessories and publications.

Through the merger, Tonner – One World will acquire Tonner Doll Company’s approximately 15 thousand customers. The merger agreement between The One World Doll Project and Tonner Doll Company has received board and shareholder approval from both companies, and is subject to customary conditions and is expected to close during the first quarter of 2016.

15-12-04,$ENZN dividend play -- everything you need to know,"This is not going to be a formal DD.   It's going to prep you on what to expect from ENZN's dividend announcement.

-

Basically on December 2nd $ENZN announced a [$0.25 dividend](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/727510/000114420415069086/v426112_8k.htm):
&gt;On December 2, 2015, the Board of Directors of Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) declared a special cash dividend of $0.25 per share of the Company’s common stock, payable on December 29, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 14, 2015.

-

Since the stock is $1 now, if you invest $1,000 you are guaranteed to get $250.00 when the dividend is paid.

-

Now here is the deal.   This dividend was announced when the stock was .75c.   That's a 33.3% dividend, what this means is that it's a [SPECIAL RULES, SPECIAL DIVIDEND](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_dividend#Payment_date)
&gt;In the case of a special dividend of 25% or more, special rules apply. If you sell stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date, your shares will be sold with a book entry sometimes called a ""due bill,"" which denotes that though the company will pay the dividend to your account (as the shareholder of record), your account must, in turn, turn that dividend over to the buyer of your stock. Conversely, if you buy stock after the record date but before the ex-dividend date of a large special dividend, you are entitled to the dividend and will receive it via the due bill process.

-

To you that means you can throw out the whole ""record date"" part.  To get this dividend you must own the stock at the close of regular hours trading on December 28, 2015 (double check this -- you have to hold it through the regular trading day before the ex-date).   If you buy this stock now and sell before December 28, the person who buys what you sell gets the dividend.   

-

So this stock is going to rise into December 14th as people expect to get the dividend because they're on record as having it.  It will then crater the next few days because people sell thinking they got the dividend, when in fact they are selling with a ""due bill"" giving the dividend to the buyer.

-

If you got in today, congratulations!   Sell the run up!  Then buy the dip before the 30th!

-

Oh but wait!   This stock is going to plunge on the 29th because the stock is going to lose .25c immediately thanks to that dividend because that's how dividends work!   Well yes.   But thanks to the overall general stupidity of people, most people will NOT have turned off dividend re-investment (you were planning to do that weren't you?).   Now all that dividend money is going to be plowed back into the stock and in the first hour or two that stock is going to go back up.  It won't get back to what it was trading the day before but it's going to get close, close enough that even selling at a loss, with that dividend you should still make out OK.

-

""Wow!  This stock is going to PLUNGE on December 29th!  I should short it December 28th!""   Yea -- don't do that.   Short it on December 14th if you want but make darn sure you cover before the 28th.  Short it some time on the 29th (around noon might work) if you want after the divy money has been re-invested.  But if you are short at the close of the bell on the 28th you owe your brokerage .25c per share because that brokerage owes that dividend to the people they borrowed the shares from.

-

""Wow this company pays huge dividends, I should just hold!"" Well yes they do, but holding is risky.  ENZN exists to pay royalties on obsolete drugs and one of the drugs that allows them to pay these dividends has its patent expire this year.  It has, I think 3-4 other patents for less valuable drugs but it will be quite a while before ENZN will be able to make another dividend payment like it has this year (.50 and .25).  In fact, the best use of the company's future money isn't in paying dividends its simply repurchasing stock so it can wind down is business.

-

If you play this, make 100% certain you have dividend re-investment turned off.   Know there will be tax ramifications because of that dividend unless you buy it in a retirement account.  Know you probably WILL take a loss on the stock when you sell to get out (but hopefully your dividend will be higher than your loss).  And finally know that December 14th means NOTHING except an opportunity to sell at a profit and the opportunity to repurchase over the next few days on the dip.

-

G'Luck all!   This is a fun stock to play because special rules special dividends are so rare and the general ignorance of trades around them.   Beware of the pump and dumps you'll see as the stock is manipulated by people who DO know how they work.   Anything under $1.05 is probably pretty safe, expect up to $1.25-$1.35 before the 14th with dips back to $1 after.   Expect a nice rise in the first 2 hours of trading on the ex date and then a slow sell off followed by a much larger sell off until the stock eventually returns to a .50-.75 trading range over the next few (days/weeks)

Final note and caution -- DOUBLE CHECK THE EX-DATE for the dividend.   Do it.  Do not rely on this article's dates of December 28 and December 29.   The dividend applies to owning the stock at the closing bell on the day before the EX-DATE so make darn sure you know it and are prepared to get out of the stock the next morning.  Also I can not state with certainty that selling after hours after the closing bell on the day before will still guarantee you the dividend.   For that you will need to ask a real professional (and the first person who takes your call at your brokerage probably doesn't know the answer).

Finally check the charts for ENZN back in July and August to see how this stock played on its last special dividend and note especially how it played AFTER the ex date (which is why you want out ASAP).

Also the usual rules and disclaimers apply: do your own DD.  Price ranges are estimates and not guarantees.  This is a HIGHLY risky play.   You could lose money, invest only what you feel personally comfortably losing (if any).  Also an IRA play is desirable for tax purposes but really -- playing a WSB play in your IRA?  You better darn well do your own DD before you do that ;)",26

https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01940172?term=NCT01940172&amp;rank=1

Depending on tomorrows news, we should see a 5-10% gain almost immediately on Monday. This isn't so much a ""YOLO"" play as it is a good 2016 play. Lots of news will be coming out in January to follow up on the ongoing clinical trials.

15-12-04,$CEMP pseudo-DD,"Today is my first time doing this (attempting a DD) and i bring you Cempra. It is not a complete DD as i dont have time and im writing this quickly because the stock is going down and it might be a good time to enter. I promise i will write more. Disclaimer and a bit of background:  I'm quite new at this YOLOing but experienced in the biopharmaceutical industry specially in the European market access and health economics. I know about Cempra as i worked on a project with the business market research for the european market years ago. 

Anyways, Cempra. Maybe some of you have heard it. It's a pharmaceutical company developing a ketolide antibiotic for bacteria resistant strains. They are focusing on Community acquired pneumonia (they finishes a phase 3 CT with favourable primary endpoints and are finishing another) they want to target another type of infections as gonorrea and ABSSSI. As you might have heard there have been red flags by health organisations in recent years about the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. Cempra's antibiotic (Solithromycin) a higher susceptibilty meaning that it can target resistance bacteria, cure the patients and everyone happy. The FDA issued a fast track approval process for solithromycin. There is a high probability this drug will be approved because 1) community acquired pneumonia is deadly and 2)resistant strains are becoming more resistant to current antibiotics which has to do with all the fuzz around it. 

Then what are the drawbacks? There are concerns about the safety profile Results from the phase 3 trial, which are liver damage however this has been misinterpreted, i'll explain with more detail when i upload the DD. Another hurdle is that assuming they nail the the new drug approval (NDA) they have no marketing or production capabilities. They mention that they don't really need this as only 4% prescribers make 40% of national prescriptions for antibiotics in the US, so they would only need a small workforce. However for europe is still a question mark as they need a partner and naturally there are no news about this. 

The lastest news that might have a positive impact on this situation is that Roche stopped their efforts in developing a super-bug antibiotic and speculators talk about a potential BO.

There you go, those are the highlights, i'll get you back with more details and references. Do your own research in the meantime if you are interested before buying!

EDIT: forgot  to mention the most important thing. This is yoloing (yes with small caps) I suggest that if you buy  go long for this one. ",7

The take over failed and he was fired shortly after. I think his ego alone will get him to attempt to takeover Clinuvel again.

Is Clinuvel at takeover target? 
There are a few reasons why it is possible.

1. Clinuvel today released 2 PR's. One outlining their strategy for U.S. FDA approval for their flagship drug Scenesse. Which has completed P3 testing and waiting approval. Scenesse is used for prevention of phototoxicity in adults with the orphan disease. 
[PR release](http://www.clinuvel.com/en/investors/news-publications/announcements/2015-announcements/update-on-north-american-vitiligo-program-for-scenesse)

2. A second PR was announced that P2 trials for Scenesse in treatment of vitiligo for patients with naturally darker skin are consistent with results from the previous US Phase II trial.
[PR release](http://www.clinuvel.com/en/investors/news-publications/announcements/2015-announcements/positive-preliminary-results-in-singaporean-vitiligo-study)

3. The last few months Lagoda has been buying. They now own 8% of the company on behalf of ""one of their clients"".

As far as I understand, for now, KBIO will be trying to get exclusivity for Benznidazole in the US under something called a priority review. KBIO will get a voucher for the review which could be worth quite a lot by itself, and also *if* they pass the review of course, which is far from a sure thing (you'll see why later...).

Additionally, how many people puked up stocks yesterday with the market down nearly 300, only to have it now be +300?

Look longer term, buy quality companies and preferably something that pays a dividend so you get paid to wait and compound interest.

If you have a day like yesterday and you're on here freaking out, you have to make changes. You cannot be so hyper-focused on the day-to-day and you have to have the confidence in what you own (and why you bought it - you did have a strong thesis, right?) to let your investments go on autopilot.

15-12-04,dumb watches,"$fosl and $mov are trading at cheap, cheap prices. $mov in particular has a substantial amount of current assets (repatriation, sure, but still substantial). both have grown revenues consistently in the last 5 years and both annually throw off attractive amounts of free cash.

we all know the reason behind these prices - it's apple season and apple has a new toy to sell to the kids. i suspect that we haven't seen the floor on either of these companies in the short-term.

but i really wonder whether the iwatch is just a temporary bite out of revenues caused by curious, as opposed to forever lost, consumers. both $fosl and $mov derive substantial revenues from far higher price points than those of the applewatch anyway - apple is a status symbol in a sea of nokia flip phones but not so much when we're talking $5000+ unisex jewelry. i just can't get on board with the applewatch representing the doom of classical and largely ornamental watches. to me they're not the same product and they're not for the same consumer. i could be wrong. am i wrong?",1
15-12-04,DD- CDZI- Pure Gamble,"Hi, I realized I had not submitted DD in awhile.  That is because I am having some difficulty finding a good play that fits my swing trading criteria.  This brief DD is on a company that has huge downside which is much more likely to occur that the positive outcome.

Company: Cadiz, Inc

Description: We are a publicly-held renewable resources company that owns 70 square miles of property with significant water resources in Southern California.  Since the 1980s we have operated an agricultural development in the Cadiz Valley of eastern San Bernardino County, California and are presently focused on partnering with public water agencies to implement the Cadiz Water Project, which will create a new water supply for approximately 100,000 Southern California families and make available up to 1 million acre-feet of new groundwater storage capacity.  Guided by a holistic land management strategy, we are dedicated to pursuing sustainable resource development projects and practicing responsible stewardship of our unique land and water assets.

Binary Catalyst: [The Cadiz Water Project - fluffy description here](http://cadizinc.com/water-project/)

The summary is that they are trying to use old railroad land rights in order to pipe water into drought stricken California.  The decision is political and legal.  They have received a firm no.

[Seeking Alpha has also done an interesting piece on this company](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3086056-cadiz-strong-sell-on-project-failure-insider-enrichment-and-bankruptcy-price-target-0)

From my analysis, the real possibility of any upside is less than 5%.  The downside price target is $0, yep bankruptcy.  

SO WHY ARE YOU PASTING THIS AS DD?


Well, the company got a one year extension on some of their major debt.  This is going to allow them to try Pump &amp; Dumps.  I am trying to give users of this sub a heads up before stock twits or some scammy 15 year old decides this is the best stock in the world.

There may be a chance to scalp and momentum trade on this stock down the line.  I would strongly suggest getting out as soon as possible.

I guess this is warning DD.  Since this is wallstreetbets, I wanted to go ahead and give everyone a heads up - this bet is a slot machine, not blackjack or poker.  Beware.

Good Luck",1

15-12-04,$NEOT DD,"Neothetics - Now this is world class.

A clinical stage company in phase 3 with results coming out the first half of this month. Currently trading around the 8.80 range. 

This company has two drugs in the pipeline, both that do the same thing, and it's universal.

[LIPO-202](http://www.neothetics.com/what_we_do.html) is an injection-type drug that reduces the bulging in the abdomen by removing the fat cells in non-obese patients. For those of you who cannot read - it makes somewhat overweight people skinny, in a shot, in 5 minutes, with no downtime.

And it's in stage 3.

That sounds [*really* promising](http://www.neothetics.com/lipo.html). Potentially best in class non surgical procedure. Using FDA Approved drugs and such, this thing can help pot-bellys and skinny-fat people around the world. There is definitely an unsaturated market for this, I can easily see it being used. 

	Phase 3 clinical trials targeted for the first half of 2015
	Completed Phase 2 development – statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in central abdominal bulging
	LIPO-202 tested in approximately 800 patients in six clinical trials
	Consistently well tolerated with a safety profile similar to placebo

That sounds impressive. The chances of this being approved does sound good. Lets dig deeper.

Listen to literally just the [first minute](http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/ny23qiox). I promise it's nice.

Financials for the [3rd Quarter](http://services.corporate-ir.net/SEC/Document.Service?id=P3VybD1hSFIwY0RvdkwyRndhUzUwWlc1cmQybDZZWEprTG1OdmJTOWtiM2R1Ykc5aFpDNXdhSEEvWVdOMGFXOXVQVkJFUmlacGNHRm5aVDB4TURVM01UZzJNaVp6ZFdKemFXUTlOVGM9JnR5cGU9MiZmbj1OZW90aGV0aWNzSW5jXzEwUV8yMDE1MTExMi5wZGY=).

Key Notes on Financials:

- Total Assets are down 24M from last year's 76M to 52M.
- Net Debt is down 2M from 9M Last Year to 7M This Year
- Operating Expenses are up 17M from 3 months ended of 4M (Personally, a sign that they're doing things and producing and researching heavily, promising for future growth? Who knows)
- Long Term Debt is 7.9M (Although they are working *very* hard to pay this off. They're covering the interest well and setting themselves up for a nice steady revenue stream, planning on their drug getting passed and into the open market. 
- This part is important: 71,000 warants, 1.5M Stock Options, 300,000 in Employee Stock Plan, and 1.2M in future awards under compenstaion plan. With a Market Cap of 121 M and a float of 13.7 Million, with 1.21% of that float shorts, it looks pretty decent.

Institution and Insider Summary:
[Here](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/neot/institutional-holdings)

19.93% Ownership (CERU ~45% For Comparison)
PEG is -0.08 (not good for a growth company).

[Graphics for Ownership](http://i.imgur.com/V7uBUlp.png)

For some reason lots of the institutions have lost faith in this, the selloffs have proven moreso than the buyouts. To be completely honest this worries me, as from the webcast, pipeline, and the nicely set up phase 3 trials, it looks like this company knows what it's doing. So with that, lets move to the risks.

[Per here](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02397499)

RISKS:

- Institutional ownership has been dropping, I don't know why but it has, maybe the release of good phase 3 results will attract more attention. Shareholder equity went from 60M last year to 30M this year, possibly on a drop in price and a sellout of institutions is my guess. As well as accrued deficit is up a significant amount, R&amp;D and debt payements.
- The market for this drug is good, but the demand is not exceptional, a long term hold may be sketchy. 
- Cash burn is about 20M in the past year, I hope to see this down next quarter if you're going long but in the current it shouldn't be too bad.
- This company is big, and already at $8 a share. I don't think we can expect a 2000% surge, but depending on the news and how it's played some attention should come this way.

I would wait for a good entry point of the [support and resistance lines](http://www.stockta.com/cgi-bin/analysis.pl?symb=NEOT&amp;cobrand=&amp;mode=stock) which you can see is 8.21. Hold this and keep an eye on it.

Some questions here on when to sell stocks: 

I picked a couple of companies I was interested in around May this year then got busy and forgot about them. These are all in a post tax account and I believe commission to sell would be somewhere around $8.00 per transaction. Portfolio size below is ~50k including gains with ~50% in the index fund hence the lower weighted gain. Here are my holdings: 


AMZN = 57% Gain

LUV = 32% Gain

NFLX = 12% Gain

Index Fund 4 = -0.25% Loss 

Total Weighted = 17% Gain


Originally I had planned to hold for a year to avoid the short term capital gains which would put me in May 2016 to sell. I don't need this money in the short term and mentally wrote it off when I put it into individual stocks. 

Should I go ahead and sell now to take the profits off the table?

Why?
-Stronger US demand
-Slightly offset by weaker demand in China (mostly related to new construction)
-OPEC continuing to pump out supply to win back share

RISK: World War 3

15-12-04,"Today, I covered my short on TWTR which I initiated at $53 in the summer. Here is why I believe and still believe Twitter is a horrible company to invest in","TLDR; Management and leadership too incompetent to know how to drive MAUs. 

Getting people initially on Twitter has never been a problem. In fact, they have more people who go on the site without using it than actual users. Getting people to initially create user accounts has also never been a problem. The problem lies in getting those users to continuously use the platform, as well as contribute to it. 

When you initially sign up on Facebook, your user experience is instantly enhanced with each friend acceptance. This may come off as a nuanced detail, but it's very, very important. How many of you have Twitter accounts where you follow 40-50 people you somewhat care about, then have 10 people who are usually just bots follow you? Users on Twitter, for the most part, will never feel appreciated in the same capacity they are on Facebook. 

When people don't feel appreciated on a platform, and feel like its just a social outlet for news on things they might not give a shit about, they naturally won't use the product. I still think Twitter could turn around, but only with leadership change. This leadership change must also be competent enough to understand Twitter's main barriers for new users, and that's just wishing for too much.

Unfortunately, this is my main dilemma with corporate America. There are too many incompetents managing boards who don't do jack shit. This is why I have so much admiration for activist investors like Carl Icahn. They truly have interests aligned for shareholders, rather than board members who are comfortable collecting shares for their shitty inputs which do nothing for the share price. Sorry for going off on a tangent, just needed to get that out there ;).

Anyways, I covered my short with a 55% profit after fees today because I think at these levels the smallest of good news can provide a large rally. I don't usually share my advice as an investor, so let me know any criticisms you have or if this just isn't appreciated. Thanks, good luck to all!",40
15-12-04,At What Point Do You Take a Loss? Thinking of Rebalancing to Diversify.,"Hey everyone, 

Just as the title states, how do you know when enough is enough? I currently have a position in Qualcomm and it's given me nothing but grief over the past year. I'm down 24% on it. The fact that, QCOM is facing multiple lawsuits, and declining revenues over the past 4 quarters is a big red flag to me. The reason why I've kept it around is because they have great fundamentals, but I'm starting to think it's become a value trap.

Excluding an S&amp;amp;P etf, my positions in order from greatest to smallest are Google, Apple, Disney, Tesla, Kraft-Heinz, Qualcomm, Clorox, Microsoft, CVS, Target, JP Morgan, and IBB.

Since my portfolio is quite tech heavy, my plan is to switch out QCOM with an aerospace &amp;amp; defence stock like Boeing, Lockheed, or an etf like ITA to track the sector.

15-12-04,Maybe oil is all that matters,"I was in high school in the 90s, and when I started driving, gas was $0.78 per gallon where I lived.  At that time, we basically had full employment, robust economic growth, and basically the advent of the consumer electronics market as a driving economic force.  

By the time I was 20, fuel was about $2, the economy entered recession, the .com sector collapsed, and unemployment was on the rise.  

Things didn't get much better for 15 years, through two presidents, a couple of wars, trillions in stimulus spending, job programs, financial regulations, etc., etc., etc.

Even until last year, the unemployment rate largely decreased only because 40% of the population was considered to be out of the labor market, wages were stagnant, growth was very slow.

And, now, oil has crashed again.  Unemployment is down, labor participation is up, growth is stronger, interest rates are increasing, home values are gaining steam, durable goods orders are up...2016 is shaping up to be another 1997.

Occam's razor tells me that the explanation doesn't require complex analysis, but is just that fuel costs are the primary indicator of overall economic health in the U. S. (and, so, the world).  It makes a lot of sense to me, since at $4.00 per gallon of fuel, I was spending nearly $500 per month in fuel for me and my wife, and now we're spending  $200 - I'm not pocketing the $300 savings, I'm buying TVs, going out to dinner, buying appliances, and so on.

Such a massive windfall to consumers and fuel reliant business may add something like $1.5 trillion per year to the economy  (I'm just sort of averaging, here...), that is an amazing level of stimulus, annually.  Even at half that, it's a massive impact.

I guess I just thought I'd share what I was thinking, and see what the board thought.",3

15-12-04,DeltaModz is on FIRE - TA Picks for Monday. (Robinhood Friendly),"Check out my $NEOT and $CERU DD if you haven't already.

Alright so you want a fast greasy buck? Well I'm going to try to bring that for you.

Please, before reading any more keep this in mind: Mondays are awful. They can cause drops and are momentum killers. That being said;

here's a list of momentum stocks.

I'm going to start with this one, not perfect, not bad: [$CLRB](http://i.imgur.com/XTZveWa.png)

This thing has a pretty nice setup, here's why I chose it.

- Oversold - RSI Bangin around a &lt;35
- Volume is your friend, HUGE spikes.
- Stochastics are complimenting the RSI
- It's a penny stock, trading about 1.08 after a low of 0.86, that's a hell of a gain, with a high of 1.24. Jesus. 
- The high of the day indicates to me that buying pressure is high. I am personally a fan of it.

As always keep in mind momentum can die quick and play accordingly.

Next up: [$ICA](http://i.imgur.com/mgYXV5g.png):

ICA is a penny stock as well closing at around 0.9, here's why I picked:

- RSI &lt;30 - Oversold as hell
- Heavy volume past few days (Watch out, the only thing I don't like about this stock pick is that the volume on the drops is heavier than the volume on the liftoff... however that being said)
- It is on the lower end of the bollinger bands, reversing to the mean just like $SPU did, and we all know you lovd that one.
- Stochastics chillin in oversold.
- MACD on it's way to a crossover, although not quite there yet, the TTM_Squeeze is showing a reversal but it could just as easily drop again. 

This stock pick probably has the best potential in terms of % change, but it could be for the better or worse. Watch yourselves out there you hotdogs.

Two more to go: Next up is [$LRAD](http://i.imgur.com/aiCNDmI.png):

This one... holy shit this is a moody fellar. 

- MACD Crossover today, not subtle but right into it, potential for another day or two of gainz.
- RSI is heading *up*. I would be very wary of this.
- Stochastics are having a very sexy crossover, oh man.
- HUGE VOLUME TODAY MAH GAWD. No seriously a heavy volume spike on a low volume stock like this on a serious gain is great news, another sub 1.50 stock. Gainz are there, maybe just hiding.
- Last, but maybe most importantly, this thing is squeezing. Look at the last indicator, the momentum is all over the place and currently it is up. This could just as well reverse again so I would *not* get in at open and wait to see how this thing opens up. If it flies up, it's alright, just get a good entry and don't chase.

I hope you are remembering monday can kill all of these gains and make these unpredictable. 

Last but not least: [$ODP](http://i.imgur.com/uOBDsXl.png):

ODP is a quaint fellow. Remember $SPU's setup with the massive highs but low closes? Well it's back and I love that. The only thing different is this doesn't have that volume advantage. It's been relatively consistent, just more aggressive bears.

- RSI &lt; 35 - Oversold
- MACD Crossover Imminent
- Reversing to mean from Bolly Bands
- Stochastics are looking really promising

The only thing with this stock is it's trading around 6.64 so percentage wise you may not see the most of changes, although I would hold onto this and ICA for a couple days for max gains.

I hope you all enjoyed this, let me know what you think and as always post your gains!

Thanks again from yours truly. Go fuck yourselves.

Edit: Grammarz

I can't seem to find anything that would be the cause though. 

I know the markets ""unpredictable"" but normally there's reasons for larger drops/gains.   It's not like HAS has a bleak future with the upcoming rights for the starwars toys, plus they own the grand majority of all board games known by the public.

15-12-05,Just noticed NBGGY aka NBG is back alive,"If you owned NBG you got reverse split and now own 1 share of NBGGY for every 15 shares of NBG you had before.  At Friday's closing price of 0.735 that makes each of your NBG shares worth roughly 0.05 now (as I [predicted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3tlrml/nbg_and_grek_holders/cx7dl69) [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3u5zuv/anybody_holding_nbg_bought_3900_shares_at_21_today/cxcgawo)).

&amp;nbsp;

Opinion:  
You're thinking - it can't go any lower, right? That's a pretty common thought with NBG, and based on the last reverse split and dilution I'd say the stock will continue to drop for another 45-60 days before leveling out at a safe value.

&amp;nbsp;

The only difference now is that it isn't even listed on the NYSE anymore, which will probably reduce the dollar amounts being traded significantly.  

&amp;nbsp;

They're also still in the process of selling Finansbank to get the additional capital they need to survive - which will significantly reduce their long term profitability.  My opinion is that this will hurt their share price significantly in the long run, even if retail investors bump the stock price up temporarily on the news.  It ties them much more tightly to the Greek economy than before.

&amp;nbsp;

Any thoughts?

He is certain that our next financial crisis will be from ETF's. If I recall correctly, it's because the money in some ETF's are tied up in bonds. So if the market drops, and people try and sell their ETF's with bonds, people won't be able to get all their money back.

15-12-06,YACHTpportunity in NTES,"Alright you sexy fuckers, let me hit you with some knowledge. NetEase (NTES) is a Chinese gaming pimp, they're the ones that bring shit like Activision's Battle.net to the Asian gamers. And they're gonna give your yachtless ass a one way ticket to the moon.

Disclaimer: I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

NetEase is on a mission to the moons of Jupiter and they're getting there through their newest division NetEase Capital. This is their VC branch with a ""mandate of investing $500mil"" in startup game studios.

Their stock has been rising fast and is reaching new yearly highs on the reg. So when do you get in? I'll fucking tell you.

On July 16, 2014 NetEase Capital invested an undisclosed amount in a US startup, Motiga. Motiga raised $20 in VC from 3 companies, the largest of whom is our baller NetEase (they invested the most of the 3). Motiga is creating a genre-changing game called Gigantic and have partnered with Microsoft to publish Gigantic on Xbone and Win 10 exclusively.

Gigantic started its closed Beta this year and conducted regular weekend playtests. However, a few months ago they announced they were temporarily postponing playtests while they fixed game breaking bugs.

Today Motiga's CEO announced that they will be pushing back the game's release until  early 2016. As a result they have laid off 16 of their 61 employees in order to keep down their costs in the coming months. THAT'S A FOURTH OF THEIR FUCKING STAFF.

Looks like Motiga just shat the bed a bit which is great for you fuckers. If NTES experiences a dip this week then that's your fucking golden ticket on this magical ride. 

Microsoft is banking hard on Gigantic to restores its good graces with the pc gaming community. There's no way they will let this partnership fall short. Motiga will recover in a few months and at that point you're too late to the party.

THIS IS NOT A YOLO. No pump and dump, if you have the capital and the stones, hold this shit tight and don't let go until you're at the moon. It's trading at its yearly high of $179, so wait for the dip and then profit you fucks.

TL;DR: Do your DD on NTES because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

Edit: [This is a website with numbers and buzz words](http://m.nasdaq.com/article/netease-plays-for-keeps-by-diversifying-around-games-cm540294)

Edit 2: Fuck the moon we're going to Infinity and Beyond. To reiterate, NTES distributes Activision's Battle.net to the Asian population. Activision is releasing Overwatch in early 2016. Gainz imminent.",12

15-12-05,Increasing Your Futures Trading Win to Loss Ratio,"http://www.marketsintheory.com/2015/12/increasing-your-trading-win-to-loss.html

Crude Oil 

First look at the defined long term value areas to establish the ultimate imbalanced unfair highs and lows along with the Mid line for support and resistance.

In the video look how a very long term value area 43.20 has been a rock and set up well defined trades to the short. Then look in deeper in to the 30 minute charts on how the migration over time is stair stepping down 43.20 to 41.60 Mid.

41.60 Mid produced trades to the migrating for the short trade. NO need to day trade counter trend as the trades to the short from defined value areas produced longer range winners to the down side thus your Win to Loss Ration would be in great condition.

Emini

One question

Why would you short he ES market?

Since the beginning of November the ES has been trading in an area of balance only for the market to keep rejecting Daily Value High of 2120. From a market that is migrating to the Long the defiant or daring short trader was selling the highs against the markets true intention.

All month long of November and currently the pullbacks have been evidently very strong opportunities to buy from the 2078-2080 Daily Mid Line pumping out long range trades.

The dip below the Daily Mid was reversed again as price just reverted to the long term value area as in-tuned buyers went along for the ride. 

Staying disciplined to the migrating direction your trades would be profound, well defined risk with an outcome of profits and a Win to Loss Ratio that is kicking ass!

I didn't come from a finance background at all and could not tell you the difference between an option and a bond a few months ago. I was hired by a company (don't really want to disclose) and have been in customer service for a few months. They've allowed me to study for 8 hours a day for the past four weeks, including the in person course.

After attending the four day crash course, I felt like I understood everything. I felt extremely confident and that I understand and get the concepts. Then I started taking the q&amp;a practice exams and greenlights. Now I feel incredibly underprepared and the stress is fucking killing me. My highest score is an 80 and on average I'm getting in the low 70s, plus I failed both the greenlight exams in the 60s.

I don't know what else I could have done/could do. I've been studying for 8 hours a day for four weeks. I haven't seen my friends/family, gone out, or done anything fun in this whole time. I'm beginning to get incredibly fucking stressed out over this. I've always been a fairly intelligent person and never really worried about a test before.

Does anyone have any last minute study advice that can hopefully put my mind at ease a little bit? There's only so many more practice exams I can take in the next two days.

Thanks guys!",5

15-12-07,Value investing x swing trading.,"I have a decent understanding of how both value investing and swing trading works, but I've never heard of them combined before, and was looking to get the community's thoughts on it.

The general idea would be that you'd do your due diligence and identify a company that makes a good long term investment, a company that you're very confident will perform well over the next few years or whatever.

The twist is that if this company has some decent volatility (and you've got the time), you'd exploit that by trading in and out, buying in when it dips and selling out when it climbs a percent or two, or whatever you'd find worth skimming off the top.

Since you're invested in this company long term, you wouldn't care if you can't time the bottom correctly, since if it drops you can just stay invested and assume that your due diligence will see you to greener pastures. The only risk I can see here is potentially locking yourself out if you sell and it continues to climb, meaning you'd have to buy in at a loss. 

I've been toying with this approach recently on a small scale with an ETF, which goes up and down a few percent now and then, and find that it scratches the itch to actively invest, while at the same time if I get stuck with the investment I think ""Fuck it, it'll go back up.""

Tl;dr swing trading a company that you're happy to be locked into in the long term.",2

15-12-07,A New Investing SubReddit,"Good Evening, Morning or Afternoon!

I've created a new subreddit entitled ""/r/WallStreetPlays"". Much like the famous SubReddit ""/r/WallStreetBets"", WallStreetPlays is a board for savy investors to gather and discuss plays that involve holding a security anywhere from a few weeks to a few months to as long as 10+ years. 

The rules are also instated to keep us safe. There will be no discussion of stocks under $0.10 unless you have an array of information to present to the moderators to convince us that is is not a pump and dump. These discussions will not be lenient. 

Every stock will be flaired with the appropriate exchange logo. i.e. Stocks on the ""OTCPink"" will recieve an ""OTCPink"" flair. Furthermore; the AutoModerator will also flair stocks that are on the ""caveat emptor"" list or on the FINRA ""Grey Market"" list. The warnings don't stop there. If the books have been manipulated or have ceased to exist; there's a flair for that too!

If MorningStar has stated they've slowed or stopped releasing information; there's a flair for that. All there to keep the investors safe. 

Inspired by the ""Investing"" and ""WallStreetBets"" daily thread; there too will be a post where you can gather and talk about your moves the next day, or, ask questions pertaining to certain positions, but, with that said, we are not your ""Personal DD Army"" (to quote /u/theycallme1). 

We would really love to have your subscription over at the SubReddit. 

Again, it's a place to discuss plays that are riskier then Vanguard but safer then penny stocks. This can include earnings plays, FDA plays or PR plays. 

I've worked extremely hard to make the CSS beautiful and ready for it's ""opening"".

Any suggestions pertaining to the subreddit, anything you'd like to see or any complaints you have, please let us know! We want this to be the SubReddit with the best user experience!

Happy Investing!",0

Many high quality medical journalists have backed it up with positive support, and if it is FDA approved, this could possibly be a cure for cancer. Their stocks have already increased steadily, as shown by the graph in the link.

15-12-07,"$MEIP Announces Positive Results from Phase II Study of Pracinostat in Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Plans to Initiate Phase III Registration Study","According to the oral presentation by principal investigator Dr. Guillermo Garcia-Manero, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 28 of the 50 patients in the study (56%) achieved the primary endpoint of complete response (CR) plus complete response with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) plus morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), including 21 patients (42%) who achieved a CR. Notably, 19 of the 21 patients who achieved a CR are still alive with a 100% one-year survival rate among all CR patients, indicating a correlation between CR and survival with this low intensity therapy.

Median overall survival for all 50 patients in the study has not been reached, with 28 patients still living and a median observation time of 14.3 months. These data compare favorably to a recent international Phase III study of azacitidine (AZA-001)1, which showed a median overall survival of 10.4 months with azacitidine alone and a CR rate of 19.5% in a similar patient population. Median survival among patients with high-risk cytogenetics in this study (n=21) was 13.3 months, more than double the median survival of the high-risk population in the AZA-001 study (6.4 months).

""These are impressive results by virtually any measure for a group of patients in dire need of effective new treatment options,"" said Dr. Garcia-Manero. ""Not only did we observe a high rate of responses, but many occurred rapidly and continued to improve with ongoing therapy. Most importantly, we are seeing an encouraging trend in overall survival, particularly among patients who achieved a complete response. These data clearly support further development of Pracinostat in combination with azacitidine for the treatment of elderly patients with AML.""

The open-label study enrolled a total of 50 patients at 15 centers across the U.S. Median age in the study was 76 years. Patients received 60 mg of Pracinostat orally three times a week for three weeks followed by one week of rest and 75 mg m2 of azacitidine via subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion for the first seven days of each 28-day cycle. The combination of Pracinostat and azacitidine was generally well tolerated in the study, with no unexpected toxicities. The most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events reported in &gt;10% of all patients included febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia and fatigue.

""We are very excited about our growing body of AML data, which continues to exceed expectations and guide us forward with the development of this program,"" said Daniel P. Gold, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of MEI Pharma. ""Over the past several months we have learned that our randomized study of Pracinostat and azacitidine in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was hindered by a high rate of discontinuations due to adverse events, but appeared to show a benefit for patients who were able to tolerate treatment for at least four cycles compared to azacitidine alone. The results from our AML study demonstrate that many patients are achieving responses within the first two cycles, with fewer discontinuations overall due to adverse events compared to our MDS study, suggesting a prudent development path forward for the combination.

""Based on these findings,"" continued Dr. Gold, ""we will now begin to prepare for a Phase III registration study of Pracinostat and azacitidine in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML, which we plan to initiate in the second half of 2016. We look forward to sharing more information regarding the design of this study in the months ahead.""",12

15-12-07,Maxing HSA vs. Roth,"I'd like to get some feedback on the pros and cons of maxing out an HSA vs. a Roth account. I don't think I can max both, so I'm trying to figure out what makes the most sense.

My employer offers an HSA through WageWorks, with my employer contributing $2,500 annually. The annual deductible is $3,000, so my max out-of-pocket is $500, which we will definitely use up in 2016, and then all expenses are paid by the insurance plan. 

We can contribute up to $4,250 to the HSA, which carries over from year to year and can be used tax free for medical expenses, or I understand you can withdraw from it after 65 and it's much like withdrawing from a 401k or Traditional IRA in terms of taxes. 

Contributions are not taxed, either, so the tax benefits seem to be the biggest advantage (on top of having money put aside if any major medical expenses pop up). 

So my primary question: Would it be worth prioritizing maxing out this HSA account before maxing out my Roth? ",3

15-12-07,"SHORT $AAPL -- Apple ""Faces Risk Of Inventory Correction"": Three Channel Checks Confirm Deteriorating iPhone Sales","One week ago we reported something unpleasant for the world's largest company: China Daily had reported that Apple's key Taiwanese supplier, Pegatron, had halted hiring ""due to poor iPhone sales."" Today, Credit Suisse confirms much of the cautions laid out previously in a note in which it says ""iPhone supply chain orders have weakened recently. In our view, the continued weak supply chain news could weigh on Apple shares for the next few weeks/quarters."" 

As a result of the change in sales expectations, the Swiss bank is lowering its CY16 EPS estimates by 6%, but since it doesn't want to get on Tim Cook's bad side, says that it continues to ""believe that with high retention rates, continued installed base growth, and the optionality of a smaller 4-inch iPhone, Apple remains an Outperform."" 

In other words, the current weakness, previewed here, is ""transitory"", or so CS hopes.

Here are the details from Credit Suisse' note on Supply-chain cuts:






Production cuts. Apple has lowered its component orders by as much as 10% according to our teams in Asia. The cuts seem to be driven by weak demand for the new iPhone 6s, as overall builds are now estimated to be below 80mn units for the December quarter and between 55-60mn units for the March quarter. We lower our CY16 units to 222mn from 242mn to reflect this and assume 235mn for 2017 (6% growth y/y).

 

Downward revisions anticipated, but coming sooner and deeper. The downward revisions came in earlier (November 2015, versus December 2015) and deeper (by 10% versus earlier expectations by 5%) than anticipated. We believe the softer- than-expected demand could be due to (1) currency volatility, (2) the lack of attractive Apps supporting the new force touch function (which has been the key selling point of iPhone 6s), and (3) macro uncertainties.

 

Data points suggest a weaker 1Q16. Current data points suggest the production cuts are mostly in the December quarter. However, as the new smartphones have only been available in the market for one month, we believe 1Q16 cuts could be potentially more significant. As a result, we now expect the component supply chain to see a single-digit YoY decline in 4Q15, and ~20% YoY decline in 1Q16. The aggregate number of iPhone builds is now expected to be in the range of 55mn to 60mn in production in the first quarter of 2016.

 

Pegatron sets solid 4Q guidance. For assemblers, 4Q15 earnings appear solid based on guidance, but 1H16 may be at risk due to iPhone. iPhone component cuts could lead to 1H16 risks for assemblers. Apple may shift to greater 6s orders to Pegatron as Hon Hai is exclusive on the new 4"" model. We expect Pegatron to ship 22/18mn iPhones in 4Q15/1Q16 and 66mn/70mn in CY15/16.

 

Is the supply chain a good read? It is worth remembering that Apple's supply chain is vast with an additional complication with the timing between Apple's sell-in and sell-through numbers. Additionally, what is important to note with these estimates is the strong correlation (R = 0.95) between production builds and reported sales, as shown in Exhibit 2 over time

**My Analysis**





**Problem:**



As a client relations manager at a financial institution, I have definitely experienced this pain point and have discussed it on many occasions with my co-workers. It can be really tough keeping track of connections, especially those that I meet at events or around the city. 





**Solution:**


The idea of being able to pose a simple search seems super powerful. Also, not having to manually go through all of my contacts and build a personal CRM is going to make adoption incredibly easy. I see this as not only an effective solution to the problem, but also one that will likely scale quickly. 





**Market:**


I like that they know who their initial target market is. I’d like to see them get a bit more granular into who the first segment is that they plan to target since that will improve messaging and lead to more conversions. But the initial addressable market is pretty favorable, especially if the subscription price point is somewhere around $10 a month (averaging the different levels). That would make $100m is ARR completely achievable in 2 years. 





**Team:**

Strong educational background. Education is not everything, but it shows a strong foundation. Would like to see more experience in data science. Really like the male/female founding team dynamics.





**Competitive Advantage:**


Don’t really see empathy as a key competitive advantage, nor a sustainable one. That’s merely an expectation of any company if they are going to be successful. Not a patent expert, but having IP definitely makes the company more defensible if their algorithm is really strong. 





**Business Model:**


SaaS model is pretty common and I think it makes sense for the most part. Especially if they can leverage freemium to drive user acquisition and convert a substantial percentage into paying customers. Need to see more numbers on LTV and CAC to ensure that the unit economics check out. Likely too early though to know.

Step 2. Wait til it dries (usually overnight for me)


Step 3. Scratch it until it's a fine powder


Step 4. Snort the shit out of it


Step 5. ?????????


Step 6. Massive overhead on blow avoided


Usually just beat off after a day of trading so you can get your load ready for the next day. It's an unlimited perpetual yolo machine. Your massive gains gives you enough brotein to beat off, and you snorting your dried up soldiers allows you to get more massive gains.

It seems like there's no activity for this stock and I can't really find any other info it.  So I still have 1,000 shares of it but it's worth almost nothing.

15-12-08,Should I Pay Off my Student Loan Debts First or Invest in an Index Fund?,"I am an Albertan currently about $8,000 in debt from student loans. Roughly $5,500 of this $8,000 is an Alberta Student Loan, while the rest ($2,500) is from the National Student Loans Service Centre (Canadian Student Loan). I think that the $5,500 will have an interest rate of approximately 3% per year, while the NSLSC loan charges approximately 5% interest per year.

Now, I recently invested into the VOO vanguard S&amp;P 500 index fund. I also researched that the average return on investment on the S&amp;P 500 is approximately 10% per year (so long as you keep the investment in for 30 years or more).

So, I currently have about $7000 in cash, which I could use to pay off my student loan debt, or put it into the VOO fund.

The way I see it, if I did not pay off the loan for 41 years, it would grow to about $35541.17. As well, if I put the 7000 into VOO and let it sit for 41 years, it would grow to $316814.78. I would then have a profit of about $281273.60.

It seems to me if I used the $7000 to instead pay off my debt now, I would be making the more ""foolish"" decision. However, I may be missing something, since everyone around me seems to think paying off one's student debts are always a financial priority greater than investing.

Additional information: I am also going back to university for another 4 years to pursue a degree in commerce, which will total to another $30,000 in loan debt.

15-12-07,$LULU and NKE earnings,"Here is my analysis. 

1. NKE: It has beat earnings in the last three quarters and is poised to do it this time around too. It is trading around its SMA with reasonable volume which tells me people are holding back to see which way the earnings go and then get in. Another factor is the 2:1 split thats going to happen on 23rd Dec. 
 Historically the IV of this stock has reduced significantly post earnings. This tells me that a short straddle might be a good trade if I can collect a lot of premium now. On checking the IV on the options chain, I see Dec 24 expiration has reasonable premium and low IV. A 132 short straddle pays me $8.5 in premium and a POP=67% based on HV data and 60% based on IV data. So, Maximum profit is $850. 

2. LULU:  This is a riskier trade because of low liquidity in the options chain. Hence, I want to take a very small position in the form of buying 1 call or a put. TA signals a buy according to MACD indicator. The technical analysis in my opinion doesn't hold well during earnings as there might be significant gap up or down. The news on this seems positive mostly so I'm going with calls on this one.  The weeklys 51 call trading for $2.93 have good volume and high IV. YOLO.

Here is what /u/dvdmovie1 said:
&gt; JAB has bought DB Master Blenders Coffee/Tea, Einstein Bagels, Caribou Coffee and Peet's Coffee, as well as now Keurig. Coffee roll-up and maybe they're not done yet, but I'm guessing they're going to pull all of this together into a new, larger coffee co, complete with retail, grocery and machines. I certainly wouldn't say watch out Starbucks, but JAB may be able to make a pretty decent competitor and it will be interesting to see where they ultimately go with this.

Actually, this is a **big win for Starbucks**.  History and any decent industrial-organization textbook will tell you that industry-consolidation is good for producers and bad for consumers.  

It is reasonable to assume that Keurig and Starbucks share the same costumer-base.  Keurig machines became popular in the US at the beginning of 2008 but despite this continued increase in competition *stationed in their customers' very own homes*, [Starbucks' share-price has increased a little over 500% since then.](http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1449522000000&amp;chddm=780827&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NASDAQ:SBUX&amp;ntsp=1&amp;ei=R-ZlVpn6KJC0iALJ86TwCg). ([Keurig increased nearly 900% in the same period.](http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1449522000000&amp;chddm=780827&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NASDAQ:GMCR&amp;ntsp=1&amp;ei=WuZlVtm-J-30igLb7KrICw))  The point I'm making here is that even in a period of increasing, effective competition among US coffee-retailers, both Keurig and Starbucks have performed magnificently from a shareholder's perspective.  With time, as the consolidation progresses, the decrease in competition will grant greater monopolistic-power to these two companies, and increased profits are sure to follow.

That was the past, but what about going forward?  When evaluating publicly traded equities, one of my favorite tools is Google Trends, which I use as a semi-reliable proxy for consumer-demand of a given product and/or as a means of evaluating the popularity of a brand.  [According to Google Trends, since 2004, interest in Starbucks from various nations has been growing, while US and Canadian interest in Keurig, where the company's interest is primarily located, has flatlined.](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=Keurig%2C starbucks&amp;cmpt=q&amp;tz=Etc%2FGMT%2B8)  

Keurig would do well to shift focus from the domestic market and move into the same developing-economies that Starbucks is leading into: let Starbucks blaze the trail, then move in after to deliver to Starbucks' foreign customers an affordable, at-home convenience.  Starbucks is essentially spinning-off demand for a quality-cup of coffee, and all Keurig has to do is be there to catch it and say, ""Hey! We've got a great, convenient machine to do just that, all from your own home... just like Americans do!""  (Success of a Starbucks store in a developing-economy should be taken as a highly reliable proxy that the consumers there have the demand and the cash to purchase a Keurig machine.)  In summary, economically speaking, Keurig's products are *complimentary goods* with respect to Starbucks so long as Starbucks blazes the trail into the new market.

Additional comments: 1) Keurig should avoid Europe at all costs, unless it plans to hit-up JAB Holding Company (German) for additional capital with which to move into the developing-economies after Starbucks, 2) JAB Holding Company is already being criticized for the premium it paid for Keurig, but JAB has demonstrated shrewdness in its intercontinental coffee roll-up, so I'm confident JAB has the brains and bank to help expand Keurig into new markets, 3) Nestle, the [world-leader in coffee](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-keurig-green-m-a-jab-idUSKBN0TQ1NA20151207), has, like most conglomerates, faltered in competing with Keurig and will likely see a decrease in its market-share of coffee, 4) I purchased 191 shares of GMCR on 11/11/15 @ $48.52/share on a hunch that Keurig had something up-its-sleeve regarding its R&amp;D.  While I was not expecting a buyout of the company, I'm thrilled by it and sold all 191 shares today for $89.20/share.

They have a crazy cool marketing plan that includes [encouraging you to steal their ads](http://designtaxi.com/news/380448/JetBlue-Gives-Away-Free-Flights-Baseball-Tickets-To-People-Who-Steal-Its-Ads/) and [good ole holiday spirit]( http://designtaxi.com/news/362876/US-Airline-Offers-Free-Flights-To-Passengers-Traveling-Home-For-Christmas/) 

“That’s great Snuffle, but who the fuck cares, that is all baked into the price right?”

Yes and no. 

 Yes, everyone knows this company is nice, but expenses like free shit and great flight experiences **must** be a burden.  Will their crafty marketing scheme eventually fizzle, and the big boys push them out of the market? 
Legitimate concerns, but I am still optimistic

15-12-08,TSE:WJX - ?Oversold?,"https://www.google.com/finance?cid=666178

This is not DD, it is simply a brief question regarding a screen. Disclosure: I'm a pleb at active investing and have a mostly passive portfolio, though I hope to change this in the next 6-12 months. I am doing some stock screens and was hoping for a general WSB opinion on this small-cap CAD stock regarding simply whether or not it seems oversold. WJX is an industrial stock sold on the TSE. The company designs, sells and services various power systems and industrial components. 

From a price perspective, they are trading near 52-week lows ($15 range) and have been as high as 33$/share in the past year with fairly steep declines in late 2015. They are also dishing out a 6% dividend or so. Market Cap is currently below Book value ($300 vs $330 million). I can't find a great reason for their stock dipping almost 50% in the past 6-8 weeks other than past quarterly EPS that fell slightly below expectations. From a balance sheet perspective they look fairly stable in terms of assets ($700 mil range) and look to have a steadily declining total liabilities ($380 mil currently), improved $18 million from last quarter. I'm shit at reading cash flows so no comments there. 

From a basic technical perspective, the stock has been trading below its 15D SMA for about 6 weeks and is trading well below its 50D SMA. RSI is in the oversold range at 21. Volume is generally lower than average over the past several weeks. 

Fundamentally this stock looks way oversold to me and basic technicals seem reassuring. Either tell me why I should go fuck myself or give your opinions/feedback! Thanks",4

15-12-08,"Everyone here needs to get familiar with something called Monero and Cryptonote. Even as cryptocurrency moves out of the nerd's basement - the greatest crypto-asset has yet to begin its ascent.","If you know me, you will know that I have spent years studying and reading about money.  In my stock trading days, I made some good picks and enjoyed the support and arrogance of many members of this community.  But honestly?  I've made the most progress while learning about the *nature* of money itself.  
  
I've spent the last 2+ years reading about cryptocurrencies non-stop.  I also have been pretty dead-on as far as bitcoin adoption in the past few years.  
  
So let me take a moment and tell you that the next 'big' thing may not be bitcoin at all, but it's overlooked (and secretly more attractive sister).  
  
This is a subject that could fill a book but I'll outline several key points to pique your interest in hopes you'll do your own DD.  It's not too hard to actually own Monero, but I'm not here to pump up something I already own - I hope that you will do the research and come to the same conclusion that I have: the ascent of crypto is inevitable, as is the ascent of Monero.  
  
**Critical Point #1:**  The financial sector is rife with talks of the 'blockchain'.  But you simply cannot separate the blockchain from bitcoin, as much as Goldman Sachs and Blythe Masters would like to.  This is the foolish equivalent of Russia claiming they don't like the internet so they are committing themselves to building their *own* internet.  
  
Bitcoin is an open-source network, and with any open-source and decentralized financial network things are proceeding as they should - often chaotic with many surges and crashes on the way to ultimate stability (which occur at a much higher price point than now).  
  
**Critical Point #2**: Bitcoin is remarkable in that it advanced money in a very real way beyond what was currently possible but it is *not* the holy grail of digital money that many computer scientists and economists had dreamed of.  
  
Consider the following chart:  http://postimg.org/image/aqjmkgusp/  
  
- We had decentralized and private money for thousands of years with gold.  
- The 'digital dollar' gave us digital and private money (to some degree - banks and processing institutions still had to track you to process your money).  
- Bitcoin came along gave us digital money that no entity owned for the first time but at a cost: everyone can browse every bitcoin transaction back to the beginning of time.  This is obviously unsuitable as a default behavior of a currency - privacy must be built-in, it cannot be some optional add on feature.  Imagine having to obscure every sensitive credit card transaction you make so that it wouldn't be totally public knowledge.  
- Monero (as the largest and most successful implementation of the Cryptonote protocol) emerged from anonymous sources in 2014.  It is not some stock, or some silly nerd toy.  It is no less than the *holy grail of digital money itself* combining for the first time in human history the elements of digital, decentralized, and private.  
  
How does it do this?  By way of something called ""cryptographic ring signatures"".  You can either trust the egg heads who designed it that it works like magic, or develop the ph.D level mathematical knowledge to verify it yourself.  Either way, know this is likely one of the most sophisticated computational objects our species has ever created.  
  
Not only that but it also improves many fundamental aspects of Bitcoin:  
  
- Not happy that Bitcoin is deflationary?  Monero has a small perpetual tail emission that means that miners will always have more Monero to mine.  (after the initial 18.4 million, approximately 400k per year will be minable in perpetuity)  
- Not happy with the blocksize debates raging across the Bitcoin landscape?  Monero uses a variable size blocksize and a per-kb fee so that those debates will never happen on this blockchain.  
- Worried about total privacy being banned by the law (and more likely the IRS)?  Well Monero has **two** keys.  One is a private key that lets you spend your money, and the other is a view key that lets you (or another trusted party) view your balance without actually giving them access to spend it.  
  
This is not a stock, or a commodity.  This is not some get rich scheme (although many will get rich in the coming years on it).  This is nothing less than the new dominant form of money for our entire global civilization.  
  
And you are one of the very lucky few who just learned about it first.  
  
The future will be filled with anonymous money transactions whizzing through the internet at the speed of light, instantly and with no one's permission.  The fees will be a micro-fraction of what are being paid today, and it will be just like the birth of the internet all over again.  
  
This is the 2020's staring you in the face, folks.  
  
Don't be left behind: Educate yourself.  
  
Yes, Monero are only 30 to 60 cents each at the moment, and yes if they succeed in becoming the dominant private financial network on Earth then that per-unit price will likely go to some absurd number that you wouldn't believe if I told you.  You probably wouldn't have believed that 50 cent bitcoins in 2011 would be worth over $1000 by 2014, but it still happened.  
  
That's not the point though - to create a brand new, decentralized financial network from nothing you have to make a few people rich.  There is no other way to do it.  The point is that the future of finance is in cryptography and blockchains and you need to either understand it or retain the talent that does if you hope to continue to be a relevant player over the next 20 years.  
  
If you have any serious inquiries about Monero or blockchains, I will be happy to answer them here and you are always welcome to join us over on /r/monero for more talk about Cryptonote or our project.  If you were one of the one's who scoffed at Bitcoin (like I did) in 2009 - 2012 even as it began it's meteoric ascent, this is your moment of redemption.  
  
Let's not make the same mistakes.  
  
Thanks for your time.

15-12-08,New sub for options traders to supplement WSB,"https://www.reddit.com/r/WSBOptions/

Some recent threads and discussions have informed me that there are a lot of community members on this sub that are relatively small traders, and this sub often focuses on a lot of biotech plays and/or penny stocks.  That's all great, people are at different stages in life, like to trade different things, etc.  Love this place.

But I thought it would be helpful for those that are either now trading or want to get into trading what I'll call 
""informed, but high-risk"" options to have a sister sub to this one.  

That means not discussing what biotech to trade call options on hoping for a pop - but rather trading multi-leg strategies on high-volume stocks.  

I am admittedly a noob at this but the reasons we need a forum for this, for those that have the capital to trade in these securities:

1. They are not zero sum games.  Trading in these low liquidity biotechs WSB is often trading against itself.  Trading options on larger-cap stocks there's money to be made for all of us

2.  These options plays can generate extreme amounts of return from the perspective of actual $ if you have the capital to trade them.  I see people in here talking about making a few hundred if and when some biotech pops, when meanwhile you can make that on a single trades in very blue chip stocks

3.  For those that are here because they need the YOLO thrill from trading and haven't dabbled in these trades, I can tell you that there's no tension like wondering, for example, if I'm going to get stuck with $50k in Chipotle stock because some college kids can't stop pooping themselves.

So come on over, may be slow to get up and running, open to all suggestions.  I love the banter here but I think this will lend itself to a more straightforward type of discussion.

First, they were just upgraded to ""buy"" from Merrill Lynch and were added to their US 1 list recently (a collection of their best investment ideas that are drawn from the universe of “Buy” rated US-listed stocks). They have a buy rating from Merrill, Morningstar, and others.

One of the biggest ""downside risks"" I've seen listed is rising natural gas costs.  I think we've all seen natural gas costs drop significantly -- which has hurt some of the nat gas stocks I own.

The stock is down 30% in recent months, but this is largely due to nitrogen prices dropping (and the risk that their tax inversion deal fails).  I've read that while nitrogen prices dropping is seasonal in nature, this drop has been longer and later than typical. 

I think this stock has pretty strong upside (not today or tomorrow, but if you hold for more than a few months), and they offer a decent dividend - $1.20, I believe.

I began in April and when researching Nintendo, I noticed that in March they made a huge jump from 14$ to 22$ over the course of two days from March 16th to 18th. I didn't want to invest because in April the stock continually seemed to be going up and down. Since October it has began declining and today it is at 18.46, a low that it hasn't reached since April 2nd. A lot of talk about Nintendo's new NX console is beginning to spread and I was wondering if now is a good time to get into Nintendo while it's low. When the Wii was released Nintendo stocks hovered from $60-80 but the company had much less success with the release of the Wii U. 


Their have been announcements of Nintendo claiming the NX will be much differently than the Wii U so they are most likely attempting to go back to consumer demands in order to dominate the gaming market again, instead of being unique and different with the wii u, which didn't get them the sales they wanted. There have also been announcements of Nintendo entering the mobile market in the future which could also improve their worth substantially because as many people know, the mobile market in Japan and Korea is massive.

15-12-08,TSE: WJX ?Oversold?,"X-post from r/wallstreetbets where there weren't any responses

https://www.google.com/finance?cid=666178

This is not DD, it is simply a brief question regarding a screen. Disclosure: I'm a pleb at active investing and have a mostly passive portfolio, though I hope to change this in the next 6-12 months. I am doing some stock screens and was hoping for a general r/investing opinion on this small-cap CAD stock regarding simply whether or not it seems oversold. WJX is an industrial stock sold on the TSE. The company designs, sells and services various power systems and industrial components.

From a price perspective, they are trading near 52-week lows ($15 range) and have been as high as 33$/share in the past year with fairly steep declines in late 2015. They are also dishing out a 6% dividend or so. Market Cap is currently below Book value ($300 vs $330 million). P/E of 8 is very much on the low side historically. I can't find a great reason for their stock dipping almost 50% in the past 6-8 weeks other than past quarterly EPS that fell slightly below expectations. From a balance sheet perspective they look fairly stable in terms of assets ($700 mil range) and look to have a steadily declining total liabilities ($380 mil currently), improved $18 million from last quarter. I'm shit at reading cash flows so no comments there.

From a basic technical perspective, the stock has been trading below its 15D SMA for about 6 weeks and is trading well below its 50D SMA. RSI is in the oversold range at 21. Volume is generally lower than average over the past several weeks.

Fundamentally this stock looks way oversold to me and technicals seem reassuring. Looking for your thoughts or constructive criticism, thanks",7

15-12-08,[Noob advice needed] Can someone help me understand KBIO in the past few weeks? (And other Biotech questions),"Hey, I've been playing in the virtual free stock markets just so I can get a feel of how everything works. I think I'm ok with the terminology but not so much in how a company works. I have an interest in biotech companies and chose to follow KBIO and a couple others as a starting point. Had a few questions:

1. What does the addition of a new CEO offer to a stocks company? A few weeks ago Martin Shkrieli was appointed CEO and the stock skyrocketed following that. Is it because of his value to the company or anything else? From what I understand, he purchased majority of shares and that's what caused the huge price increase? Does that normally happen when someone purchases majority?

2. What makes this a bullish stock? What does bullish even mean?

3. CEO appointed new chief officers and the stock has gone down since then. Not specifically in regards to KBIO, but what does the addition of new chief officers do to the value of a company?

4. My understanding of the Phase trials is that it if its effective, then the company can market the product. For example PTLA just passed a phase 3 trial for a Factor Xa inhibitor which there are none on the market. What are the things I should be looking at from a positive phase 3 trial and the company from an investing stand point?

15-12-08,We have them right where they want us.,"Most of you know over the last month I have adopted this [Startrek] running gag as result of trend lines that made the appearance of the [Starship Enterprise](http://i.imgur.com/QMMzd70.png) look visible on the S&amp;P. I ran with it because it was actually pretty funny and to my surprise continued to play out exactly as I jokingly said it would. But this title quote is more of actual relevance than satire or sarcasm this time. For those that are unaware this was famously said by Kirk when pretending to investigate an alien threat right before striking them a mortal blow. The idea was to be where the enemy expects you but with out letting on that you actually have them right where you want them. In poker this would be the same as slowing playing a top hand so your opponent thinks hes in control allowing him to be more arrogant while you patiently set and then finally close the trap and take all of his chips.

With respect to the markets we have the Fed exactly where they want us. They have a crap hand right now and we know it. World wide debt is deflating despite all central banks best efforts to keep inflating and money is literally disappearing out of the system as the debt is being destroyed faster than its being created. We have reached the limit of central bank debt creation as a driver for growth as the amount that we borrow is being sponged up by the interest on the amount currently owed. In engineering we call this the law of diminishing returns. Due to loss the amount of energy required to increase the gain grows larger than the gain achieved until the energy source reaches maximum capacity. The Feds capacity to generate growth has stalled under the loss or existing cost of service the previous gains and they are now trapped and attempting to bluff its way out of this hand. If they don't raise rates they signal to the world that the recovery is false and the market will continue go down not just from deflationary pressure but also from a loss of faith in the Fed its self. Liquidity will dry up until a Lehman type credit event takes place and their credibility as saviors will evaporate into the crashing cataclysm that will be the stock market. If they pretend everything is fine and raise rates they only exacerbate the problem as that will remove liquidity even faster. They will maintain some credibility before the credit event happens but will have shorten there time line on how long they have before it occurs. There is a reason they have put it off so long and its because they know a rate increase pulls forward the credit event that will trigger the next collapse.

They are pretending that everything is fine because they have too and they need us to keep our money in the stock market or else when the index falls the average retail investor that has his money in the stock market will get spooked and pull it out and the whole thing unwinds. Those of us in this sub are not retail investors. We don't buy large caps and hold for dividends or 2%-5% annual gains in hopes of retiring in a nice older community someday with rec-center and spa. No we Yolo and want the money, bitches and the yacht. We know this market is coming down and have placed our bets but have been burned trying to time the crash and get our Yolo right. Its been one bad beat after the next. Pocket aces getting smashed by 7-2 off suit on the river by a donk with an unlimited chip stack that will chase everything. Its frustrating and maddening to watch the manipulation day in and day out. When will it all end. When is judgment day?

To all that and in final summary I would say that the day is close at hand. From my [first chart](http://i.imgur.com/QMMzd70.png) that first showed the pattern emerging and the [second chart](http://i.imgur.com/MyCmDz3.png) and [third chart](http://i.imgur.com/XUS1xFc.png) that showed it continuing I had an expectation that the Fed doesn't want the market to get to hot or spooked before the rate hike so that way they can spin it as a positive and even ramp the market higher after the announcement. But something happened this last week that that changes the narrative. The volatility has been all over the place. 2% back to back round trips in a matter of days on the indexes is hardly a smooth and orderly consolidation into what the Fed is trying to down play as a positive announcement. It looks as though [something has broke](http://i.imgur.com/78ylu1s.png) in the markets and investors are getting spooked before the Fed can signal the all clear. The Fed appears to be losing control. In the wake of all this volatility I am revising my forecast that I think a large downward move in the books before the rate hike even happens. The market is telling us something has broken while the Fed is telling us that everything is ok. The Fed may have the retail investor right where they want them... [but we know the outcome](http://i.imgur.com/v6XxoQj.jpg)... and right here, right now, we have the Fed right where they want us.


TL:DR. The Fed wants the markets calm so they can juice the rate hike but the volatility in the last few days suggest something has broken and we may see a large downward move occur before the Fed rate hike even takes place.

The volatility today was entertaining.  Roller coaster back and forth.  It seemed like shorts were nervous.  After opec all got together for dinner Bears had their finger on the trigger.  Now the safety is on. 

On the last dip a few months back prices had a huge increase on news of Saudi reports saying they want oil prices above 44.  All Saudis have to do is mention what they are eating for breakfast and boom.  Shorts exit position and buy in on strength.  

My hope is to see a rise to 44-47 in the next 30 -45 days.  I predict a drop to test 37 again but if we hold 36, bulls could have a base to work with. 

Everyone and their brother is taking about oversupply. OPEC might as well play board games if Saudis don't step in.

15-12-08,"FFHL - Next Chinese Pump &amp; Dump??? YOLO!","Just before the great sub-prime crash many years ago, when China was red hot, there were lots of ""reverse buyouts"" of small companies with very low floats.  A reverse buyout was the easiest way for the Chinese to gain hold of a U.S. listed public company without going through the scrutiny and costs of an IPO.  These stocks shot to the moon for a very short period as they were part of an organized pump &amp; dump scheme.  I've kept an eye out on some of these.

EFUT was such a stock.  It has recently (within past few days) come back from it's great sleep.  Would have been great to get in on the ground floor, but it's very difficult to call which stock will be pumped next.

FFHL has been dormant for years.  6.1M float.  And look at the volume today, without the price moving much.  Earlier this year, the company was bought from the Chinese government.  The Chinese government had taken it over a few years ago from the previous guys who had done the pump and dumps in the pre-sub prime era.  The stock recently got the Nasadq warning letter for a desisting as it's price was under $1.  Within the warning period, they raised the price to above $1, saving their listing on the exchange.  It has since gone under $1, but they haven't received a warning letter (yet).  Just the fact that they lifted the price above $1, it means there is still interest.  And they are waiting on a good time for another pump &amp; dump.

So based on the fact that it's a low float Chinese company, that it's sister (EFUT) has recently rocketed, and the heavy volume today, I think we're getting very close to this taking off.  

This is YOLO.  This is not an investment.  We couldn't care less about what they do (they're into plastics).  I predict this will go between $10-$20, but for a very short period.  Buy now, and get out on the spike.

When will it happen?  I'm estimating in the next 3 months.  $2,000 in these poker chips can turn into $20,000.  

I own 5,000 shares at 78 cents/share.  Good luck!  ",14

Due to the massive selling that has occurred in oil stocks recently, this spread has blown out tremendously ($LINE now trades at 60% premium to $LNCO). This could be due to tax-loss selling, $LNCO being a lesser known, less liquid security than $LINE, or other reasons that I am not aware of.

Upon view of the historical spread between both stocks, there was one occurrence where LINE traded at a 30% premium, but this gap closed quickly.

PLEASE NOTE: I have not done deep due diligence as to cause of this divergence, and therefore there may be a reason for it that I am not aware of.

-----

[Graph they are referring to](http://i.imgur.com/kvOPKwQ.png)


- There have only been 2 bear markets that have been more aggressive than this one – 

&gt;The move into the low in 2008 (77.9%), and

&gt;The move into the low in 1986 (just over 69%)

- As we know full well, the 2008 move came with a global crisis and panic across markets, which we do not see now so it is unreasonable to think we could fall by the same 77.9% we did then (so far this move down has been 66.5% down)

- The move down into the 1986 low was just over 69% which is a little more than what we have seen here so far.

- IF it were to repeat (not our base case) then we could see a move down towards the $33.89-$34.45 area on WTI

- For now, we cannot confirm a bearish break unless and until we get a weekly close below the August low of $37.80.

- While a move towards the $34 area is feasible (again, not our base case scenario), we suspect we are seeing the final stages of a bear trend rather than anything fresh. Also, considering WTI was down more than 5% overnight, a move like that (if it were to happen) may not take very long.

- Employees: 40 shares (16%)

Total: 240 shares

So it means that if I start with 5 shares of the company, I will own more less 2% (5/2.4) by the end of it.

Do these calculations make any sense? Is it realistic to assume that it will only go from 100 to something like 240 shares or am I completely off?",0

15-12-09,"Warren Buffet's Advice: Billionaire's Top Tips for Achieving Financial Independence","I found this article on www.stanbits.com
It's about warren buffet experience and the beginning of his carrer.

Businessman and venture capitalist – Warren Buffett is arguably the most successful investor of the 20th century (if not of all time). Buffett began investing at the early age of 11, and by the time he was 13 he was already running a small business as a paperboy. Fun fact: that same year, little Warren filed his first tax return, claiming his bike as a $35 tax deduction.

Warren Buffett was almost certainly born with business in his blood; however, his words of wisdom can benefit your financial life as well (regardless of your blood chemistry). Although he is now in his mid 80s, Buffett has still yet to write a book. He definitely has enough knowledge for a small non-fiction series, though. Regardless, his voice remains the most respected and trusted amongst both, investment professionals and the investing public.

That being said, let’s take a look at what financial knowledge the Oracle of Omaha is willing to share. Saving his best investment advice for a little bit later, let’s first address Buffett’s more general financial tips for the average Joe.

Buffett strongly advises everyone to limit what they borrow. He claims that it’s simply not possible to become rich by living on borrowed money – which makes sense (to most people, at least).

I’ve seen more people fail because of liquor and leverage – leverage being borrowed money. You really don’t need leverage in this world much. If you’re smart, you’re going to make a lot of money without borrowing.

Now that you are familiar with Buffett’s thoughts on loans, you need to start thinking of borrowing money as a ‘non option’. If, however, there is no other choice and you absolutely need to borrow some money, you should do so with an objective assessment of future cash flow. If you don’t have a solid plan to pay this debt off you will become a slave to the interest (perhaps even for life).

With Buffett being most recognized as an investor, let’s see what he has to say regarding stock.

In his 1989 letter to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett claims that…
It’s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.

Clearly, buying a stock is about much more than just the price. Finding a ‘wonderful’ company that you believe in, and ignoring gloomy economic and stock market forecasts may seem like risky business; and although it might be, it has worked for Buffett many times over. Coca-Cola being a prime example of a (at least financially) wonderful company that Buffett was smart enough to invest in.

All this talk about “wonderful” companies raises some confusion.

What exactly is a wonderful company? Well, although it’s hard to quantify “wonderful”, Buffett has probably done it. According to the financial wiz – a “wonderful business” includes the following:

The business has to be understandable. You should be able to tell quite easily what the company is about.
There should also be a good return on the capital without much debt.
Cash flow should show profit, and the earnings are predictable.
Their franchises are strong, and they have the freedom to price the product as they see fit.
Finally the company shouldn’t take a genius to run, and the management must be owner-oriented.

Pretty solid advice. It’s definitely a good idea to include at least one such ‘wonderful’ company in your portfolio. If you’re patient enough, a wonderful company should (according to Buffett) always be worth the investment.

When investing it’s important to first understand the investment pyramid, and then develop an investment strategy. Consulting professional advisors regularly to review and diversify your investments is also a great idea. Like Buffett famously said –

Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.

It’s human nature to want to make more money, and it’s very common to see potential investment opportunities that promise high returns. These offers are so mouthwateringly tempting that we fail to objectively analyze the higher risk that comes with these high rewards. As hard as it may be, it’s vital to stay disciplined and set all emotion aside when playing the investment game.

Since Warren Buffett himself holds a very disciplined investment style, it comes as no surprise that he is a strong promoter of patience in investing. Buffett claims that trying to get rich quick is a mistake, and that – “It’s pretty easy to get well-to-do slowly. But it’s not easy to get rich quick.”

Pretty much all of Buffett’s advice can be summed up in a classic idiom – slow and steady wins the race. Over the years, this idiom has become Buffett’s mantra, and this approach consistently outperformed the market for decades, making Warren a billionaire many times over.

Another great Buffett quote regarding long-term thinking can be found in the 1986 letter to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. 

The quote reads:
No matter how great the talent or efforts, some things just take time. You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.

Now, that’s a good point. Buffett argues that money is part of nature, not something that can grow overnight. Most people make the mistake of overestimating what they think they’ll make in a year, and underestimating the potential earnings of a decade. Sticking to the Buffett Principle, you can make money without constantly changing portfolios, simply by staying invested for the long term.

Life is like a snowball. The important thing is finding wet snow (opportunities) and a really long hill (long term).

This Buffett classic connects quite well with the idea of waiting for your investments to pay off. Investing with long-term plans in mind can be stressful, but it’s important not to panic while seeing short-term fluctuations. You only lose money when you sell, however, if you have the backbone to wait it out, you just might come out on top, after all –

Over the long term, the stock market news will be good.

I think it’s fair to say that Buffett is in the right here. Over the last century the United States has endured two wars, a great depression, numerous recessions, oil shocks and the like, yet the Dow rose from 66 to 18,000. It’s probably safe to say that it’ll keep climbing in the long run.

So, like Warren Buffett once said:
… If you aren’t willing to own a stock for ten years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes. Put together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward over the years, and so also will the portfolio’s market value.

This connects back to the aforementioned idea of a ‘wonderful’ company. Invest in what you believe in, and wait it out. It might even be best to not check on your investments every day. Getting a low evaluation might discourage you and force you to sell your stock at the worst possible time. Always look at the big picture.

To wrap it up – educate yourself, and know what you’re getting into. Follow Buffett’s simple words of advice, and be patient with your investments. After all, “it is not necessary to do extraordinary things to get extraordinary results.”

A rate raise will hardly be a surprise given recent statements. Plus if you look at the forecasts by the [Fed from Sept](http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20150917.htm) of the 13 of the 17 members said the rate raise should come before the end of 2015.

**But what will Fed rates go to? How will the market react?**

Back to the Fed forecasts from Sept:

* 1 member said -0.125% would be the rate at the end of Dec 2015
* 3 members said 0.125%
* 7 members said 0.375%
* 5 members said 0.625%
* 1 member said 0.875%

Average is 0.40%

This is the forecast of the average, given the Fed uses a range. Currently it's 0.00-0.25% (midpoint 0.125%).

A 0.25% hike looks like it's on the cards, if the 0.375% is what the Fed goes for?

I am wondering if every loan you have is viewed as negative cash and every positive cash balance is viewed as positive cash.  Are you net positive or net negative?

like is your mortgage and car loans and student loans more than your cash amount?  

so if you have 10k in savings and hold 10k in your investment accoutn as cash, but have a 200k mortgage.  then your negative 180k cash.  and if your house is worth 400k and your stocks are 325k, -180/(725)= -24% cash.

15-12-09,An Update on $NEOT,"Link to original DD: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3vgdlh/neot_dd/)

Recently (Monday) NEOT announced that it obtained another patent on the technology it uses for it's drug LIPO-202; this went unnoticed as the market has taken a dump recently. Along with this good news of this patent, it not only boosts investor confidence but they additionally released for that [they are planning on releasing data on Top-Line (final) data Mid-December](http://investors.neothetics.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=253672&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2119082). This is great news.

NEOT is currently cheap with these dips with the market. Investor confidence might be down because of other reasons, as NEOT has not made any other PR's besides the patent - which to me was positive. 

So along with my old DD, it seems that NEOT is still a good recommendation. I set a conservative price target in the 9.50-10.50 range on good results. 

They will most likely be releasing results next week. My guess is sometime between Thursday-Monday as the rate hike stuff is going down Tuesday and Wednesday. Pray for a pop and get in while it's cheap.",7

15-12-10,Picking quality financial stocks,"I'm trying to round out my portfolio and now seems like a decent time to add to start adding to a position in financial companies. I'd like either an insurance company with a killer manager investing its float (a la BRK or Markel), or probably a bank stock. In essence I'm leaning away from investment banks and similar institutions since I have a little bit of exposure there already. Any recommendations with a brief explanation would be very appreciated. 

My other question is when picking bank stocks, is it better to pick a lower efficiency company that's improving its efficiency, or is it better to pick a company that's already efficient? I like Wells Fargo a lot because of their conservative lending that lets gives them high quality assets, as well as their efficient operations. However, I can't see them doubling or tripling in size the way a smaller bank could. But smaller banks are less efficient, hence my question. ",4

I signed up a while back, and just today updated it with my student email address.  But before I put more into it, anyone else using it?  Thoughts?  Does it offer good portfolios for the different investment types (conservative - aggressive)?

It has a round-up service to automate investing in the portfolio you choose.  So if you spend $1.50, they invest the difference of the rounded-up amount ($0.50).  Once the round-ups reach $5 or another amount you set, it withdraws it from your account and invests it in your portfolio.  

You can use their app for Android, Apple, Windows, or their website to manage your account.  You can link a funding account as well as accounts they track for round-ups.  I might give it a shot since I don't have to pay the monthly $1, as a perk for being a student.  Like Robinhood, but I can invest my change rather than paying full share prices.

15-12-10,What to expect after a merger?,"Hey everyone,

Those of you who follow tech stocks might have heard that NXP and Freescale closed a merger on Monday. I purchased Freescale stock when the deal was first announced at the start of the year hoping to get a guaranteed payout with cash portion of the merger. The specifics were that every one share of FSL would be paid with $6.25 in cash and .35 shares of NXPI.

Since the merger was finalized, Freescale's stock disappeared from the market as I expected, but my money seems to have gone along for the ride. I use E-Trade and my portfolio still shows holdings in FSL (Freescale's old ticker). Since FSL no longer exists, I can't sell the shares to recover that money and I'm more than a little confused. I assumed the cash and NXPI shares would be awarded immediately after FSL was removed and am starting to get worried. I emailed E-Trade yesterday but have received no response, so I will be calling tomorrow.

Am I being impatient and ought to give E-Trade time to adjust my account, or have I made a huge mistake in interpreting the merger details and lost a sizable chunk of my money? As a bonus question, how do you feel about trading companies that are slated to be acquired? Does it tend to pay off in the long run or is it better to focus on the company doing the acquiring?",0

So I posted this on the Forex trading subreddit yesterday: https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/3vzej2/am_i_crazy_or_is_the_euro_about_to_pop_like_a/

Basically, I noticed the EUR/USD spot starting to consolidate and hit 1.09 about four or five times, forming a fucking beautiful ascending triangle.  I'm not usually one to go for patterns, but this thing was hitting 1.09 and bouncing off for like two days.  Anyway, I used a too-tight stoploss and sold on the VERY LAST DIP at 1.0883.  It then proceeded to shoot to 1.*1042* overnight.  And I stopped out.

Seriously, I often bring this up at work about how the third party tools we have work 10000000x better than the things we developed for internal use.  Well worth the money. Products: 10/10.

2) The markup on their macros are fucking insane.  Seriously.  The licensing fees to add a calendar macro I requested at work are fucking stupid.  A calendar, simple enough function, would run my company 10,000.  I believe the prices are based on company size, and I work for a medium sized business.  I can't imagine the stacks TEAM pulls in on selling this shit to bigger companies. Revenue model 10/10.

3) Their earnings were so so, but still positive.  Perhaps the single  biggest thing that stands out to me is their consistency.  These mother fuckers have been profitable for 10 consecutive years.  Think about that fucking shit.  When was the recession?  Oh yeah, during that fucking time frame. Earnings 3/10, Stability 10/10.

4) This is not a get rich quick.  This is a buy and hold.  One one hand, there are not that many companies doing exactly what they do that are publicly traded.  If there are, they do other things as well, so tough to compare.  On the other hand, their support is top notch, their quality is top notch, their products ease of use is good, management is solid, and they could easily grow on an IPO.  I told my coworker about their IPO and he had no idea who they were.  I named off their products and he was like oh shit, I want to get in on that.  While we are just two shmucks that use their shit, I like to buy stocks occasionally in companies I actually like/believe in.  If altassian becomes a household name, the moon is a possibility.


Overall fuckall out of 10 because no one will buy this since its not yolo enough.  But I will probably sink a chunk of my long money in this because reasons.  Feel free to add more DD.  Or try to talk me out of dumping 30% of my long hold money on this shit, because I have had some drinks.

15-12-10,Question about end of year mutual fund investing and taxes on dividends/distributions,"I add $5K-$10K to VTSAX (Vanguard Total Stock Market Index) every 3rd month of the quarter (commissions from previous qtr).  With December distributions coming up, should I wait to invest this month's $8K until after the distribution or Jan. 1 to avoid taxes on the distribution associated with the $8K?  Or do I risk missing out on gains?  I currently have $120K in VTSAX in a brokerage (taxable) account with dividends reinvested.    Thank you.  

http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=715686
  
From the article:  
""Don't: 'Buy the distribution.' 
It's debatable whether you should do anything if a fund you own is about to make a distribution (more on this below). But one thing is for sure: If you're considering adding a fund to your portfolio--or heavily bulking up an existing position--and a fund is forecasting a large capital gains distribution, consider holding off on your new purchase until the distribution has already occurred. Otherwise, you'll be paying taxes on gains that you weren't on board to enjoy."" ",3

15-12-10,Loss of cost basis when shares convert post bankruptcy?,"Bit of a specific question, but I could use some help. I owned a decent amount of shares in a company (let's call it ticker ABC) which had a very poor performance and filed for bankruptcy approval. Part of the bankruptcy plan was for creditors to forego all debt, and they would then own something like 97% of the equity, with 3% of the equity being distributed to the previous shareholders. Obviously pretty close to a full wipe-out, but since it was a loss either way, I figured I would let the shares go into bankruptcy and convert, knowing I had a tax-loss basis either way.
I was just checking the ""cost basis"" on these ABC-New shares in my brokerage account, and they show a cost basis of $0 - while I had spent $X,XXX for the original shares. I had expected that cost basis to carry over - did I just lose that? Will it be automatically reported on the tax statements I receive from my brokerage for the original equity and I just don't see it now?
Any insight or even where to look would be very helpful - thanks.",0

15-12-11,$BBRY Play,"$BBRY gained 7% today over news that the Priv apparently ""sold out"" on $WMT online. They list on $WMT 1 day prior - so supposedly, this represents phenomenal sales. 

I'm not buying the bullshit though. The Priv was launched in mid-Nov with a sub-stellar start and okay reviews. It benchmarks comparably to competitors. Its network support is shit (only $T in the US and likewise in international markets - several carriers aren't supporting) - which limits sales. Even unlocked (direct from $BBRY or somewhere like $WMT) you're looking at only using the phone on like $T or $TMUS, so potential buyers are limited by design. And...they didn't even sell-out the pre-order this time.

Given the numerous issues they've faced in fulfilling orders early on due to distribution problems **selling on their own damn website**, my gut feeling is that ""unavailable"" on $WMT is an indication of a distribution failure based on poor supply preparation - perhaps also by design - (I imagine they used metrics from Passport sales and their preorder figures - and I've also seen data on poor logistics on the Priv) or $WMT (and certain others) phasing them out due to **lackluster sales** and not stellar sales. If this garbage was actually doing well, and sold out online because of it, at the very least we'd be able to find the phone on store shelves.

**FACT: If Priv was selling like hotcakes, COO Marty SmegmaBeard wouldn't be alluding to it - they'd be dropping PR. We'd be able to validate sales through analyticz on multiple platforms (all signs point down). EtC.**

Even if sales were good in relative terms, they still have shit market share. Not only that, the Priv buyers will be mostly Crackberry crackheads. They're eating into their own sales - they're not gaining market share. This is confirmed in small surveys as well.

They arn't going to report *actual* figures until the 24th - so its speculation in all directions. The problem is, the bullish speculation for $BBRY hardware (~40% of business) is a pipe dream.

15-12-11,Tax loss harvesting and year end dividends,"Hi /r/Investing friends,

I'm trying to understand how the dividend works alongside tax loss harvesting for my [Vanguard Emerging Markets ETF](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0964&amp;FundIntExt=INT) ($VWO). I've experienced over a 10% loss by the end of the year, so my goal is to sell it and immediately buy [iShares Emerging Markets ETF](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239637/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-etf) ($EEM) since each of them are based on different emerging market indexes (FTSE vs MSCI) so they should not trigger a wash sale.

Anyways, I'm looking at the payment date of the year end dividend for Vanguard's EM index: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/vwo/dividend-history

It says the dividend will be paid out on the 28th of December, and that the market will remain open for the remainder of the year ([Dec 29-31](http://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=calendar)) so basically my goal is to get the dividend on the 28th and move everything over to the iShares EM index ($EEM) as soon as possible.

Does this make sense, and everything seems in order? Trying to recoup quite a bit in capital losses while not screwing up the sizeable dividend of Vanguard's fund.",1

15-12-10,How companies massage their profits to beat market forecasts,"ALMOST every results season, the markets go through an elaborate ritual, as stylised as Kabuki theatre. The profit forecasts made by analysts, highly optimistic in advance, are reduced. Companies then beat those forecasts by a small margin. Analysts then declare the result season a ""success"" even though the reported profits are lower than the forecasts they made 6 or 12 months earlier.

This happens at the aggregate level but reflects another pattern at the level of the individual company. Executives have every incentive to match or beat forecasts as the market punishes those that fail to do so. That, in turn, hurts the value of the share options which are the best hope of making the executives rich.

A recent academic paper looks in detail at this process (The Valuation Premium for a String of Positive Earnings Surprises: The Role of Earnings Manipulation by Jenny Chu, Patricia Dechow, Kai Wai Hui and Annika Yu Wang). As the authors point out, it is hard to know whether the ability of the corporate sector to beat forecasts is due to good management, a growing economy or outright manipulation. So they focus on companies that the SEC has identified as indulging in manipulation.

Sure enough they find that 53% of such firms have a record of four straight quarters of beating forecasts, compared with just 43% of all firms. Secondly, they find that firms tend to indulge in earnings manipulation when they already have a high stock market multiple; they are trying to prop up their share price, not inflate it. The average price-earnings ratio during the manipulation period is 35.

Third, they find that 42% of manipulating firms beat profits for eight quarters, compared with 32% of all firms. After that, the difference is not statistically significant. So two years seems to be the limit for cooking the books. And fourth, they find that executives focus more on beating forecasts than on beating last year's numbers.

Perhaps this is not surprising; everyone knows this stuff goes on, but they don't know which companies are at it. But it all makes me suspicious of the argument that reported profits are more ""accurate"" than they were in the past and that therefore the market deserves a higher valuation.

15-12-11,Are we crazy to buy VAB Bonds?,"Edit: Note that VAB is a Canadian Bond ETF

We know interest rates cannot decrease much more (Bank of Canada is likely going to decrease rates and looking at negative rates as an option), from this point they can only rise.


Average dividends from VAB is 3.4% [1] and capital gains are likely to decrease over the next 5-10 years due to interest rates being historically low. 

If the discount rate (today’s interest rate) is higher than the coupon rate (3.4%) the present value will be less than par and you’re buying at a discount. If the discount rate is lower than the coupon rate, the present value will be higher than par value and your buying at a premium. [2]



Why are we diversifying with bonds bought at a premium that are only going to lose value instead of GICs or holding cash?


The conventional wisdom is that bonds are inversely correlated with stocks, this assumes that when stocks decline that bonds will decline because interest rates will drop. But what happens when stocks decline and interest rates don’t have room to drop, or worse, they rise?  


Isn’t it intuitive that we should be putting our “bond” money in a high interest savings account or GICs instead until interest rates become higher than the coupon rate?

Fitzgerald gets 3% commission from this. It is explicitly stated that Fitzgerald can cancel this agreement anytime on the foundation that they believe Neot's foundations and/or financials have changed drastically. Why would NEOT agree to that clause specifically if they do not believe in good trial results? If they had just signed this then released poor results, they'd be out of Fitz. ",5

This stock isn't closely followed by many analysts, but those who do are bullish. GATX ($GMT) has consistently increased it's dividend, and is on track to increase it Q1 2016.

Under the terms of the deal, shareholders of Dow Chemical  will get 1 share in the new company called DowDuPont for each Dow share, while DuPont shareholders will get 1.282 shares for each DuPont share. The deal’s structure will give Dow and DuPont shareholders equal stakes in the combined company.

I posted this to /r/personalfinance but that sub seems a little over saturated with threads. I'm hoping I can get some advice from you guys :)

I'm a student, and I occasionally do freelance web projects. I also drive for Uber, and sometimes work as a 1099 at my father's office. Some weeks I make ~$250, some weeks I make nothing. 

I live at home and have most of my expenses paid for while I am attending college. I would like to get into investing as a hobby, and also as a means of ""hiding"" money from myself, so I can stash away my disposable income and slowly build a portfolio rather than blowing it on junk.

I have an interest in stocks and mutual funds, but my issue is that every transaction has a 5-10 dollar fee. My goal is to put away small amounts ($20-$100) a couple times a month to eventually grow a nice little nest egg for the future. However, if I'm getting $8 fees on any transaction, putting $50 in a stock seems like a complete waste. What are my options?

The obvious answer would be to put it in a savings account, but I would rather have something more fun with the potential to grow.",1

Previous day - ended up with loss of 107

My saving grace was the spy straddle 206.50 /207.50 put call. Bought on the assumption that today's news economic news on retail and consumer sentiment would have some effect. Maybe compound that with next weeks news as well going into the weekend.

Anyway, I lucked out and managed to close out ALL positions for profit. 

For future trades that may work with the SPY this is the recipe I followed

1) Straddle slightly OTM within 0.50 of trade price
2) from now on, 2 days before event 
3) going into weekend may affect it, IF there is news coming up the following week.
4) expected move for profit 1% in either direction. 

For next week's trade, I think if you can get another straddle around the closing price of w.e today ends up (203-204.5) range, I think it might do well with he upcoming interest rates talk next week.

15-12-12,Daily advice thread. All questions about your personal situation should be asked here,"If your question is ""I have $10,000, what do I do?"" or anything similar. There is no single answer to this question, but we will also need A LOT MORE information if we are to give some sort of answer

* How old are you?
* Are you employed/making income? How much?
* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?
* Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

&gt;That’s not to say that investors should just yank their money out of high-yield mutual funds, which could both exacerbate their losses and possibly rob them of any recovery.

15-12-12,Help! Investment gone bad,"Hello, thank you for reading this message. I have been researching this and I can't get a handle on what the outcome will be.

It all started a few months ago when a 'friend' wanted to invest in a project I was working on. He registered a Subchapter S and gave me the minority portion. He got a banking account for the company and deposited money. Now, I thought this was all normal. There wasn't any expenses and nor would there be for quite some time. I thought he was getting everything ready for when I would be finished (expected to be May of next year).

I own 49%, he attempted to have me sign a note saying I owe him 49% of the money he invested. I freaked out and checked the account: he has spent a large portion of it on some pretty ludicrous things of which none of it had anything to do with the business we were due to open half a year from now. He is now claiming he can take me to court for the 49% even if I don't sign the paper.

I am completely freaked out. This person was a good friend of mine growing up so I mistakingly trusted him. That alone has me pretty up set. I don't believe there is any way possible what he is claiming will actually go through the court system. I never agreed to pay this money back nor did it have anything to do with my business. I was being scammed from day one.

I just want to know, I am completely alright, right??? What type of lawyer should I get? What do I need to do to protect myself?",7

If the fed does anything at all unexpected, if any global event (terrorism, etc.) happens in the next week, if there's any further negative choice by oil decision makers to push prices lower, given the confluence of factors and options expiration the market could absolutely collapse.

If you know how to trade around this, trade volatility, etc., great.  If instead you're, for example, using Robinhood to YOLO biotechs and whatever else you hear a rumor on - think about getting out on anything you're up or neutral on.

Maybe you'll miss out on some gains, but this is not normal YOLOing time.  This is professional big boy trading time where nothing anyone has diligenced and no normal market factors are going to drive any of your results.

15-12-11,"Thoughts on Fantasy Aces (FASDF or FAS.V) after today's news?","Hey everyone,

Fantasy Aces is a daily fantasy sports competition website that is publicly traded. Upon reviewing their financial releases and reading their PR's I'm inclined to believe that they are a good long term buy. The stock dropped from around 10 cents a share to 3-4 cent range following news that the New York state Attorney General would try to ban the industry, and today the stock dropped back to the 3 cent range upon a state supreme judge granting an injunction against the two largest players in the industry (Draft Kings and Fan Duel). Despite the injunction, which causes the two largest players to temporarily cease operations until further ruling on the legality of the industry, I believe that this industry is here to stay as regulatory legislation will be decided upon on a state by state basis. My largest worry is that a negative outcome in New York will set a precedent in other states; but I still believe that there will be a large enough market both nationally and internationally for the industry to be profitable. As it stands today, the injunction does not impact operations of other fantasy sites such as Fantasy Aces, who is one of the top 5 companies operating in the industry.

A Lilly spokeswoman said Friday that the price for Portrazza, which received marketing approval from U.S. regulators in November, is similar to other biotechnology drugs. She said Portrazza extended survival among patients with a deadly type of cancer known as squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has had few new treatment options in recent years.

But cancer experts describe the survival gain as modest. Portrazza, known generically as necitumumab, extended median patient life by six to seven weeks in a clinical trial versus chemotherapy, to about 11 1/2 months from the start of treatment. Half of patients who received Portrazza lived longer and half lived less.

15-12-11,Ultra-Aggressive Mutual Fund Portfolio?,"I've been reading a little about 2/3/4 fund mutual fund portfolios. I want to invest in Vanguard mutual funds. Vanguard suggests an aggressive allocation would be 60% in VTSMX and 40% in VGTSX. Is this really the most aggressive way to invest in mutual funds or is there another allocation where you don't give a fuck about risk and it's all about returns?

Another question: VGTSX is listed at Vanguard as a mutual fund that has potential for higher risk and higher return than VTSMX. Although whenever I look at foreign stock funds, it seems like throughout history, they under-perform domestic stocks. Is there any legitimate reason why foreign stock funds have a higher potential for returns?

15-12-12,My first DD- ZEN (TSX),"So I noticed that Goldman Sachs (GS) set a price target for Zenyatta Ventures of $33.00 CDN. 
http://imgur.com/3vFY4mP

I looked into this company, it has a beta ratio of 1.15, so its pretty volatile. Their total assets currently is around 21 million with about 2-3 million in liabilities which they have been reducing since 2011. Its current market cap is at 52.8 million. GS has hopes that ZEN will be able to reach $33/share (1.8 billion market cap). 

So why are they being valued so high? Zenyatta is a mining company based in Ontario. They mainly focus on graphite which is used in fuel cells. They currently have the largest graphite deposit in the Northern Ontario. It is also the largest high purity deposit being developed in the world. They won't have to process it as much using heat treatment/acids etc because of its initial quality. This most likely means they will have a higher profit margin.

They are currently partnered with Ballard Power Systems, who make fuel cells for buses, trains, backup power etc. Their (Ballard) revenue for the last quarter was 71.7 million. Ballard is  also a leader in the use of proton exchange membranes in their fuel cells. This makes fuel cells, smaller, lighter and also provides higher performance (According to Ballard). 

Ballard is currently prototyping the use of ZEN's graphite in their fuel cells. They are measuring the natural graphite's performance by using synthetic graphite as a benchmark. The fuel cells made from ZEN's graphite has identical performance when compared to synthetic graphite (Source - http://www.zenyatta.ca/article/press-release-1404.asp)

 Using natural formed graphite will be a huge advantage to them because synthetic sells for $20000/tonne vs natural which is $6000 - $10000/tonne. (Source - http://www.canadacarbon.com/synthetic-vs-natural-graphite)

Naturally formed graphite also has a higher crystalline structure, making it more conductive thermally, and electrically making it ideal for use in fuel cells. So in theory, the market for graphite is expanding because of the switch many automotive manufacturers are making to electric vehicles/hybrids. People are also using fuel cells to power their homes (Tesla Powerwall).

Whether or not ZEN becomes huge depends entirely on Ballard at the moment. If they choose to use ZEN's graphite it will mean a lot of revenue for the company. However there is no timeline as to when this will be, so this a company that will most likely have a positive future, but the future still carries a risk.

So the story goes like this:

Some anonymous short seller posted an article that the company, United Development Funding which is a Texas-based real estate investment agency, was a big ponzi scheme. Of course the market overreacted causing the thing to tumble beginning Thursday and continuing until Friday where it bounced back from its new low of $7 to $8.60 at close. 

Meanwhile the UDF said some hedge fund made a huge short position just the day before that and the anonymous short seller was likely connected to said hedge fund. 

As a result, that fucker is obviously undersold. I mean look at the chart: https://i.imgur.com/LOAHAEl.png


Should be bouncing back from $8.60 to at least $10 if not all the way back to the $15 range. I don't see why it shouldn't.

Shortseller's claim:
--
United Development Funding IV's SEC filings reveal only 71 percent of its year-to-date distributions in 2015 came from cash from operations. The remaining 29 percent of the distributions paid were financed by credit facilities, indicating that a large portion of UDF’s 2015 distributions to shareholders were funded with borrowed money.

The short-seller claims that different UDF REITs – UDF I, UDF II, etc. – make loans against properties previously financed by other UDF entities. According to reports, a development known as Shahan Prairie was financed first by UDF I, then received financing from UDF III, slowly increasing the loan balance through the financial crisis. In 2015, UDF V issued a larger loan to the same project, with the proceeds used to repay UDF III.

Company statement: http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/8/summary/?id=2262471
--
United Development Funding III and United Development Funding IV (the “Companies”) are aware that a hedge fund has created a significant short position in United Development Funding IV shares (UDF).  We believe that this hedge fund is trying to unlawfully profit by manipulating and depressing the price of United Development Funding IV shares.

The Companies have been cooperating since April 2014 with a nonpublic fact-finding investigation being conducted by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).  The SEC has informed the Companies that this investigation is not an indication that any violations of law have occurred or that the SEC has any negative opinion of any person, entity, or security.  We believe that the Companies have appropriate policies and procedures in place to ensure accurate financial reporting and compliance with all applicable rules and regulations.  While it is not possible to predict the timing or outcome of the SEC fact-finding investigation, we believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the Companies’ consolidated results of operation, financial position, or liquidity.

You be the judge of this yolo. My personal opinion. Yeah, the SEC investigation is still ongoing. But once the SEC leaves, this should really have a healthy bounce back and everyone who bought this at $7-8 will go away with a fat profit.",7
15-12-13,Is a leveraged index really such a bad idea?,"I've been digging into past data and exploring the option of leveraged indexes as an investment strategy.  I know that's a hot topic around here, but bear with me.  I'm looking for discussion/corrections/improvements.

[Excel File download](http://www.filedropper.com/leveragestrategycomparison1_1) (Warning, 15,000+ line file)

[Results](http://imgur.com/kSkFdaa)

**PROCESS:**

What I did was take the daily returns from the S&amp;P 500 for the last 65 years (from Yahoo Finance), then created a ""leveraged"" version of that (3x volatility).  I converted that data into a rolling annual return for each day, looking back 252 days (creating about 64 years of data).  Essentially, I created a 252 day Simple Moving Average line, both for the S&amp;P 500 and for the 3x leveraged version.  Next I subtracted 2.5% from each return (to simulate inflation) and 0.95% from only the 3x returns (to simulate higher expenses for leveraged ETFs).  Finally I took those ~16,000 data points , and did some math with them (shown in the Results table) and compared them.  

I also included a double-negative example to weight the negative return years of the 3x leverage fund by double.  This was strictly for comparison purposes and not for practical investment use.

***edit note:*** Beyond what has been gone over in the comments, I think there may be a problem here.  I averaged the 1y returns, but that only gives me an estimated 1y return.  To extrapolate it to 15+ years, I can't average it together, because then long-term decay is ignored.  We get the same +25%, -25% = 0% instead of -6.25% error that is common with the ""leverage decay"" argument.  I'll need to make some more spreadsheets to test larger ranges beyond 1y to account for that decay.

**ASSUMPTIONS/DATA COLLECTION:**

* Inflation Rate: 2.5%/year

* Expenses for Leverage: 0.95%/year

* One year: 252 trading days

* Two key date ranges:

 * Start date, broken up by approximately 20 year increments

 * End date, both today (high point) and 2009 (local low point).

* Four key results:

 * Return - the average annual return for the investment

 * Expected Low - The lowest expected annual return experienced by the fund, based on a 98% confidence interval.  If this exceeds -100%, the fund is determined to have a high potential for bankruptcy.

 * Sharpe Ratio - Risk-adjusted returns for comparison

 * Sortino Ratio - Risk-adjusted returns, excluding upside volatility as a benefit.

**DISCUSSION:**

What I'm seeing here, assuming the data and math is correct, is that inflation-adjusted returns show the 3x leverage to be about 17-23% more effective (Sharpe) or 70-75% more effective (Sortino) than the equivalent 1x leverage, at least with regards to the historical S&amp;P 500 returns.  The volatility is higher and you experience much higher and lower swings, but even so (if you flip over to Sheet 2 of the excel, unformatted) it appears that the waiting period for a ""guaranteed"" return is only 13-15 years, which is actually quite similar to the S&amp;P 500's results.  This is more than enough time for a retirement account, and in fact would almost guarantee early retirement after 20 years (19.3% AAR!)  Volatility decay is overcome, expense ratios are overcome, and the downsides of leverage seem non-existent here.

I would go so far as to say the only real risk, given that you have enough time to leave your funds untouched, is a single bad day with a 34% or greater loss bankrupting the fund.  Historically this does not appear to be a risk of note, with the lowest one-day return from this data set showing a 20.47% loss.

So, can someone tell me why we're not all buying 3x leveraged indexes for our retirement?  I have to imagine I'm missing or miscalculating something here, I don't claim to be smarter than the professionals with degrees in accounting and economics.  *So what the hell am I doing wrong* that has me ""beating the market"" consistently?",34

The market started doing what I expected which was exhibit some fear selling as we get closer to the hike. So much so it dropped 12 points in 1 min. That's a huge move down... but it was abruptly stopped by what can only be described as panic buying and in the next instance smashed upward 14 points in 1 min... 14 fucking points in 1 min!!... The sell off continue as the panic buyer absorbed all the fear selling and managed to prevent a crash enough that the over all change wasn't to large to spook the market. In any case its apparent that a large mystery buyer is coming with either the intention to prevent a crash or the expectation that market is going pop upward on the rate hike and my guess is both. When that much money moves in one direction im going to play it safe and get out of the way. Sure it may go down and I would have other wise expected it to but this changes everything. I will be closing my SPXU by the end of the day. Good luck...

Edit: Closed out SPXU at 2010 and shortly after the market went vertical for the last 45 min of trading. Hope you're not short tomorrow.",0

15-12-13,Crisis prevention,"Hey guys, I'm hoping to encourage some discussion with this post. 
It's going to be a long read, so hold tight. I would love some insight if possible.

I am taking a grad level course in securities regulation. Essentially, we discuss the legal aspects behind financial scandals and what provisions are in place to hold certain actors liable. More specifically, we went through the entire registration phase, exemptions from registrations (Rule 506 etc.), IPO's, and subsequent insider information as well as information leakages. In the second half of the course we covered financial scandals and their respective responses. For instance, upon discussing Enron, we went through SOX in some detail. 

Here is where I need your help, /r/investing. We have a final exam coming up which is open book, open note, open everything. The exam is one paragraph which describes an ongoing financial crisis in very limited detail. We are supposed to present ideas as to (1) how the financial crisis came to be, (2) what the likely responses were (for instance, aiding &amp; abetting liability for secondary actors not directly involved in defrauding the client is very limited in the US), and (3) given the responses, how can we prevent from future crises and how can we recover from them more effectively?


I want to come into this exam with multiple suggestions up my sleeve. Unfortunately, I have only one in mind:

(1) Dodd Frank established the Orderly Liquidation Fund. Put short, systemically important financial institutions (if they fail, the chance for a crisis increases dramatically) receive bailout money from the OLF, which borrows from the treasury, and pay back the money in future assessments. There are multiple downsides: (1) in theory, the OLF allows companies in need of a bailout to borrow from tax payers (the treasury) indirectly. As taxpayers have suffered heavily during the crisis, we must limit tax revenue being used as bailout money. (2) The OLF requires that *surviving* SIFI's pay back the bailout money; this statement in of itself suggests a serious issue. As SIFI's sustain very symbiotic relationships with one another, a failed SIFI does not mean less competition and greater revenue for survivors - quite the contrary, really. As such, to expect surviving SIFI's to carry not only their own OLF liability, but also a portion of their failed counterparts' is absurd. My suggestion (which I picked up in readings) would be to focus on avoiding taxpayer money at all costs. Instead, SIFI's must provide periodic cash payments as a function of their risk level and the total bailouts provided in the previous crisis. The cash payments are stored in a fund which, ultimately, serves as bailout insurance. The benefits of this plan are also such that a system of self-paternalism is established: if the SIFI's do not contribute to this insurance, they will run the risk of receiving absolutely no bailout money in the event of a crisis. Furthermore, it is an ""all of us or none of us"" situation in that if a handful decide not to participate, those who are participating will be incentivised to encourage their counterparts for the greater good.  

What do you guys think? 

I would love to hear some of your recommendations. You don't need to even go into much detail - I'd prefer to research the topics on my own. I just need some inspiration and, hopefully, we can have an extensive discussion in this thread!",4

15-12-13,Legit science approach,"tl;dr
It felt like I was in a home electronics store being hassled by a salesman when I read two books on investing and I’m looking for a more unbiased and scientific yet simple guide. Any help out there?

Hi,
I'm an engineering/natural science student who recently has become very interested in investing, especially when it comes to stocks. It's the money making that motivates me(since I'm short on $ anyway) but the joy of learning. My entire life, I have been learning a ridiculous amount of things but none of them being the science of money or how to use them.

Anyway I started out by googling(surprise) and found a lot of recommendations on books. Some where easier to find than others, some seemed more legit than others but I finally decided to read ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" by By Robert T. Kiyosaki.  Kiyosaki, a salesman and an education pro, tells us about his life with two dads; one poor and one rich, and makes grand comparisons. I found his story truly amazing but couldn't help the extreme mistrust that arose in me after I read his passage on the history of taxes, where he told a(I believe a very false and biased one) story of how taxes are something that arose in more or less modern times in a robin hood manner of fashion. In the end it always felt like the author was trying to sell me one of his workshops and not trying to teach me how to invest.

Kiyosaki's book really opened my eyes to another reality, the one of making your money work for you. But I still didn't know how so I went ahead and googled again and this time I chose “Learn to Earn” by Peter Lynch and John Rothchild. This one had a very different touch compared to “""Rich Dad, Poor Dad” in mostly telling the tales of corporate history. A lot of practical advice and warnings are handed out but I can’t help feeling a bit too careful about accepting what the authors were telling me. A lot of it felt like it was the authors’ guts that were doing the thinking and not really caring whether the stuff they told could be backed up by references or not.

So the thing is I like the whole concept of making good stock investments and I am eager to learn more about it. But like most people I don’t like feeling like I am being manipulated and would rather have a credible, somewhat scientific source of information. Has anybody else felt the same? I know two books don’t count as good statistics but It feels kind of dark already. Are there any legit introductions to investing in stocks out there? ",5

15-12-14,Fingerprint Cards (STO: FING-B),"I thought I’d write a short intro to a very exciting Swedish company called Fingerprint Cards (STO: FING-B, hereafter FPC). I bet a lot of people here have heard about them (and indeed maybe own shares). Some will probably know it a lot better than I do, but this is a start. Even though it’s a small company (market cap of slightly more than $3.5 billion), it’s one of the most traded stocks in Europe. I’m from Norway, and the FPC has a higher trade volume on an average day than the entire stock exchange in Norway.

So, what do they do? They make fingerprint scanners for smartphones, tablets and soon to be smartcards.

**Reasons for reading on:**  

- It’s the fastest growing company in Europe (words of the CEO a couple of days ago).  
- I mean it’s still a good buy even though it’s up 1300% so far this year.  
- They have a highly scalable business model.  
- They have, seemingly, the best technology.  

**History and competition**  
18 years ago there were a couple of players in the fingerprint business. You had the Americans Authentec and Synaptics and FPC. A few more players have entered the scene later on. Chinese Goodix is the most notable of them now, as well as a couple of Norwegian companies (Idex and Next Biometrics). Nothing really happened before Authentec was bought by Apple and released the Iphone 5s with touch id. Suddenly everyone wanted a fingerprint scanner on their phone. The breakthrough for FPC was when Huawei launched their Mate 7 in 2014 with a sensor from FPC. So what about Synaptics? They deliver the sensors for all Samsung-phones.

**Financials**  
Revenue (in SEK (divide by 8,5 to get USD)):
2012: 12 million  
2013: 94 million  
2014: 233 million  
2015: 2.8 billion (estimated)  
2016: 7.5 billion (middle range of guided 6.5-8.5 last week).  
2017: ?  

They say their gross margin will be roughly the same as the second half of 2015 which has been 45%(!). With 22% tax, 550m in Opex (roughly) we’re looking at a positive cash flow of over 2 billion sek next year. If the middle range of the guided will come through. This year though, they have increased their guiding 4 or 5 times because of the explosive market. I think they are careful for 2016. A guiding of 6.5 billion leaves almost no market growth (q over q) as Q4 2015 will have a revenue of about 1.3billion alone and Q1 should be around 1.4-1.5 billion.

**Customers**  
FPC stated that their goal was to have 50% of the addressable market of fingerprint sensor market for smartphones in 2014. In practice they probably have 85-90%. They are sweeping the floor with the competition.

9 out of the 10 biggest smartphone players in China are customers of FPC. 42 phones have launched in China with FPC to date. Huawei, Lenovo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Oppo, Coolpad, Vivo, Gionee, Meizu and a lot of smaller all have phones with FPC technology.

The biggest market is still outside of China for FPC. Obviously Huawei (who really are all in and 100m phone sales in 2016 should net FPC 2.4 billion in revenue alone) is the biggest. Google is the

In 2015 53 smarthphones/tablets with FPC have been launched with 24 OEMs. 2 phones were launched in 2014.

**Brands outside of China:**  
LG
Sony
Google (the new Nexus phones by LG and Huawei). Google also included FPC in the work with Android M.
Microsoft (Surface 4 pro)
Blu
Nextbit Robin (Kickstarter project)

**The competition and their phones:**  
Synaptics: They have Samsung, and are struggling. Some think that Samsung will come to FPC. That would be HUGE. They also have Sharp.
Apple: Only inhouse
Next Biometrics: No phones to date
Idex: No phones to date
Goodix: They won TCL (top 10 in China, but probably can’t sell it outside of China because of patent issues). Goodix previously had Meizu which FPC now has.

A lot of smaller niche phones have been released as well with unknown sensor producer.

**Growing market**  
The fingerprint sensor penetration (the number of phones with a sensor that is released of the total amount) is slightly above 30% for 2015. About 100m sensors this yearFPC says that 2016 the number will be a bit more than 50% (about 300m will be FPCs share probably). This will continue to increase until 100% of the phones are released with a sensor (2020ish).

**New business opportunities**  
Smartcards is coming soon to try to stop the bleeding of customers from credit cards to smartphone payment systems. It’s in development and starting commercialization in 2016. In 2018 the smartcard market, according to FPC, will be as big as the smartphone market in 2016 (7,5 billion more for FPC?). Who has the technology for smartcards? So far, only FPC who is leading this together with Zwipe and Mastercard plus some unknown fintech companies.

Check out Kickstarter and see how many new projects feature fingerprint sensors. They are coming everywhere. Smart locks for bikes. Smart homes. Internet of things. Medical equipment. Guns. Passports. Automotive industry. This is just the beginning of this mega trend.

**The Stock**  
The stock is a WILD ride. From the low of 30ish this year it’s at 494 now. However, 7 trading days ago it closed at 675 before the guiding of 2016. Since it has dropped like a stone, was down to 421 today. 

Now, what is a fair valuation of a company that grows 1000% from 2014 to 2015 and looking at 200% 2015-2016? Current valuation gives a forward P/E of around 10 if they hit the top of the guiding. I personally believe they will top their guided range. Based on 2015 numbers they are trading at a P/E of 37,5 (but bear in mind that the revenue for Q1-Q3 have been 140m - 460m - 960m and Q4 is looking at 1300m). With rolling four quarters like Q4

**Outlook:**  
5% of the stock (about 3 million shares) is shorted which also has caused the downfall last week. They might have to close the short prior to 21st of December (FPC enters Eurostoxx 600 index) or 4th of January (enters the OMX30 index). A few million shares will be bought by index funds of the total of 64 million shares.

**Technology**  
I advice to take a look at the presentation linked below for the technology.

- They have the lowest power consumption (a must for smart cards)
- It’s safe (nothing is stored on the phone).
- It’s the only company that can satisfy Google’s demand for false rejection/acceptance rate).
- It’s hardware so it’s insanely hard to copy and they have a developed the sensors for 18 years.
- They have a very broad portfolio of sensors.

**Risks**  
It’s a technology stock after all. Competition is a risk, but still the competition is nowhere to be seen. Qualcomm might come with an ultrasonic sensor in 2016 (supposed to be 2015, but we’ll see). Price pressure might come up. They say though that they are the cheapest already at about $3 per sensor (and they sell 1 million per day). For 2016 it’s estimated that the price will go down to $2.75. But, the sensors are also getting smaller (look at the Sony Xperia for example, the side sensor is very small, being less material needed and therefore higher margins).

**Additional information**  
Link to the investor presentation powerpoint that was held last week: http://www.fingerprints.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/FPC-IR-event-Dec-9-2015.pdf

The presentation on Youtube (it’s English): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxmtjByjdUI&amp;feature=youtu.be

**My two cents:**  
Tech is fun. I'm not an expert. I came in late to this stock as I was careful, I wasn't convinced until they raised the guidance for the third time this year). This is a megatrend that is taking off. FPC is leading it. The stock might not be dirt cheap now, but there is certainly a potential here (maybe not 10x in the short term anymore), but I’ll be very surprised if it doesn’t double in the next 12 months. It’s not a stock for the faint hearted. It’s extremely volatile, but hopefully it will calm down when it enters the index in Sweden and the tick size will go down considerably (meaning more robots, less daytraders) over new years.",0

15-12-14,"Aegis Capital IPO Underwriter DD ($XGTI, $HTBX, $SGNL, etc)","Wanted to share some DD I've been doing, and i think this will be good info for anyone looking for good short opportunities, or anyone owning any of these stocks should divest immediately, IMO. 

I was a bag holder for one of Aegis' stocks, $SGNL. Lost a good chunk of money, but like bag holders kept chasing the lost money.  It’d make a run and I’d jump in medium-high and then be lucky to sell medium-high. I never felt comfortable buying on the dips and a few times bought on the spikes. Pretty pathetic yoloing for a somewhat experienced trader. 

Someone here once said that you cannot be a good trader until you get over needing to be **right** about your picks. If you can believe it, even after I finished my DD on Aegis I still held some SGNL just waiting for some good pump news so i could exit. That ended up costing me an additional 10% of my investment. 

I was listening to a conference call once for SGNL, hoping to hear the news that would finally let me sell this dog, and at the end of the call some *Analysts* asked some questions that seemed overly exuberant. What firm was this analyst from? Aegis Capital, the stock’s underwriter. A word of advice: if you have a stock that you **cant wait** to sell, it’s probably a bad stock and your greed and dreams of buying a space yacht are clouding your judgement.

So I started looking into Aegis, checking a few of the stocks, and it was looking worse and worse. Finally I pulled all of their stocks into a spreadsheet and played around with a few scenarios. 

Ok, so let’s say I invested $1M equally on every single one of their IP0s, about $30k in each.. what would I have now? I’d have $500k. Ok, so they deal with a lot of biotech stocks and many of those are speculative, of the 34 IPOs they’ve acted as the lead underwriter, how many have a higher pps than the IPO pps? 

One. And it’s gained .05 on rather low volume. So if you invested $1M you’d be up $5k. Yay. 

What’s the average return? -49.7% Check this google doc for full details: 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QDFHsothAUIyeJwkCfGPmn3t_djkkMkibalqhtPhUD0/edit?usp=sharing

Pretty much every stock here looks like a classic pump and dump.

So what is Aegis up to? Basically as the underwriter they’re responsible for making sure all of the shares of an IPO are sold. For small cap companies it isn’t too difficult to find a lot of small suckers (and maybe a few big ones) through marketing the stock and planting pumps on websites like this one, StockTwits and different investing message boards. 

I'm sure they have this down to a science, and truly selling $10M of a ""Genetic Cancer Test Stock"" like SGNL is pretty easy if you think about it. Do I think SGNL is a sham company? Probably not a total sham, but I don't think they have any novel technologies and I don't see them being any more successful than they are now (read: bleeding money to sell and place their tests, which may or may not be useful), and earning higher than average industry salaries (CEO makes 500k a year.. yes, really) and probably making some nice bread on the side speculating in the company stocks knowing when PR pieces will hit. 

And like $GBSN, dilution, lots of dilution (I have DD on GBSN and Dawson James Securities if anyone is interested). I'd imagine Aegis and the principals of SGNL have profited numerous times on this stocks PR, pumping and then dumping.  


Additionally, Aegis heavily markets their stocks using paid placements and email marketing, this is something that reputable companies *sometimes* do in order to get more attention for their stock, but it’s uncommon among the more reputable firms. 

This Glass Door review of Aegis puts its mildly that most of the deals traded down, so it was hard to keep customers.

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Aegis-Capital-Reviews-E388111.htm

Also, Aegis has had its share of lawsuits and FINRA fines: 

https://www.finra.org/newsroom/2015/finra-fines-aegis-capital-corp-950000-sales-unregistered-penny-stocks-and-aml

Here's a full list of stocks that Aegis has underwritten:

•	CADTU
•	TFSCU
•	GGACU
•	REPH
•	IRT
•	RTTR
•	JAGX
•	BVXV
•	EYEG
•	BHACU

•	OAKS
•	IPDN
•	ORC
•	STML
•	CTF
•	JMI


*Possible Plays:* 

If you shorted everything here that hasn't lost a lot of its value yet, Aegis' track record says that it will soon-- and a lot of it. And if it does gain value, it's clear that it won't gain much, and whatever it gains won't be sustained. As pointed out, out of 34 IPOs **one** of them is in the green from the IPO pps, and most are down 50%, some in the 80-90 range.

* Litecoin experienced massive crash from 0.03 BTC to almost 0.008 BTC as we speak

15-12-14,Best Way To Short The Junk Bond Market?,[deleted],1
15-12-14,"Make sure you make plans to see ""The Big Short"" when it hits a theater near you.","The Big Short is based on Michael Lewis's book, about 10-15 people who realized the awful housing 08 crisis was definitely coming, and set out to make as many short sell strategies as possible on the supposedly ""AAA"" mortgage bonds that were much closer to super junk status. These supposedly safe bonds and the way they were abused were a big part of what caused the 07-08 crash. 

Was lucky to notice that it had an early showing at one theater in Chicago and saw it yesterday. I believe it's probably also out in LA and New York and maybe a few other limited releases until everywhere December 23rd.

Star studded cast, and did not dumb down most of the finance language. However, it frequently interrupts the story to tell you in layman's terms what is going on in hilarious ways. Much more finance than something like Wolf of Wallstreet but very entertaining to I feel anyone who enjoys and cares about investing. Thought it portrayed some trading office culture very well. 

I'm sure I will find there are some biases as I continue researching, but I felt it was a great way to start learning in depth about the crisis.

GoPro management has attributed weak response to the Session camera, and the associated price cuts (now $199 vs. original MSRP of $399) to poor consumer awareness exacerbated by poor launch timing (right around the July 4th holiday), minimal marketing, inappropriate pricing, and a host of other issues. We agree that all of those issues have contributed to poor demand, but believe that the bigger issue is that key challenges of off- loading, storage and editing content have not been adequately addressed for a product intended to be ""taken anywhere to record everything."" The fact that the Session is intended to be used more than the other cameras in the GoPro line-up just makes those challenges worse—there is likely to be more footage and therefore a lower percentage of usable content.",434

15-12-15,How is the American Funds Target Date Beating Vanguard Since Inception (2007)?,"A friend was just given a sales presentation by Edward Jones to set up their 401k (small office, 10  employees).   The fund selections will, of course, be American Funds.  My first instinct was, also, of course, ""oh hell no...""

I explained the birds and the bees of fund expenses and loads.  The American Funds brochure actually had a lot of great material already.  They had a page about how a small difference in expenses can add up and provided an illustration of how their target date funds were 10bp cheaper than industry average (1.10% vs 1.20%).   Then I scribbled a line on the chart where a vanguard target date would be.

(The share class for American is R-3, which as I have read will not have a front or back-end load.)

Anyway, my argument fell apart when I tried to show how such a fund must necessarily lag by an amount that would probably be near the expense ratio.  I chose to use the 2035 target date fund from Vanguard as the comparison.

I first went to yahoo finance to do a comparison graph, and that was super close.  Then I figured maybe the price return had some disparity in the distributions, so then to Morningstar:

   * http://i.imgur.com/al0dcz3.png

Nearly identical performance, with the American Funds slightly outperforming.

As another test, hellomoney:

   * https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/4fe613-american-funds-2035-r-3
   * https://hellomoney.co/portfolio/18d810-vanguard-2035-target-date-investor

Click on 5yr for vanguard, since there is no 10yr for american.

How can this be?  Better return, and less risk, at all time intervals, despite the ridiculous fees?

Am I overlooking some key detail?  Has this actively managed fund of actively managed funds just straight up done better?  I recognize that if has just done better, that we can't count on it to do better forever.

-Biotech is believed to be in a bubble.  However, IBB is currently down 15% from its July peak.

15-12-15,How do you calculate the value of the $YHOO stub?,"It's a bit misleading when journalists say that the market value of $YHOO is less than the market value of their stake in $BABA. What about taxes, eh? The spin-out fiasco points to the problem with the whole comparison.

However, there has to be a way to guestimate the value?

***

Let's start with a bit of data:

Stock | Price | No.Shares | Market Value
:-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------:
[$YHOO](https://stockflare.com/stocks/YHOO.O) | 432.59 | 944 | $30.8bn
[$BABA](https://stockflare.com/stocks/BABA.K) | $80.57 | 2,496 | $201.1bn
[Yahoo Japan](https://stockflare.com/stocks/4689.T) ADR | $8.25 | 2,848 | $23.5bn

Now, here's the latest [quarterly report](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1011006/000119312515368412/d27304d10q.htm) from the SEC. In it, there is the following stats on Alibaba:

Date | Dec-14 | Sep-15
:-------- | :--------: | :--------:
Investment in $BABA |$39.9bn | $22.6bn
Deferred tax re: $BABA | $16.2bn | $9.1bn
as % | 41% | 40%

Furthermore it states that the tax bill on the $10.3bn sales at IPO was $3.3bn (i.e. 32%).

So, if we assume a tax of 35% on the remaining shares (part-way between 32% and 41%) then what would the stub at Yahoo! be worth? Also what tax rate do we need to apply to the stake in Yahoo! Japan where they [own](http://ir.yahoo.co.jp/en/holder/status.html) 2bn shares (= 1bn ADRs)

 | Owns | % | Gross value | tax rate % | Net value
:-------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------:
$YHOO | n/a | n/a | $30.8bn | n/a | $30.8bn
$BABA | 384 | 15% | $30.9bn | 35% | $20.1bn
Yahoo Japan ADR | 1010 | 35% | $8.3bn | 35% | $5.4bn
 |  |  |  |  | 
Yahoo ""Stub"" | n/a | n/a | n/a | n/a | $5.3bn
per share |  |  |  |  | $5.56

Anyone got corrections to the math? Suggestions?

***

Of course, if we can get a ball park valuation for the Yahoo! stub, then we can start thinking about the value of that business itself!

I think its best to do it when the expected move isn't so high. Currently the This trade costs about $485 and will be profitable, only IF the SPY moves past approx 208 or approx below 197.75.

SPY expected range is +/- 3 to 4. So at this price, I don't think it will be worth it  since there is no catalyst come expiration.

15-12-15,Kitov Pharmaceuticals (KTOV) DD: phase 3 pre-market tomorrow,"Kitov Pharmaceuticals is an Israeli clinical stage pharmaceutical company. Tomorrow they are holding a press conference to announce their phase 3 results for KIT-302. KIT-302 is basically a generic version of Celebrex that is being combined with amlodipine. A Calcium channel blocker used to lower blood pressure. The goal of the study was in my opinion watered down for a bigger play that I’ll discuss later, but the goal of the P3 study is to demonstrate that KIT-302 reduces blood pressure in the arm at least 50% effectively as amlodipine alone. Amlodipine is already FDA approved under the name Norvasc. The FDA has already approved the Phase III clinical trial design for KIT-302, in a Special Protocol Assessment, in accordance with the shortened regulatory pathway. Meaning they are pretty much fast tracked for approval. 

From my understanding of both Celebrex and Amlodipine they should not have any adverse reactions as they work in two different systems in the body. The bigger play for KTOV is to get this generic drug fast track FDA approved WITHOUT the black box warning that Celebrex currently has. Without the warning they may be able to take a large percent of the market share. 

Kitov Pharmaceuticals is a LOW float stock with about 600k shares in the float. Meaning this bad boy can run with some good news. 
The company currently has a $9.5 million market cap 
$12 million cash on hand and O debts
Making the risk of dilution low.

I always wanted to compare my portfolio's performance to Betterments and Wealthfronts all stock portfolio and any other roboadvisor I can find. I could find Betterment's but Wealthfront does not make it easy to see their performance and now I understand why. 

&gt;&gt;....they were Wall Street’s newest and slickest way to charge higher fees for something that wouldn’t beat a basic low fee index approach. Now that one year is officially in the books we can begin to assess how these Robo Advisors are doing and whether their claims about “better performance” and “additional returns” of up to “4.6%” are valid.

&gt;&gt;The results for 2014 were not good and they certainly don’t come close to the exaggerated claims of adding up to 4.6% in “additional returns”. 

&gt;&gt;Make no mistake about these portfolio services.  You are not paying for “better” performance. You are paying a premium over a Vanguard Indexing account with the hope that the automation, tax loss harvesting and convenience will make your life easier. And in a year like 2014 that premium actually amounts to much more than  few basis points – it resulted in several PERCENTAGE POINTS due to the broad underperformance. All of this might be worth a premium to some people, but in most cases I see no reason why you can’t choose a simple 1, 2, 3 or 4 fund Vanguard account and be diligent about rebalancing once a year.

6) I have a chevy cobalt 2008 and some furniture.  Computer, etc.

7) I don't need the money anytime soon, I'm young and careful about my money and don't spend much.  So I'll probably be looking to retire/ramp down work in 40+ years.

9) I took an investor profile test and got aggressive/moderately aggressive (I'm not sure about about 2 of my answers to the questions, which is why I listed both).

10)  My dad says to just invest in the sp 500 and mid cap indicies to avoid additional fees and because I have time so I don't need to worry about making a lot of money quickly; however, the return rates on some of the aggressive options (i.e. wells fargo advantage discovery instl SA63 among others) look enticing.

15-12-15,"Fingerprint Cards. (STO: FING-B) - Biometry, extreme growth and high profitability","I thought I’d write a short intro to a very exciting Swedish company called Fingerprint Cards (STO: FING-B, hereafter FPC). I bet a lot of people here have heard about them (and indeed maybe own shares). Some will probably know it a lot better than I do, but this is a start. Even though it’s a small company (market cap of slightly more than $3.5 billion), it’s one of the most traded stocks in Europe. I’m from Norway, and the FPC has a higher trade volume on an average day than the entire stock exchange in Norway.

So, what do they do? They make fingerprint scanners for smartphones, tablets and soon to be smartcards.

**Reasons for reading on:**  

- It’s the fastest growing company in Europe (words of the CEO a couple of days ago).  
- I mean it’s still a good buy even though it’s up 1300% so far this year.  
- They have a highly scalable business model.  
- They have, seemingly, the best technology.  

**History and competition**  
18 years ago there were a couple of players in the fingerprint business. You had the Americans Authentec and Synaptics and FPC. A few more players have entered the scene later on. Chinese Goodix is the most notable of them now, as well as a couple of Norwegian companies (Idex and Next Biometrics). Nothing really happened before Authentec was bought by Apple and released the Iphone 5s with touch id. Suddenly everyone wanted a fingerprint scanner on their phone. The breakthrough for FPC was when Huawei launched their Mate 7 in 2014 with a sensor from FPC. So what about Synaptics? They deliver the sensors for all Samsung-phones.

**Financials**  
Revenue (in SEK (divide by 8,5 to get USD)):
2012: 12 million  
2013: 94 million  
2014: 233 million  
2015: 2.8 billion (estimated)  
2016: 7.5 billion (middle range of guided 6.5-8.5 last week).  
2017: ?  

They say their gross margin will be roughly the same as the second half of 2015 which has been 45%(!). With 22% tax, 550m in Opex (roughly) we’re looking at a positive cash flow of over 2 billion sek next year. If the middle range of the guided will come through. This year though, they have increased their guiding 4 or 5 times because of the explosive market. I think they are careful for 2016. A guiding of 6.5 billion leaves almost no market growth (q over q) as Q4 2015 will have a revenue of about 1.3billion alone and Q1 should be around 1.4-1.5 billion.

**Customers**  
FPC stated that their goal was to have 50% of the addressable market of fingerprint sensor market for smartphones in 2014. In practice they probably have 85-90%. They are sweeping the floor with the competition.

9 out of the 10 biggest smartphone players in China are customers of FPC. 42 phones have launched in China with FPC to date. Huawei, Lenovo, Xiaomi, ZTE, Oppo, Coolpad, Vivo, Gionee, Meizu and a lot of smaller all have phones with FPC technology.

The biggest market is still outside of China for FPC. Obviously Huawei (who really are all in and 100m phone sales in 2016 should net FPC 2.4 billion in revenue alone) is the biggest. Google is the

In 2015 53 smarthphones/tablets with FPC have been launched with 24 OEMs. 2 phones were launched in 2014.

**Brands outside of China:**  
LG
Sony
Google (the new Nexus phones by LG and Huawei). Google also included FPC in the work with Android M.
Microsoft (Surface 4 pro)
Blu
Nextbit Robin (Kickstarter project)

**The competition and their phones:**  
Synaptics: They have Samsung, and are struggling. Some think that Samsung will come to FPC. That would be HUGE. They also have Sharp.
Apple: Only inhouse
Next Biometrics: No phones to date
Idex: No phones to date
Goodix: They won TCL (top 10 in China, but probably can’t sell it outside of China because of patent issues). Goodix previously had Meizu which FPC now has.

A lot of smaller niche phones have been released as well with unknown sensor producer.

**Growing market**  
The fingerprint sensor penetration (the number of phones with a sensor that is released of the total amount) is slightly above 30% for 2015. About 100m sensors this yearFPC says that 2016 the number will be a bit more than 50% (about 300m will be FPCs share probably). This will continue to increase until 100% of the phones are released with a sensor (2020ish).

**New business opportunities**  
Smartcards is coming soon to try to stop the bleeding of customers from credit cards to smartphone payment systems. It’s in development and starting commercialization in 2016. In 2018 the smartcard market, according to FPC, will be as big as the smartphone market in 2016 (7,5 billion more for FPC?). Who has the technology for smartcards? So far, only FPC who is leading this together with Zwipe and Mastercard plus some unknown fintech companies.

Check out Kickstarter and see how many new projects feature fingerprint sensors. They are coming everywhere. Smart locks for bikes. Smart homes. Internet of things. Medical equipment. Guns. Passports. Automotive industry. This is just the beginning of this mega trend.

**The Stock**  
The stock is a WILD ride. From the low of 30ish this year it’s at 494 now. However, 7 trading days ago it closed at 675 before the guiding of 2016. Since it has dropped like a stone, was down to 421 today. 

Now, what is a fair valuation of a company that grows 1000% from 2014 to 2015 and looking at 200% 2015-2016? Current valuation gives a forward P/E of around 10 if they hit the top of the guiding. I personally believe they will top their guided range. Based on 2015 numbers they are trading at a P/E of 37,5 (but bear in mind that the revenue for Q1-Q3 have been 140m - 460m - 960m and Q4 is looking at 1300m). 

**Outlook:**  
5% of the stock (about 3 million shares) is shorted which also has caused the downfall last week. They might have to close the short prior to 21st of December (FPC enters Eurostoxx 600 index) or 4th of January (enters the OMX30 index). A few million shares will be bought by index funds of the total of 64 million shares.

**Technology**  
I advice to take a look at the presentation linked below for the technology.

- They have the lowest power consumption (a must for smart cards)
- It’s safe (nothing is stored on the phone).
- It’s the only company that can satisfy Google’s demand for false rejection/acceptance rate).
- It’s hardware so it’s insanely hard to copy and they have a developed the sensors for 18 years.
- They have a very broad portfolio of sensors.

**Risks**  
It’s a technology stock after all. Competition is a risk, but still the competition is nowhere to be seen. Qualcomm might come with an ultrasonic sensor in 2016 (supposed to be 2015, but we’ll see). Price pressure might come up. They say though that they are the cheapest already at about $3 per sensor (and they sell 1 million per day). For 2016 it’s estimated that the price will go down to $2.75. But, the sensors are also getting smaller (look at the Sony Xperia for example, the side sensor is very small, being less material needed and therefore higher margins).

**Additional information**  
Link to the investor presentation powerpoint that was held last week: http://www.fingerprints.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/09/FPC-IR-event-Dec-9-2015.pdf

The presentation on Youtube (it’s English): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxmtjByjdUI&amp;feature=youtu.be

**My two cents:**  
Tech is fun. I'm not an expert. I came in late to this stock as I was careful, I wasn't convinced until they raised the guidance for the third time this year). This is a megatrend that is taking off. FPC is leading it. The stock might not be dirt cheap now, but there is certainly a potential here (maybe not 10x in the short term anymore), but I’ll be very surprised if it doesn’t double in the next 12 months. It’s not a stock for the faint hearted. It’s extremely volatile, but hopefully it will calm down when it enters the index in Sweden and the tick size will go down considerably (meaning more robots, less daytraders) over new years.

Every day, I will be designating a ticker and creating a post for ""DD Of The Day"". All WSBers are invited to do their own DD on the stock and share it with us in the comment section. Your DD may be based on technical analysis or fundamental analysis, and may be for a short, medium, or long term timeframe.

I picked F for today just because it's one of my favorite stocks. Their sales have been extremely strong as of late and they've shown confidence moving forward with the deal they struck in the past few weeks with the deal they've struck with UAW.

A majority of F's income comes from Ford Credit, which is their in house financing. Having the ability to finance the sales of their own vehicles gives them a competitive edge and I expect them to benefit from the rate hike that's likely to happen at the end of the week.

I also think F is going to benefit from the scandals with GM and VW as their image becomes comparatively better and former customers loyal to GM and VW will be pushed to go with F.

I'd give the stock a BUY at it's current price level. Anytime it's under $14 I'd say accumulate. Wouldn't look to sell unless it starts nearing  $16.",37

15-12-15,"Update on my DD's","I'll be doing this every two weeks or so from now on because DD is a snapshot of a moving picture.

$ICON -- called no play @ $6.40, current $6.24.   I said this stock would meander until ER and that's exactly what it's doing.

$OSK -- called no play @ $43.27, current $38.92.  Called the contract already baked into the SP.   No significant moves until earnings show up on books.  That's exactly what it's doing.

$OMER -- called 50-150% @ 11.65, current $13.51.  Although the last 10q did not show the big profits we were all waiting on, there was enough potential to send the stock into the 50% range called by the DD several times.  This DD is still on track to meet its target on the next ER.

BGMD called 200-300% @ .63, current .58.  BGMD still awaits its FDA decision (primary catalyst) and ABT earnings on the annual report in March (secondary catalyst).   No negative catalysts are expected, the DD remains on track to meet its final price targets for q4 although the interim q3 target was missed due to earnings not appearing on the 10q.

PWE called @.60 as a long term investment.   This stock will follow oil until its next asset sale or it gets bought out.   Assets remain very high over its debt, as it pays down its debt its value should rise.  Buy out candidate under $3.   As predicted the stock is tracking oil, but its doing so at a much higher level than when the DD was published.  This remains a good buy and hold stock.

AVXL called 60-150% gains @ 5.80.   At it's peak AVXL traded at $14.80 so the DD met its goals.  Correctly called $8 on the eve of the catalyst.   The DD also called for the stock to move into a $12 trading range by the end of the year and while we are moving in that direction, AVXL is unlikely to hit that range before the first so that portion of the DD will likely fail.   However, to me AVXL remains a most excellent long term investment despite the highly successful short attack which scuttled the end of year projections.

Let me say that anyone who bought into the short propaganda and wrote AVXL off as a ""scam stock"" is a fool.   Since the DD the stock has nearly tripled once, and has doubled since its low price.  If you can't find a way to make money off a stock that does that, you really need to be in a mutual fund.

On the closed DD AMDA and ATEC remain toxic and should be avoided, although AMDA may be considered safe early in January if you still want to play its FDA.   Do be aware there will be a substantial reverse split and its FDA impact will be relatively minimal thanks to its bloated float.

15-12-15,(Canada) Wealth Management Investor vs Passive Investing,"Hi all,

I'm hitting a pretty big brick at the moment. I've always been a passive investor howevere recently I've been debating wether it is better to go through a Wealth Management Investor vs Passive Investing. The benefit of a Wealth Management Investor is my investments are handled by a pro, who does nothing but reads up on companies, something I have no time to do with working full time, however I have to pay fees. The benefit of passive investing is that I follow an index, with little to no fees.

15-12-16,DD: NVET - Nexvet Bio,"*NVET* or Nexvet Biopharma is a pharmaceutical company that specifically targets pain, inflammation, and immuno-oncology in companion animals through the use of their own proprietary mAb(s). It is for reasons both financial and scientific that I believe NVET's current price of $3.05 is severely undervalued and offers significant upside for both short and long term holds. 

*Financials* 

(As of 12/15/2015)

Market Cap - 34.95 M 

Cash - 47.66 M 

Debts / Liabilities - $0 

Book to Share - $4.25

Total Shares - 11.46M 

Float - 5.59 M 

% Held by Insiders - 48.53% 

% Held by Institutions - 31.40% 

Gross Profit - 25K (Not a typo) 

TL;DR - Low float monster that spikes hard on good PR (looking at you $11.30 52wk high). Has a 10c spread on a good day, and a couple hundred shares bought in lots can swing this 30c in either direction with ease. 

*Science* 

NVET has a proprietary platform called PETization which enables rapid monclonal mAb design, which is specifically utilized for inflammation, pain, and immuno-oncology in pets which is an absolutely massive market. 

For those unfamiliar with mAb's, mAb's or monoclonal antibodies are monospecific antibodies that are created by identical immune cells that are all derived from a single unique parent cells. For the most part these mAb's are derived from animals such as mice and rabbits, and often time the crossover into human usage is difficult. However, when dealing with mAb based pharma for pets, this is usually not the case. Because the requirements for animal consumption are far laxer then for humans, the mAb testing that NVET is currently doing does not have to follow the same rigorous guidelines Eli Lilly, NovoNordisk etc; have for their human trials. 

The lead candidate for NVET, NV-01, is a mAb developed specifically for pain in canines. However, NV-02 and NV-03 have also passed the proof of concept phase (with excellent toplines I might add) and are focused on cats and horses respectively. The diversity in the companion animal market affords generous and exponentially increasing profits if PETization can continue to create these novel mAbs for pets. 

Here is a detailed graphic that shows the current state of most of NVET's pipeline: 

http://imgur.com/HvGA1QW

As illustrated, NVET will have significant catalysts for the majority of their products from 2018 - 2022. 

*Partnerships* 

NVET is currently engaged with two very interesting partnerships with extremely large and globally relevant animal care companies.
 

The first partnership they have is with Vibrac, one of the largest animal health dedicated companies in the world. Some of the most important terms of this 10-year deal are as follows:

*Nexvet will have responsibility for development, manufacturing and supply of NV-01 while Virbac will provide clinical and regulatory advice and have responsibility for distribution, marketing and sales of NV-01 in Europe and other non-U.S. or Canadian territories.
*Nexvet will retain sole distribution rights to NV-01 in the U.S. and Canada.
*A Joint Steering Committee will be established to optimize clinical development, regulatory submissions, medical education and marketing strategies.
*The parties have agreed to share profits from Virbac’s sales of NV-01 equally. In addition, Virbac will pay Nexvet milestone payments upon NV-01’s first marketing authorization and its first commercialization in a major European country.
*Virbac will have the right to negotiate access to future Nexvet products on a product-by-product basis for development, distribution, marketing and sales. This is subject to separately agreed- upon financial terms.

The second, and more recent partnership, was an agreement with one of the leading Japanese animal health companies Zenoaq to develop a number of therapeutic biologics for pets. These biologics will target undisclosedprotiens involved in the areas of immuno-oncology and allergy/inflammation. 

Some of the key terms of the deal are as follows: 

*Nexvet will apply its PETization technology to Zenoaq monoclonal antibodies (""mAbs"") already identified as having therapeutic potential in companion animals.
*Development costs will be shared equally
*Zenoaq will retain European and Asian marketing rights to developed products, with Nexvet retaining rights to the rest of the world, including the United States.

These two partnerships offer NVET not only a marketing and distribution platform both domestic and abroad, but also milestone payments from Vibrac. These two companies have proven track records, and have pushed many animal related biopharmaceuticals to market in the past. 

*Final Thoughts* 

Like any biotech company this is speculative to a certain extent. Investors (or even swing traders) should find solace in this play for two reasons: Firstly, is that this company completely been decimated in regards to PPS to the point it is trading well below cash and book. The 200-MA is somewhere around $4.20 - a price I see it returning to Q1-Q2 of next year. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, the future of these trials falls on the back of animal and not human testing. I cannot stress how much better NVET's chances are for this matter alone. 

*Disclosure*

I am / We are not certified financial advisors, and anything said here is opinion and should be treated as such. We assume no risk for any decisions made based upon the above. I am / We are also long NVET and reserve the right to liquidate my position without any notification. 


*PS*

Basically, the companies recent success in its pivotal safety and efficacy study of NV-01 will be discussed at the Merrill Lynch Animal health Summit. This study, which was the most advanced clinical study announced for a veterinary mAb, in the area of pain management, met its primary endpoint. Dr. Heffernan will discuss the ""substantial"" body of data from this study, which they intend to use the basis of planned submissions for marketing authorizations both domestic and abroad. ",11

The way we are thinking this will work is everyone pools $2,500 for a total of $20,000. We will have monthly meetings to discuss what stock picks we want to go in on, and how we want to handle the existing portfolio (thinking initially $4K invested across 5 relatively safe stock picks to start getting our feet wet). Every quarter, everyone will invest another $250, to keep growing the portfolio.

Because we all live in Canada and have TFSAs (Tax-free savings accounts, which I believe is similar to an American Roth IRA), and are going to try and invest in that by potentially incorporating an LLC and using that as an investment vehicle.

We are compiling a bunch of questions to ask a senior accountant on feasibility of this endeavour/advice. Before we do that, I wanted to check with Reddit and see if anyone has any thoughts/advice/recommendations as it pertains to our plan.

With the Brazilian economy the way it is I think that there are some good opportunities without falling into a value trap, such as with Mahle (LEVE3). 

They provide a number of parts to automakers worldwide, and while based in Germany have moved significant operations to Brazil. My hypothesis would be that the falling Brazilian real would greatly help them as they sell most parts in markets with strong currencies (the US for instance), and have the backing of a strong parent company in Europe.",3
15-12-15,DD: Threshold Pharmaceuticals (THLD),"None of what follows should be considered investment advice.  

Threshold Pharmaceuticals had a very bad week last week, losing approximately 90% of their share value.  The shares tanked because of two phase 3 clinical trials for the same drug that failed to meet its primary endpoint, which I will say more of later.  Their earnings report for the last quarter had them with around 52M in cash, and they reaffirmed their cash of around 40-42M on their CC last week.  Their burn rate about $11M/qtr, which doesn't take into consideration income they received related to the phase 3 trials.  

The stock has a float of 71M, they currently trade at around $0.48 which puts their market cap at about 5.5-7.5M below their cash on hand.  There are no outstanding warrants, although there are approximately another 70-something million shares authorized but not issued.  A share price of $0.56-0.58 would put their market cap into the range of their cash on hand.  

I'll make a few comments about their failed trials, which may also provide a short term catalyst, but it will not be the focus here.  They make a drug which targets solid tumors.  Tumors typically convince bodies to grow blood vessels towards them, but if you think of cancer cells like a golf ball that you hit off your yacht, the cells inside the balls don't have much access to oxygen just like the pleb extract on the inside of your golf balls never really touch your precious Honma S-03.  So the cells on the inside of the tumor mass have low oxygen availability, and this drug targets them.  So pretty much the idea is if you have something eating away the inside of your golf ball, pretty soon you're not hitting a golf ball at all.  

So ,if you listen to their conference call, they talk about the one trial performed in combination with Merck.  The endpoint failed to meet statistical significance by a very small margin.  Their analysis was looking for a [hazard ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio) of 0.75 vs. placebo, and they got a p value of 0.0518.  I don't want to go into this too much, but basically, this was a very, very close result to meeting their endpoint, or a p value of 0.05 or less.  Frequently trials like this are designed so that they can may elucidate subpopulations which a more pronounced response.  Given how close this study was to meeting the primary endpoint, you could imagine how perhaps the people at Merck who designed this study can find a subpopulation in this group what would push the result into statistical significance.  This is sometimes called a post-hoc analysis.  

However, what I really find interesting here is the combination of the phase two drug with associated rights for the imaging agent.  What they're trying to do here is to target certain types of tumors where the cancer cells have little access to oxygen, and specifically have the drug become active in these types of cells. Even if there are no subpopulations that are shown to benefit in a post-hoc analysis, their phase 2 still may be a promising lead.  In the conference call they mentioned that they were exploring strategic alternatives (i.e. acquisition) and clearly Merck was interested in this path since they pursued a partnership with the 1st generation drug, it's not unreasonable to think that they wouldn't be interested in the second generation.  
Even if Merck doesn't make a play for the 2nd generation drug I think they may still be interested for the rights to the ^18 F HX4.  This is a radioactive drug which can visualize areas of tumor hypoxia, so even if MRK has other plays on tumor hypoxia in the pipeline, they could easily hedge their bets by buying THLD for their phase 2 + the rights to the HX4.  (Maybe THLD's 2nd gen drug doesn't pan out and one of MRK's other plays does...the same imaging agent could be synergistic for either drug.)  

Why would anyone care about the HX4 rights?  Well, I personally am very bullish on this frontier in medical imaging.  Think green fluorescent protein but instead of splicing the genome to find something out, the patient gets injected with a short lived radioactive tracer.  By doing this you own the diagnostic **and** the treatment, that's synergy bitches.  Anyways, LLY [bought a company](https://investor.lilly.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=527815) a few years ago that developed radiopharmaceuticals that fit their (LLY's) portfolio, MRK might come to the same conclusion.   I could maybe imagine a few other companies that would be interested in THLD's IP, but MRK makes the most sense it seems.  

In summary: I think prudent investor could make a short term gain on THLD up to at least the point where their market cap equals their cash on hand.  Factor in a possible short term catalyst in a post hoc analysis of the very very close clinical trial (with pancreatic cancer patients btw), and/or Merck or others purchasing them for their property rights, and there may be more upside to this.  

This is not investment advice, you should consider the risks carefully.  The only thing I actually think any of you should do is go fuck yourselves.

15-12-15,"$GBSN, an explanation as to what happened.","I mean no harm when I write this, and do not wish to sound like an asshole, but it's the nature of things.


A lot of people seem to be scratching their heads wondering what in the fuck happened to $GBSN. Allow me to break this down as simple as I can, without going into DD nor technicals. As I am assuming a lot of noobs haven't done, and this is why they are suffering massive blows.


In August, the stock suffered a crushing blow to the price for a few basic reasons everyone should understand. In September, the price tanked even further and was picked up by Finviz as being oversold. I saw this, and the price per share at .045 each. I generally snag penny stocks on mass panic sell offs, and profit from the rebound.


Having enough of a wad to throw at the stock to make it worth my while, I dove in, it had to rebound back to at least .06 - .07 per share.


After the tank to .045, the stock stayed pretty stagnant. Traded near sideways at .05 for a long time. People started to get antsy.


Then, out of nowhere a huge increase.

DO you know why this happened?


The CEO went on record stating that there should be 2 FDA clearances by years end. The pumpers got right in on that (I admit, I was a culprit, I pumped the shit out of that). Reason is, they had something credible, and after trading sideways for months the price could now move.


The stock soared, volume went sky high on the chance that on or around December 5th there would be FDA clearance and we would get PR. More and more people got involved because financial news sites started picking up the outrageous volume and listing it as a hardcore watch.


This December approval PR was false all along. Most of us knew that, but a lot of people didn't. While the CEO is correct in stating by year's end, we won't actually hear anything about it until January 5th (or somewhere around) for the December approvals.


Get it yet?


Then comes the R/S and dilution vote. R/S approves. Stock tanks. And then tanks some more.
We were .12 pps at close the trading day before the split, and .09 pps during that same night's AH.


Then the R/S happens. The price goes up a little bit. People start realizing their losses and don't want to wait for that FDA approval anymore. They cut their losses and profit with tax deductions.


I sold 3/4 of my position at about .25 a share, and the remaining 1/4 at .14 a share.


I tried to redeem myself for being a pumper by warning people that would listen to get out ASAP. A lot of people lost pre-split, and then furthered their losses by holding through the split. I was instantly deemed a basher and a filthy bear. Not even close to the truth.


Here are a few tips for the future, as I assume most people learned an incredibly hard lesson:


1. Penny stocks are NOT AN INVESTMENT. 


2. Penny stocks are for short term TRADING. Buy dips, sell on rips.


3. Penny stocks are ALL PUMP AND DUMP TACTICS.


4. Penny stocks are cheap as fuck, which means more people can toss 100,000k + share positions at any given time. Big multipliers means that there can be massive swings in SP.


5. DO NOT HOLD through a reverse split. Take profits prior to and re-enter when dust settles.


6. DO YOUR DD, and when dealing with bio startups, understand how FDA works.


7. Penny stocks have both the means of being incredible volatile, and incredibly stagnant.


8. If you are fresh off the boat and have no idea what is going on and placing a YOLO bet, you should take into consideration what more experienced players are saying.


9. Pigs get slaughtered.


10. If you are bullish on a penny stock, you need to learn how to be vigilant. Vigilance can often be accidentally seen as being a bear. Fuck the naysayers.


11. Bears and bashers are generally those with short interest, shorting the hell out of these cheap as fuck stocks. When short interest starts to significantly increase, you should consider an exit. Shorts will crush you.


In closing, I still remain bullish on $GBSN. They are a fairly solid company with a grasp on their unique products but lack on the financial side. I fully anticipate this stock to normalize once the FDA clearances hit, and the first ER that is released showing that those products are viable to a market.",8

Furthermore, in 2014 they reduced their long-term debt by a whopping 3.1B, compared to a reduction of 2.6B the year before and 898M two years ago. Their overall debt is 11.1B, an increase of 200M from 2013. Point is, they've been pretty effective at paying off their debt and they are not as heavily leveraged as one might think.

15-12-15,"Am I better off selling all this year if I'm at an overall loss? (x-post from PersonalFinance)","Since it's the end of the year figured this discussion could help others here as well. Two years ago I hit it big with American Airlines in bankruptcy and made around $220k in the market. This is going to be the part where you think I'm an idiot, and I understand that. I had to pay taxes on that because I accidentally sold the wrong lot at the end of 2014, but bought back in near its high. This year AAL took a huge hit from its high and therefore I am down this year. 

Overall I'm down about $30k on AAL, but I'm up $20k on the rest of my investments. Leaving me with a net loss of $10k. I have virtually no stock left in AAL, and therefore those losses are already realized.

I know I can only write-off $3k in losses. So I am thinking I am just better off unloading all of my winners (even though I am close to going long on some) and starting 2016 fresh. If I sell any of those winners next year I will have to pay gains on them, if I understand correctly.

My worry is unloading them when they're so close to long. But I'd rather pay 0% than 15% in long term gains. Am I correct in this assumption?

Here is my scenario that I'm thinking:

$30k loss AAL. $20k gain mixed investments. Total loss of $10k. Write off $3k for 2015.

vs.

**2015** $30k loss AAL. Sell in 2015. Write off $3k.

**2016** $20k gain investments. Sell in 2016. $3k losses carried forward from 2015 I can write-off. Total of $17k gain I have to pay taxes on. So it seems to make sense to sell these in 2015 instead.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*I am surmising from the other thread that this could be the scenario below:

**2015** - Loss of $30k. Write off $3k.

**2016** - Gain of $20k, minus $27k in carried forward losses (because of $3k I wrote off in 2015). Loss of $7k for 2016. Write off $3k in losses.

**2017** - Gain of $10k. Minus loss of $4k carried forward. Total gain of $6k to pay taxes on.

15-12-16,Бинарные опционы для начинающих. Блог Александра Немова.: Бинарные опционы: Стратегия торговли на пробоях и разворотах.,"Данная стратегия торговли бинарными опционами - это методика торговли в направлении тренда. 

Суть стратегии в том, что если происходит пробой линии тренда, цена резко и направлено двигается по тренду и на этом можно заработать.
Главным в этой методике является покупка опциона в направлении пробоя линии в тот момент, когда котировка еще не успела далеко продвинуться от него.

Для использования данной стратегии нужно научиться определять уровни поддержки и сопротивления. Обычно, приближаясь к этим уровням, цена отбивается от них, но, бывает, что она пробивает линию. Если так происходит, цена обычно обретает силу к дальнейшему движению, на этом нужно будет попытаться заработать.

Для примера возьмем график валютной пары EUR/USD. 

Представим на нем четко видимый уровень поддержки. Протестировав его несколько раз, цена всё-таки пробивает уровень и резко падает вниз (скорее всего, из-за сработавших ордеров покупателей, которые резко снизили цену на актив).

Следующим движением цены будет коррекция, которая отображается как возврат графика к уровню поддержки, который уже стал уровнем сопротивления. Тестируя его несколько раз, цена снова двигается вниз и несколько часов продолжает это движение. Такое поведение легко предугадать и использовать в своих целях, но для этого необходимо изучить предыдущее поведение графика и обратить внимание на:
1. Как четко цена выдерживает уровни.
2. Как резко двигается после пробоя линий поддержки/сопротивления.
3. Сколько времени нужно для возврата к пробитому уровню.

После анализа истории графика выбранного инструмента, можно начинать торговлю. 

Лучше всего придерживаться такой тактики: 
1. Рассмотрите на графике уровень поддержки или сопротивления, достаточно заметный и который цена тестировала не один раз.
2. Внимательно наблюдайте за ходом цены, пока она опять не подойдет к границе уровня. Для более удобного мониторинга подходящих торговых моментов можно использовать оповещения (alert) торговой платформы.
3. Если цена пробивает уровень, а индикаторы не показывают признаков ослабления тренда — заключайте сделку по тренду.

Обратите внимание на такие моменты:

а) Начало опциона должно быть прямо на уровне или недалеко от него. Если вы опоздали, и цена уже далеко ушла от линии — лучше воздержаться от покупки опциона и подождать следующего подходящего случая.

б) Лучше всего, если временной интервал опциона будет равняться длительности 1-2 свечей графика, на котором идет сделка. Движения после пробития уровня обычно бывает сильным, но кратковременным и сразу за ним может последовать коррекция. Например, если свечи на вашем графике равны 1 часу, время экспирации опциона не должно превышать 1-2 часов.

1. После пробоя уровня, может появиться еще одна возможность для входа в рынок — это коррекция и тестирование пробитого уровня. Коррекция и тестирование случаются в более 50% случаев при пробое уровня. В этом случае важным является ваша хладнокровность и возможность терпеливо ожидать возвращения цены. Здесь снова может пригодиться система оповещений, поскольку постоянно смотреть на график, ожидая момента для сделки, сложно психологически.

2. При возврате цены к уровню и отбоя от него можно снова открыть позицию в направлении пробоя. В этом случае временной интервал опциона можно выбирать больше, поскольку практика показывает, что повторное движение цены от линии пробоя длится дольше, чем первое. Чтобы правильно определить время экспирации — воспользуйтесь своими наблюдениями за историей графика цены.

*РЕКОМЕНДАЦИЯ:* не спешите совершать сделки одна за другой. Рынок никуда не пропадет и подходящая возможность совершить сделку будет всегда. Лучше упустить возможность заработать, чем потерять уже заработанное.

**Торговля на развороте тренда.**

Каждый вид активов реагирует на линии поддержки и сопротивления по-разному, например, валютные пары ведут себя совсем не так, как акции или товары. К тому же на рынке постоянно что-то меняется. 
Пробой уровней больше характерен графику рынка в тренде, то есть когда у цены есть конкретное направление. Когда же рынок находится в боковом движении лучше торговать по технике разворота, даже если цена и будет пробивать уровень, то эти сигналы будут ложными и не дадут прибыли.

15-12-16,"Now that we know target rate, sell longer duration bond funds?","My bond fund (AGG), which is the US Aggregate Bond index, has an effective duration of 5.36 years.  Now that we know rates will rise 1.25% total by end of 2016, that means one would expect the index to theoretically decrease in value by 6.7% in that same time frame (duration times interest rate increase).  Granted, this applies to the bonds still in the index from now till then, and there will be some turnover, maturities, and new bond purchases, so the real drop should be lower (right?).  But it doesn't seem like rising rates can make up for it.  

Is there any reason to continue to hold a bond fund for someone who needs to start drawing down from principle for retirement?  I guess the market could crash and people could flock to bonds for safety, but barring that, the math is pretty simple, right?

15-12-15,Long-term vs Short-term stock investment strategies,"Hey! First, I'm a new trader. :)
I've seen it said that you rarely make quick money in the stock market. To get gains, you must wait it out. I see this with bigger stocks and some of the ones I'm invested in are slowly growing.

But I also had the idea to possibly do short term day trading type trading (if I understand it correctly). Sort of a buy low, sell right when you see a bit of profit. Take that profit and invest in another stock and do the same thing. Growing your money slowly like that.


My question is this: Is it better to put your money in stocks and leave it longer-term (Weeks/Months/Years) in stocks or would a quick-selling strategy be best?
I feel it could be quicker to do the latter and slowly save up while having some in the long term stocks.

Google's autonomous cars will offer ""rides for hire,"" according to Bloomberg. That's still pretty vague, but it doesn't sound much different from the service Uber provides — especially since one of Uber's goals, CEO Travis Kalanick has said, is to get into the driverless car business.

15-12-16,Purchase company stocks?,"Hello,

This is a throwaway account for various reasons. The company I work for is employee owned and I was offered to buy-in this year. Approximately 50% of the employees own a share of the company. The stock is valued by the company at $135 per share this year. 

The share price has historically gone up. It started at $20 about 45 years ago, went up to $150 before the 2008 crash, dropped to $80 during the crash, and is back up to $135. The company is extremely conservative and does not have any loans or debts and has reserved cash of an amount I am unaware of. The revenue for the year is approximately $45 million and the profit is approximately $12.5 million. The profits at the end of the year are divided into employee bonuses, dividend payout, and cash reserves. The dividend this year per share is $26 (we had a busy year), last year was about $15 and the shares were valued at $115 (10-15% dividend is the norm I hear).

I believe this a good investment and the company has plenty of room to grow and expand. The company is one of the industry leaders in its respective field. I believe they target 15% yearly growth and have not missed the mark. The company requires employees to have minimum number of shares prior to being promoted to more senior levels. I am just starting out. What are your opinions?

15-12-17,SPY option trades a shitty one vs a less shitty one,"This week was the fed meeting etc and yellen be yellen. So its reasonable to expect that there will be higher volume/volatility. The market has several outcomes: 
1) no reaction spy stays flat at average trading day range between 0 and 0.75% - this is about 50 to 65% (1STD move is about +/-0.90%)
2) upbeat reaction 1 to 1.5% &lt;50%
3) extremely upbeat reaction 1.5% or more. 30% ish? maybe less?

https://www.tradingview.com/x/mrNKVmSz/
See chart. Shows time and spike in volume at news. So we know that, at least some of the time, economic events like this can have an effect.

For an event like this, a straddle is a good trade. But it can be executed poorly. If you were to have put a straddle on on monday or tuesday, your gains would be minimal.  This is a bad trade and here is why:

Example:
SPY 203
IV = 0.17
DTE = 4

The straddle was about $500. So at face value, you need almost a 3 STD move to hit that mark, based off these stats. 

Today, the outcome is you're right. Congratulations. The value of your straddle? $10. You paid $500. Hardly worth the risk.

How you could have made this trade better? 

Sell a strangle, same day, using strikes that is at least the cost of the straddle or slightly less.  If you had done this, your pay out is slightly better

Sold strangle at 198PUT and 208 Call.
Net proceeds =   $175 to $190 (depending on how patient you are).

Your total profit for this 4 leg trade is almost 300% more at $30. Still not worth it given the risk. 

So, how can you make this trade better? Given that the daily range is about expected to be 1%. If your Straddle cost is within this 1% range , then its higher probability of making money. What makes this trade even more likely is if you have an upcoming economic event on the expiration day or day before expiration day. However, Let's just take this trade without the economic event. lets just assume the SPY still has some vol in it.  

Straddle

208.50 call = 0.90
207.50 put = 1.90
cost = 2.70 

sell strangle 3 strikes wide
211 call = 0.17
204.50 put = 0.70
credit = 0.87

Straddle cost =  1.83, lets round up to 1.90 for fees and shit. 
This works out to be about 0.90% of spy price. 

Current IV of spy decreased to about 0.15. So, If we use 0.13 just to be more cautious and 2DTE, the expected range of the spy works out to be +/- 2.00. This is about 0.96%.not sure of the probability, but I'd peg the success rate of this  to be between 40-45% maybe almost 50%, this is just a rough estimate. This is just holding to expiration without any management. Of course if you manage your positions you may get better results. 

So, just by waiting for an economic event and a few days before expiration, we are able to increase our odds from the original monday straddle that had about 10-15% probability to being 40-50%.

My wife and I finally completed rollovers from retirement accounts into our Roth IRAs. During the process, we have not been contributing to our IRAs. Rather, we have been investing over the past twelve months into a joint tenant account. 

Here's the question. We are always told to put $5500 per year into our IRA, as that is the maximum non-taxable amount allowed. If that is the case, then I imagine that we should transfer funds from our joint tenant account to our IRAs. What I have never understood is how this ""maximum contribution"" applies to a Roth IRA. With it being tax free on the deposit, is there any real advantage to maxing out? Does the advantage only apply to traditional IRA's?

If the GS fund is down over that 7 years, you get your principal back (zero loss, less inflation).

How does this work? It sounds crazy, but I feel would be a great place to park money that you won't need for 7 years. Risk free investment, with double upside? It's a heads i win, tails you lose situation, or so it seems.

* 1293 W
* $0.10/kWh (the max I've paid here, usually closer to .8)

Using $2000 as my investment amount, I figure I could break even after about 200 days, or just under 7 months, and everything after that would be profit.

Wait for the breakout and go in and buy calls or puts based on the direction it decides to take for a full YOLO. Conservative people could make directional trades with vertical spreads.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3pqfea/plx_4m_insider_buy_on_monday_46m_cash_from_pfizer/

I have a small position of 1800 USD in at 0.88, which I bought because I thought the stock had some resistance around that point.  It dropped 10% from there on low volume, but today as surged to 1.00, seemingly based on the CEO picking up a few shares, and a CTO being filed.

It has I think 30% institutional ownership, which makes me feel a bit safe with this stock.  

I plan to hold my position, and possibly double it if I see the stock fall again -- They haven't put out much news, but they are still planning to do a phase 3 trial in early 2016, and they have a short horizon for the trial -- just 6 months.

What indicators tell you that a stock will perform well tomorrow if it performed well today? Do you make your plans now or wait until you see the start of an upswing tomorrow and join on the up and short the way down? I guess I'm just curious. I wish more of us used the ""Tomorrow's picks"" section of this sub for some open conversation and learning. 

Thanks guys! ",2
15-12-18,Is it possible to turn $1000 into $3000 with stock market investing?,"23yo investment newbie here. been studying a bit in this past year but i've been studying more deeply these last couple of months (specially stock markets) and, profiting about US$3000 this last year only on currency purchasing and managing alone since my country's currency fell sharply since last december, i've decided to take riskier plunges.

i have this project that will inevitably take place by the end of this next January that would require my $3000 sum to invest in. since I've got bills, tuition fees and what not to pay, I only got about $1000 that I'm willing to risk on some investment in an atempt to multiply it in one month time.

that said what would be a good investment to profit on so little time? after some research i narrowed down my options to blue chips options or small caps options trading, etoro, or trying long &amp; shorts trading but there are probably others out there that i'm oblivious to. are those good options or are there better ones? i'd only invest until  i had reached the amount that I want, not passing that.

ok investment works best when it's not a short term tryout; that's just gambling. It's not by watching hundreds of youtube vids telling you how to invest that you'll get rich on stock markets or anything. I'd probably do better by safelly investing that $1000 on some decent and trustworthy small caps and manage them fot a year at least until i get some profit, specially since I'm a newbie, but then again, it's a money I'm ok to lose trying riskier things and i need it asap

i know it might seem very dreamy but are there options that i haven't mentioned? i've just found out etoro and i think it's too good to be true; really unwilling to try it. are there better options?

15-12-18,Portfolio dropped 50% - sell or hold?,"I'm a graduate student who came across some extra money this past May. Wanting to take advantage of the TFSA increase (I'm Canadian), I put together a $6000 portfolio ($4500 toward the TFSA, $1500 on my own investing account) with the idea to hold these assets for at least a year. 

This was my first real time investing my own money, but I ran some financial analysis and they all corresponded with target prices from big banks. These stocks also had a buy/hold rating at the time, and were considered ""Undervalued."" Essentially, I thought I was making good buys became my analysis matched up with the big banks.

I invested in mainly oil and mineral companies (BBEP, BBL, DNR in US stocks, and MOZ on the TSX). When I started, I was checking in my portfolio periodically, and the prices were falling. I didn't really worry about it because my plan was to hold it until next summer. I then got busy with life and didn't really checked in much. My midterm assessment now show that I've taken a 50% hit on my portfolio, and I believe I have no dividends coming in anymore. It's not like there's *one* toxic company sinking me, but I took a 50% hit on each investment.

At this point, do I abandon ship, or do I keep to my original plan and re-assess in the summer?

tl;dr - I'm the anti-Buffet.",20

Quite an interesting article explaining why Silicon Valley valuations may be seen as marketing numbers rather than actual valuations, and predicts that valuations of technology firms like Uber will likely see a decreased valuation once they IPO.

In addition, this video complements what is stated above: Vikram Mansharamani, ""[**Two Leading Indicators - Sotheby's and Tall Towers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMQI-kl0-QE),"" *YouTube*, Januari 14, 2014. 

Perhaps somewhat incoherent, but I do think these two are viewed together well. We are in a time seeing *massive* valuations of so-called unicorns. Few people see these valuations as realistic for the underlying business; and the first article illustrates well how the headline valuations are not proper indicators of their actual valuations. 

The YouTube video shows how almost blind optimism in financial markets is not always a good sign. That is **not** to say this thread is meant as *""Oh no, a crash is coming""*; almost all the &gt;$1b startup companies are not traded publicly. If their valuations decline, I don't expect more than a ripple effect on the public financial markets. This thread is meant mostly to share this article+vid, and spark the discussion on the valuation of tech start-ups. ",27

15-12-18,Trading 10-yr bond,"A quick back story: I've been trading equities and options for quite sometime now but with the hype going on for the last year regarding rising rates, I've become interested in trading ETF's covering the movements in the bond market (ex: TBT, TLT). I recently started a job working as an accountant for a mortgage broker and I've talked with the CFO about trading the rates as it pertains to hedging the loan portfolio of the company. Recently he came in one morning and said after speaking with a friend of his who trades bonds, that the company would be going short bonds when the 10-yr hit 2.14 (at the time the 10yr was trading around 2.23%). Sure enough the market fell and the company took a massive short position, I followed suit going long TBT calls. We talked about the trade and he said he was looking for a move back to 2.3% where they would cover the short. Sure enough that move happened. When I asked him how he (or his friend) was able to identify those levels with what seemed to be quite the precision, he mumbled something about the median price. Being a former math teacher and technical analysis enthusiast, I understand what a median is, but was wondering if anyone else could elaborate. Is this just a reference to 50% retracement (ie fibbonacci retracements)? Really just looking for some insight here if anyone could care to share. ",3

15-12-20,I have some questions about shorting stocks (specifically KBIO)...,"I'm just gonna start by saying that I've never shorted a stock before, so the questions I'll be asking may be pretty basic. 


**First question -** So I know that when you short a stock your potential loss is unlimited unless you put in a stop loss on your order, right? So if I sold x shares of KBIO at $23.xx, and put in a stop loss at $30.00, then my risk is only about 22%, correct?


**Second question -** Assuming that KBIO doesn't reach $30, I get to choose when to cover (AKA buy the shares back), correct? So if KBIO drops in price to say, $10, I can tell my brokerage to cover back the shares and essentially close the trade? Now, assuming that KBIO reaches $30, my brokerage will automatically cover for me and close the trade? Right?


**Third question -** If my brokerage ""can't find"" any available shares of KBIO to short, I simply won't be able to initialize the trade, right? 


**Fourth question-** Am I stupid to think that shorting KBIO is a good idea? The stock irrationally jumped up 1600% in a single day (currently still up 1000%) after Martin Shkreli was announced as CEO. Now that he's been arrested ~~and forced to resign~~, isn't there a pretty good chance that the stock will absolutely crash to a price near its original pre-Shkreli price?


**Fifth question-** Why did trading of KBIO get ""haulted"" by Nasdaq?

15-12-18,Difference between an Accumulation fund and an Income fund and the implications (UK),"Hargreaves Lansdown offer their own multi-manager funds which are basically funds of funds ie. it's investment into 10+ focused funds wrapped into one investment.

They offer two of the same 'Income and Growth' funds; it's the same fund essentially, but one pays out gains and the other reinvests them if I am not mistaken. I've invested into their Income and growth fund (Accumulation) which takes all gains and reinvests in the same fund.

But I can't really grasp the mechanics of how this happens and if there are disadvantages to either I'm not aware of. My main question is, when I invest in a fund-fund like this, am I right in saying I'm essentially buying shares in it, and so if I chose the 'income' type, and the price of a share went up, when they paid out, I'd essentially be selling some of my shares, while my monetary stake in it remained the same value. Would this then leave me worse off if the price dropped back down again?
I don't think it would because x% is x% +/- but I just want to make sure I'm not missing something here.

Also could anyone point me to a good site to compare funds, which shows more than 4 years of history.

15-12-19,FOLLOW UP - NEXVET PHARMACEUTICALS (PRICE TARGET ADJUSTMENT),"Earlier this week I posted some DD which got very little traction: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3x0yj0/dd_nvet_nexvet_bio/

If you had followed my advice, you would be up ~23% in the black on your position as of closing bell today. However, this is *NOT* a case of me trying to suck the ego out of my own dick. I truly believe, for reasons outlined in the post above, that there is still a large amount of upside in this play.

The reason for the significant spike today, is that someone decided to buy ~800k of shares for a total price of $2.5m. This purchase immediately bumped the market cap up ~6%, meaning that it was quite a significant purchase from someone who truly believes in the company. Without trying to speculate too much, there is a good chance that this investor was present at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2015 Animal Health Summit, where Dr. Heffernan discussed the success of their leading program (NV-01). The date of the conference was December 16, 2015, meaning that the significant purchase came just a little more than 24 hours after it wrapped up. While there is no PR regarding what was said at the conference, there is a chance that this will be coming in the near future. 

For the reasons that I have outlined originally in my first post, as well as the new developments that have come for this week. I feel I need to *adjust my price point to $4.75* for some point in Q1. While I actually believe that it will go higher, 4.75 still offers ~37% upside from the current pps.

15-12-20,[DD] Relypsa,"Alright bastards, Overlord Trump here with a shitty DD.

$RLYP has received a little coverage on WSB, but it appears to by flying under the radar. Fair warning, this is a 1-3 month play, so if that doesn't interest you this is your queue to leave. Since Relypsa has been covered already, I'll keep things to a brief overview of the company &amp; my play.

Relypsa is a biotech company who recently received approval for Veltassa, a potassium binder used for treatment of hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia, or high potassium in the blood, can be a very serious condition as it can lead to serious arrhythmias, bradycardia and even sudden cardiac arrest. The company estimates 3.5 million people are a patient for the drug.

Fun fact: many lethal injection protocols use potassium chloride to stop the heart.

Anyways, hyperkalemia has gone 50 years without a new approved treatment. The current treatments are poor &amp; they include:

1. A K+ restricted diet (Americans don't do ""diets"")
2. Kayexalate, which has questionable efficacy &amp; poor gastrointestinal tolerability with effects such as severe diarrhea, GI bleeding, &amp; cell death in intestines. It is not considered a long term benefit.

and finally..

ZS-9. ZS-9 is still pending FDA approval but was recently acquired by AstraZeneca for $2.7b. Compare this with Relypsa (Veltassa) which has a current market cap of around $1.2b. Both drugs are potential best in class drugs, however Veltassa has a couple major advantages.

1. It's due to begin sales at the beginning of January giving it several first-mover advantages which they seem very prepared to capitalize on. ZS-9 likely won't receive approval until May 2016
2. In an unexpected turn of events, Veltassa showed significant and consistent blood pressure benefits on nearly all patients in all trials, which is incredibly important considering a huge majority of Veltassa patients will have some sort of heart &amp; renal disease. This potentially gives it a large advantage over ZS-9

There are lots of rumors about a potential B/O &amp; it is one of the more viable candidates right now. Whether Relypsa gets bought out or not, it is highly, highly undervalued &amp; is currently trading in the $27-29 area. As sales begin in January i believe shares will begin to enter the 30's and 40's &amp; will begin to realize a market cap competitive with ZS-9's, or higher. I won't speculate on a buyout but analysts seem convinced, having predicted B/O prices from $65-109.

Warnings - 
1. Veltassa has a black-box warning for binding to other oral medications taken within 6 hours thus potentially reducing efficacy. Since most drugs are administered daily, or bi-daily, this will likely have very little impact.
2. I'm about an [8] stoned right now, so this is likely very shitty DD.
3. This is all speculative opinion, yada yada yada, I'm not responsible for any gainz you lose, get fucked.

Hi, I was wondering if it would be more financially savvy to rent a room to live in for say $500/month or buy a house (by making a down payment, since I'd only have about $10,000 to $15,000).

I am only planning this from when I am 25 until I am 30. At age 30, I will probably buy a moderate to small sized house.

From what I understand, real estate rises, on average, 6% a year, while an index fund, such as one following the S&amp;P 500 (e.g., VOO) rises ~9% per year. I am assuming that if I bought a house at 25 years old, I would be paying $1,200 per month to live in it. On the other hand, I could rent a room to live in for $500, and use the leftover money ($700) to invest in an index fund that grows 9% per year.

According to my calculations, if I went with buying a house at 25 and paid 1,200 per month for 5 years, it would amount to a total paid of $72000. If I went with renting for $500/month, I would have $42000 to invest into an index fund. Now, in both cases, I am planning to leave the investment for about 35 years. So, if I left $72,000 grow at 6% per year for 35 years, it would grow to $522,073.82. If I rented a room, and invested the $42,000 into an index fund and let it sit for 35 years, it would grow to $786,593.26.

Therefore, it seems that I should be renting a room from the age of 25 until age 30.

What do you guys think? Should I just ""bite the bullet"" and buy a home at 25 instead, or follow my ""renting"" strategy?

15-12-20,"For folks who like to invest in market indexes or ETFs that index specific industries, commodities, etc., are there any websites that advise when to buy/sell these items?","This post is for what I believe are called swing traders... People who like to invest in industries and market indexes, but who like to move in and out of them rather than hanging on to specific ones forever. 

So what I'm looking for is a newsletter or something that, once a month or more frequently, tells me ""buy S&amp;P, buy xyz banks ETF, buy xyz large cap ETF, sell xyz commodities ETF"" and so on. Things like that. Something that knows 8/10 times it makes sense to sell in May and reminds you of that, that now is a better time to be in inverse ETFs, or that lets you know now is a good time to be in world indexes as opposed to American indexes. That sort of thing. 

I subscribe to a few things already that are stock-specific. What I have in mind would be like Motley Fool but more broad based. 

Anything like that exist?

Overview:
AGTC is developing cures for rare eye diseases with a highly specialized team of physicians and researchers. They use cutting-edge techniques to develop treatments for patients that have diseases caused by broken genes.

A single injection provides long-lasting treatment, leading to a better quality of life for patients worldwide. X-linked retinitis pigmentosa most commonly is caused by mutations in the RPGR gene, and AGTC is developing a gene therapy product for this form of XLRP. Treatment with gene therapy product slowed the loss of visual function in dogs with XLRP caused by mutations in the RPGR gene. “Based on the strong preclinical proof-of-concept data, AGTC has initiated a formal preclinical testing program that will lead to clinical evaluation of this product.” In 2016 they with Tox-Bio with partner BioGen.

The Play:
I’m not an expert with Fib fans and retracements so if /u/pcx99 could upload a photo that would be great. I analyze support at $17.34 and it has a reasonable RSI at 44 with the potential upside with its partners.

15-12-20,Is Facebook / Amazon / Netflix / Google in a bubble?,"Yes, this is a speculative post. 

It's interesting... Looking at their charts for the year, all of them started a pretty dramatic upward swing beginning back in the 3Q. Very different than the rest of the market. 

I know lots of folks, including CNBC on an almost daily basis, have been talking up ""FANG"" all year. 

Often times it is advised to wait for a dip and buy, but with all these stocks when there has been a dip, at most it has set the price back three or four months and recovered within a couple months and so one has to wonder if it was worth waiting three months to buy something at the price the stock was when they first started thinking about it. On the other hand, if this is a bubble for these stocks then maybe a real opportunity is finally approaching. 

So what are your opinions... Is this a bubble?  Or are they still a good buy?

15-12-21,Trolling my hipster relatives,"Hi /r/investing, I was talking with my family earlier and I figured this might be a fun topic to discuss. 

I have a big extended family and about half of them are serious vegan hipster musicians who I love dearly. I am however worried that if I hear one more thing about the environmental impact of cattle farms or the the consumerist mindset that is poisoning America, I might roll my eyes so hard that they will fall out of my head. 

So here is the point - what stocks can I buy my hipster relatives that will really piss them off? I was thinking that a share of Walmart or Monsanto would be a great gift. Do you guys have any suggestions? My goal is to find stocks that will get under their skin, but ideally the stock will perform well (forcing them to hold).

15-12-21,"Very beginner, is there something I'm missing here?","I am a 22 year old student with ~$13,500 saved in a Vanguard account. However, it seems like my money just sits there and in the last 2 years I've only gained about $800 or so. I feel if I learn more about investing, I may be able to increase my gains (hopefully). 

Anyways, I was looking at ""safer"" stock such as Disney for example.   But even a stock like this seems volatile? For example in the last day, the high was ~$112 and the low was $107. A $5 difference seems huge, at least to a beginner like me. Isn't there a lot of money to be made by simply looking at the trend throughout the day and buying on a downwards slope or the beginning of an upwards climb, knowing that the price would not likely drop that significantly given it's Disney? What is stopping me from buying 100 shares near a low point like $108 and selling it at even $109 for a 100$ profit (minus tax and fees, I assume). And rinse and repeat? Is there something I'm missing here? Maybe in my mind it's a lot easier said than done, I am a complete noob afterall.",2
15-12-21,Guy on Seeking Alpha has interesting thesis: buy Blackberry and dump Apple. Thoughts?,"Summary of his thesis:

&gt; * BlackBerry reported a solid quarter as the company has finally found a bottom to sales.

&gt; * BlackBerry seems like the better investment idea going into 2016 given the heightened interest for PRIV and ASP improvements.

&gt; * Whereas AAPL will likely struggle due to weakening demand for the iPhone, changing market perception, and weakening macro (due to currencies).

&gt; * I anticipate BlackBerry to sustain healthy growth rates for software and hardware, which will mitigate the roll off of SAF revenue. Software is the primary long-term growth catalyst.

&gt; * I also anticipate 30% to 50% upside for BBRY over the next 12 to 15 months whereas AAPL will struggle to produce returns over the same timeframe.

Post-market $NTI announced it is merging with western refineries. 

Part of what attracted me to NTI was basic, strong book metrics. Low P/E, huge divi, attractive books. Now the divi may end, and I'm not a huge fan of holding the bag for the premium the purchasing corporation has to make, but old-school metrics pay off too. 

Guess my only point here is that if you aren't a professional day-trader, a lot of the swings bragged about here are risky. I definitely partake, and have been rewarded and punished accordingly. But I keep 75% of my investment money in responsible plays.

Just want to point out that it works too.

I had planned to purchase a small gift or two, just browsing around the store for items I thought might be appreciated. I've been to this particular store many times before, and it's generally clean, well-maintained, has a reasonably friendly staff, and stocks decent quality merchandise.


The place--and I realize this is not an original observation on a larger scale--was a total shit-show. It must be under new management. The floors were dirty, the merchandise dominating the Christmas displays was cheap garbage, and the workers looked utterly depressed, exhausted and unhappy. If this is even partly representative of how Wal-Mart as a whole is being run these days, they're fucked.


I bought a sack of potatoes and some bananas, and left. There was nothing in that store that I wanted to burden anyone with as a ""gift."" (Not entirely true: there were some flash drives that were priced right, but they were locked to the display and I would have had to talk to one of the unhappy workers, who weren't even around when I needed them.)

15-12-22,"Investing in Canada after loonie's drop","I'm an expat Canadian and as many of you know, the loonie has dropped a ton. This looks like a crazy good opportunity for me to enter the market. I always thought the conventional wisdom was to buy low and sell high but why do I see so many articles and comments about getting the f out of the Canadian market?  
To make it clear, I do plan to retire in Canada so I was planning on a heavy Canadian portfolio anyways to save on dividend taxes (dunno if I phrased it correctly) later down the road.  
So after the loonie's insane drop and TSX's recent bear, I'd think it would be a good time to scoop up some ETFs and leave them there for 10+ years.  
This is all of course under the assumption that markets are mostly cyclical.  
  
  
EDIT: Sorry, I realize now my question wasn't very clear at all. The question is why all the fear in investing in Canada? Under current conditions it's quite cheap already from a foreigner's POV. If we're going 10+ years long, who the hell cares if it's still bearish or stagnant in 2016?",0

15-12-21,Martin Shkreli fired as CEO of KaloBios Pharmaceuticals.,"
Martin Shkreli, the embattled health care businessman, has been let go by KaloBios Pharmaceuticals — one of the companies he had headed.
KaloBios, which has a market cap of less than $100 million, hasn't traded since last Thursday. It was halted about 10 minutes after news of Shkreli's arrest on fraud charges.
On Monday, the company said Shkreli was ""terminated"" as CEO and had resigned from the board.

Martin sustained a $7 million loss on an $80 million trade that should have been profitable. Merrill force liquidated Martin at precisely the wrong moment with an order that lacked discretion (Merrill likely caused a market order, but even a massive limit order would cause price improvements that don't reflect sentiment).

So my question is how is the return calculated? based on the price of the holding? suppose I invest 100$ in a company 1$ per share so 100 shares, and one year later the stock price becomes 3$, so my investment is now worth 300$ so my ROI stands at 200? Is this how it is computed?",10

15-12-22,"I'm a complete failure. I don't want to give up, but I think I should. Veterans please advise?","Hi WSB, long time reader.

I know a few of you on here are successful traders, so I'd like your honest opinion: 

I've done nothing but make a series of horrible decisions when it comes to investing. Still make the same mistakes over and over, failing to implement simple ideas like risk management, diversification, securing profits, and cutting losses. I have about 5k left in an account which I continually kept adding money to net about 45k.

I get angry at myself when I make mistakes trading. I know it's stupid to ever try to time the bottom or top, but I get angry when I sell early on a trade and it keeps going up, even if I know that a correction is most likely going to occur, I'll buy in because my FOMO overwhelms me and makes me panic buy, I break even or lose money from the dip, because I pull out believing the money is in downward 

My biggest problem was becoming more greedy as my account fell into either direction. I tried to draw excitement from my trades so I went for short-term high profit trades doing weekly options, it was horrible. 

The balance is just one trade, one OTM trade of 300 options of EEM 30 call that expire next month so I know I'm finished. I can cash everything out, but at this point I just don't care anymore, what's the point? If I sold and the options popped, I'd feel even worse than if I kept them and lost the remaining cash. 

I want to start over next year, I have a decent paying job and am part-owner of a small business that makes some income which I can use, In total I could place what I lost back into the account, but a part of me feels like I'm never going to learn. How long does it take before you stop watching yourself making those greedy ass decisions that you know will destroy you in the long run? I know the odds, and I know this is a game of odds, but I take the worse odds anyway because I like the underdogs, I want to feel like I know how to pick the winners based on gut rather than ignoring the lessons I spent so much time studying, but I have a slip up and it costs me, I get greedy, I get worried, I ignore probability because I believe so much in worse case scenarios occurring. 

I plan to ban myself from all option trades besides covered calls, iron condors, and straddles.... I will only buy ITM options (except when doing the condor), I will only sell OTM options...

But I have friends telling me I should stop, I should just invest in a regular fund and stop managing it myself, but every year I feel like I learn more information, I feel like I'll get better. I've been doing this for 2 years, but I feel like if I don't maximize what I can put in now, I'll just regret it later if I am successful, more so than dying poor and living as a ward of the state. 

So do I call it quits for trading after this year, or do I just keep chugging? I'm pretty indifferent about losing the money at this point, but I'm torn on what I should do. Move on or make it back with more Yolos?

What would the successful traders have done if they were in my position? Have you ever been in such a sad position in your life? If not, what happens to people like me in your experience? Do I lack the discipline and capability to ever be good at this or does it just take time and practice?",6

15-12-22,BlackBerry shares soar on strong software sales,"For a company whose death has been declared multiple times, BlackBerry looked pretty good Friday. The company reported  its financials for the quarter that beat all expectations and rekindled a belief that chief executive John Chen's reputation as a turnaround expert can stay intact.

While it's far too early to call it a full comeback for the once-dominant smartphone company, investors were cheered by news of stronger sales in hardware and software. The stock closed more than 10 percent higher on Friday, ending regular trading at $8.61.

The company, overall, reported a net loss of $89 million — an improvement form the $148 million the company lost in the same period last year.

Despite that, investors saw much to be optimistic. BlackBerry is, truly, working on becoming more of a software company, trading on its still-sterling reputation for being security conscious. BlackBerry has worked to put its device management software on competitors phones, broadening its reach and reduce its reliance on breaking into a smartphone market dominated by Apple and Samsung. The company reported that it made $162 million in revenue on software and services, an increase of 183 percent from the same period last year.

It hasn't totally given up the ghost on smartphones either, having released its first Android-based handset, the Priv, in November. As its name suggests, the company is aiming this phone at consumers who put privacy high on their priority list when looking at smartphones.

BlackBerry sold 700,000 units of the Priv in the past three months, a 100,000 decline from the same period last year. But at $699, the device helped generate more revenue for the company and brought the hardware division closer to breaking even with revenue of $214 million.

In an interview on CNBC, Chen said he thinks ""the direction of our software business is really good. We really want to build out our software business.""

He added that he will make an announcement at a major consumer electronics conference next month about the company's plans to push into connected-car technology.

This week, Chen also spoke out against tech companies for refusing to grant the authorities access to the devices of their customers even when the police have warrants. While he was not specific about company names, his blog post linked to a story about Apple declining police requests for information on the mobile devices of criminals.

“We are indeed in a dark place when companies put their reputations above the greater good,” Chen wrote in a blog post titled “The Encryption Debate: a Way Forward.” “We understand, arguably more than any other large tech company, the importance of our privacy commitment to product success and brand value: privacy and security form the crux of everything we do. However, our privacy commitment does not extend to criminals.”

He added, however, that Blackberry would never give the authorities ""back-door"" access to Blackberry devices.

15-12-21,Idiot.,"Hey guys. First of all I want to thank you for all the good shit I see on here every day. 

I'm going to share with you a little tale of stupidity. It's a classic tale of ""should've jerked off before"" syndrome.
As you can tell, my flair is appropriately named as I'm very open about my mistakes. I made plans the night before to buy KTOV around market open on 12/17 and ride it up a little bit more on the hype to sell it off. Well I got in at 5.31 and held out, waiting to get enough for a yacht down payment.

Here's what I didn't know at the time of buy: 

* You can place orders in the premarket (thought it was restricted for plebs with little cash) 

* Fundamentals of the company (cash burn, liabilities, didn't even think about pipeline)

* Backup due diligence for long term hold in case it goes south

What I did feel:

* Emotion

Now I'm only messing around with $1000, but it's still frightening to think about what it could be if it was $10,000. I'm in business school, and I'm particularly embarrassed about this because I've learned how to do this shit! I've learned how to analyze the health of a company and to make guesses on the future. Like where the fuck was my head? Don't get me wrong, I've made some great money in this game; but this is a total inexcusable embarrassment. I find sharing my experience about losing to be the best ones and the most constructive for my own well being as well as for the guys on this sub.

Going forward, I'm going to take the time to find a good company on my own, do my own DD, sleep on it, jerk off, and make a cold calculated execute and ride that filthy bitch up on my own confidence and conviction. 


Thanks guys. Merry Christmas. Go America.

Recently Veloxis changed it ceo from Dr. William J. Polvino, to Craig A. Collard effective immediately. Craig A. Collard has over 20 years experience in strategic and tactic  leadership within the pharmaceutical industry. The important aspect of this CEO change, is that Craig will improve Veloxis position to enter the phase of commercialisation.

Three days ago, /u/metametamind asked for an update on this portfolio. The results thus far can be found [**here**](http://i.imgur.com/ktvGuFe.png).

A few points of attention:

- Every fund manager started with ~$10,000. 
- As some fund managers had more than 1 stock, I divided the $10,000 equally over the two or three stocks.
- As not all stocks are denominated in USD, you will find some apparent outliers, e.g. Arkema France (EUR) and BBA Aviation PLC (GBP). 
- The results under *unrealized (%)* do not take into account fluctuations in currency fluctuations; the stocks are presumed to be hedged for currency risk. 
- It appears as if my broker has stopped supporting Woolsworth Ltd. Ironically, on November 19, 2015, Woolsworth Ltd. was trading at AUD 23.61, which is exactly where it is today. Thus, the result of Woolsworth Ltd. (0.00%) – by lucky incidence – appears to be right.

15-12-22,$DRIO FDA Approval this morning!,"This is fantastic News coming Late in Q4! It has a $3.50 Price target!

PR Newswire
LabStyle Innovations Corp. (OTCQB: DRIO), developer of the Dario(TM) Diabetes Management Solution, today announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted 510(k) clearance for the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System, including its components, the Dario Blood Glucose Meter, Dario Blood Glucose Test Strips, Dario Glucose Control Solutions and the Dario app on the Apple iOS 6.1 platform and higher.

""We are very pleased and excited to receive the FDA's marketing clearance for Dario. While Dario has already been approved in numerous countries throughout the world, the U.S. is the single largest market in the global blood glucose monitoring market."" stated LabStyle Chairman and CEO Erez Raphael. ""We believe sales in the U.S. will have a substantial impact on LabStyle's financial performance and value.""

""Based on our experience in the markets where we've already launched, we believe Dario offers a superior user engagement when compared to alternative devices. We believe people in the U.S. will have a similarly favorable user experience. This is the core competitive advantage of Dario,"" added Todd Durniak, LabStyle's Executive Vice President and General Manager for the U.S. ""Having received marketing clearance, we are now preparing for the imminent launch of Dario in the U.S.""

""In the future we look forward to expanding the indications and platforms on which Dario will be used in the U.S.,"" Durniak added.

The Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System is indicated for the quantitative measurement of glucose (sugar) in fresh capillary whole blood samples drawn from the fingertips. The compact all-in-one system helps people with diabetes monitor their blood sugar levels and proactively manages their diabetes using their smartphone. Dario connects via a headphone jack to turn a mobile device into a glucose monitor, and incorporates a lancing device and test strips together with the meter in an all-in-one easy to carry device to take blood glucose measurements on the spot. Unlike conventional glucose monitors, there is no carrying case or batteries to replace. Dario provides real-time and historical blood glucose data to allow health care providers to spot patterns, recommend treatments and support behavior changes. Dario's web interface also makes it easy for users to share health information with healthcare providers and loved ones.

15-12-22,Please help me understand defined maturity bond ETFs,"I am looking at purchasing some Guggenheim Bulletshares using their High Yield Corporate defined maturity products, as I anticipate a need for cash in the shorter term, and don't want to be in bond ETFs over the next few years in a rising rate environment in order to protect my principal.  

http://guggenheiminvestments.com/products/etf/bulletshares

For those unaware, these are ETFs which hold an actual bond portfolio which matures on or around Dec of the year in the ETF name.  You are entitled to the distributions, and also absorb any defaults of the underlying portfolio.  It trades on the market (it's an ETF), but as the bonds mature, the fund manager holds the cash (does not reinvest in new bonds).  Then in Dec, you get a final distribution which is the value of all the cash from the bonds reaching maturity.  

So in my mind, when an investor anticipates a need for cash at a defined future date, these funds are a good vehicle for being in bonds in a rising rate environment.  It has the benefit of owning an individual bond vs a bond fund (reasonable expectation of receiving back the original principal at a defined date).

What I don't understand is how to find out what the final payout will be.  Will it be NAV?  This doesn't make sense to me, because the NAV changes with market demand and has interest rate risk, but in theory, the bonds in these defined maturity portfolios should mature at their original principal value.  So in my mind, the final distribution should be the original purchase price of all the bonds, minus whatever percent defaulted.  

I can't seem to find information anywhere on what the ""original value"" of all the bonds were at inception.  It's not listed anywhere on Guggenheim's site, that I can find.  Conversely, the iShares versions of these products have an easy to remember ""base value"": $20 a share is what all their funds started as.  So one can easily calculate what their final payout might be assuming various default percentages (ie, 5% default = $19 final payout).

Is there an equivalent for the Bulletshares?  Again, I understand that the NAV is what I can buy/sell for today at current supply/demand, but I want to better understand what the values might be at maturity.

Thanks!

15-12-21,[Advice Request] Need advice about my Facebook RSUs,"Next year I'm going to start a new job at Facebook that will give me 160k in RSUs over 4 years. However, the RSUs given is based on the average price of stocks the month before my start date.
How should I maximize my earnings? In other terms, what is the month after the worst month for stocks?

I've seen that while September is generally the worst, it seems like crashes usually occur near late September or October so it might be better for me to start in November or December or even 2017 January.

However, Facebook stock seems to be growing quite a bit so I'm worried that the stock will grow over the holidays and lose a lot of potential upside.

Any advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance.",0

BitGold is a Canadian company on the TSXV exchange offering international savings and payments services which allow people and businesses to send payments and hold savings with physical gold. Its headquarters are in Toronto, Canada. They IPO'd this year at 90c and are now trading at $4 a share after rising as high as $8. They are venture funded by Soros Brothers and have $30m in cash and assets with no debt. 


In an all stock deal shortly after launch they bought Goldmoney which stores over $1.5bn in physical gold for customers. This business was not technologically developed at all and Bitgold are updating with a money transfer and payments technology to leverage the existing storage business. 

Essentially, you can buy or sell Gold at spot + 1% or spend it with a debit card or transfer it between people. Because Gold is used at the base currency there are no exchange fees for transfers.

As a real world example of the savings from having no fees sending EUR1500 costs CAD$2,390 with Paypal, but only CAD$2,300 through Bitgold.

15-12-21,Can you do anything with old General Motors stock?,"Apologies if this is a dumb question, I really have no idea about this kind of stuff.

Here's my story. My family worked for General Motors when I was growing up, and as such I always had some stock. Not much, but enough where I was the only 16 year old I knew who had to pay taxes because of a little bit of dividends. Of course, GM declared chapter 11 and now there's the ""new"" GM.

I was doing some end of the year cleaning today and found a printout from pre-chapter 11 of the amount of stock I had. I did a little bit of research on the google machine and found that ""old"" GM was renamed Motors Liquidation Company, and is now Motors Liquidation Company General Unsecured Creditors Trust with the symbol of MTLQU.

I hadn't thought about this stuff in years. If I was just a plain old stockholder in ""old"" GM, would I have been issued any stock for MTLQU? If I was, how would I go about verifying this? And can you even sell MTLQU, who would buy it?",16

15-12-22,[Research] $TSLA,"#The Cyborg Swarm: Tesla’s First Real Chance to Disrupt
------------

Last October, Tesla initiated a global machine learning effort to accelerate the development of fully autonomous transport. Success here opens up multiple opportunities in the $10 trillion market for mobility. 

***Let’s begin with a simple question: Has Tesla truly disrupted the auto industry? We would argue, no. Not yet, at least.*** While Tesla deserves credit for bringing to market a compelling EV, we would not go so far as to say that the company has disrupted the auto industry business model. In fact, many aspects of Tesla’s business (private ownership, human driving) are reminiscent of the auto business model familiar to Henry Ford over 100 years ago. Going 0 to 60 in under 3 seconds in a $120,000 car is not disruptive, in our view. For Tesla to secure its long term growth, profitability and independence we believe this must eventually change. 


***Tesla’s mission statement: 'to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable transport'.*** Since the company’s inception, the market has focused almost myopically on Tesla's EVs. However, in addition to the consumption of finite natural resources (approx. 500 billion gallons of gasoline consumed annually – equal to ½ a cubic mile of fuel), there are other key areas where the current auto industry is unsustainable and can be addressed by technology, in our view: 

***(1) Utilization.*** On a vehicle basis, cars are utilized less than 4% of the time. On an available seat mile basis, cars are utilized slightly more than 1% of the time. This has not changed materially in over a century. 

***(2) Time.*** At an average speed of 25mph, the world’s drivers spend around 400 billion hours behind the wheel. At an economic value of around $10/hour, this implies a value-of-time spent in the car at around $4 trillion. A very significant portion of an average driver’s non-sleeping, non-working time is spent behind the wheel. See our October 6th 2015 report: The Car as a 'Time Machine': What’s 400 Billion Hours Worth? 

***(3) Safety.*** According to the WHO, nearly 3,500 people die in traffic-related accidents globally every day. In the US, motor vehicle accidents represent by far the #1 cause of death of young people (21% of population age between 1 and 24 years old based on 2013 data) and are on track to claim nearly 40k lives in total in 2016. Social externalities like this may also be considered unsustainable. 

***Autonomous cars can address multiple unsustainable features of the current auto industry.*** While the fundamental technologies of Level 4 (fully autonomous) cars are well developed today, there is a significant amount of development and testing required to make autonomous driving not just safer than human driving, but many thousands of times safer. Our discussions with academics and scientists in this field suggest there is no substitute for real world testing on public roads to immerse these vehicles in the chaotic, unpredictable situational/physical world of driving. 


***Google’s self-driving car program is currently logging more than 15k miles per week of autonomous driving, accumulating more than 1.2 million autonomous miles since inception. Tesla’s global fleet of around 100k Model S units is driving (on our estimates) in aggregate nearly 1 billion miles per year or nearly 3 million miles per day.*** On our calculations, this figure should double over the next 15 to 18 months. While Tesla’s vehicles are not currently equipped with a sensor suite as rich as a Google autonomous testing prototype (and while not all of Tesla’s miles traveled are autonomous miles) the mere scale of the swarm of connected, semi-autonomous EVs puts Tesla at a potentially material advantage vs. peers. Tesla’s cars are actively collecting information about the vehicle and its physical surroundings for learning at a local and centralized level on a global scale and in near real time. Tesla’s continual development of a network of assets in the field (charging stations, stores, service centers) complement the effort. 

***We cannot say with certainty what Tesla is learning from its fleet nor how great this advantage is, if any. The market is reliant on Tesla to communicate its findings and to implement any learnings in future updates of software and hardware over time.*** It is our view that, like all major car companies, Tesla’s business of selling human-driven machines utilized &lt;4% of the time is not sustainable. Firms like Ferrari (rated OW, $56 target) may target a niche market that values driving pleasure over mere transportation. However, we believe Tesla has far greater ambitions to provide transportation solutions and services at a very large scale. 


***Nearly 100% of the upside to our $450 price target for Tesla is predicated on the development of a shared electric autonomous transport service we have called Tesla Mobility. In our opinion, excluding such a potential initiative would be adverse to the risk-adjusted return inherent in the equity price.*** Clearly, we believe Tesla has an opportunity to lead the industry in shared autonomous transport, but not without risk. Specifically, we’d highlight 3 main risks that investors must consider heading into 2016: 

***(1) Burn rate***. Tesla may have proven skeptics wrong with its ability to bring to market an exciting and functional EV, but it has yet to prove wrong those who doubt they can do so with strong margins and cash flow. In fact, difficulties in manufacturing and high spending on future projects have come at a cost of very high cash burn relative to both sales and market cap. 

***(2) Access to financial capital.*** Starting any new business is hard work. But Tesla has enjoyed access to attractively priced, long-term capital to fund cash burn while making a host of long-dated technology investments. Elon Musk’s ability to raise capital has been critical to the evolution of the firm’s commercial ambition. The next 12 months will require a continuation of this relationship for Tesla to sustain its investment with minimal dilution. 

***(3) Access to human capital.*** We can imagine that, in his effort to transform the auto industry with software technology, Elon Musk could have expected the likes of Apple (OW, $108.80, covered by Katy Huberty) and Google (OW, $750.03, covered by Brian Nowak) to one day present a formidable competitive force. Perhaps he didn’t expect that day to come so soon. Tesla finds itself competing for the most precious resource required to maintain and accelerate a sustainable advantage in the disruption of automotive transport: talent. It is our understanding that numerous firms, both public and private, incumbent and new-entrant are compiling teams of advanced software engineers and experts in fields such as robotics and AI with the focus on developing autonomous EVs. Tesla is not alone in this battle.

15-12-23,TRID regulations when closing on home,"Hello, I am purchasing a duplex in Wisconsin and I have a conventional loan with 20% down. When the loan was previously approved, the banks underwriter considered stock options which I had available. The closing date is Monday and I guess because of TRID they must go through underwriting again.. I am being credited some money from the security deposits and pro rated rent.. so the full 20% down is not needed for closing. Because of this I saved based on amount I needed to close and decided NOT to liquidate any stock for the full 20% down.. but the bank is stating because of TRID they cannot take into account credits we are getting (specifically security deposits), they are saying we must liquidate stock to bring total available to the 20% down total. I find this incredibly stupid because any stocks I exercise will not even be used on day of closing.

Is the bank wrong on this?? Is this how TRID works?",7

15-12-22,Why I think Twitter should be trading at $5 today,"To begin with, the underwriting price was set high at $26. Stock went public on 11-7-13 and opened at $45.10, 73% higher than IPO should have been, but interestingly closed low at $44.9, -0.44% on its first day. Twitter has been on market for total of 533 trading days. On 12-26-13 stock reached all-time high of $74.73 and since it failed resistance tests two more times at $52 price ranges. 12-3-15 was the last time stock traded near IPO at $25.90 and it hasn’t reached the bottom yet.  I believe if investors need to see constant annual growth from Twitter, stock must bottom under $10 to be fair. Financials don’t back up the company either; net loss per share in each quarter is roughly (0.30) since the beginning of 2013. Net loss in cash continues $500M annually. Spending in sales and marketing continues to rise but still generating losses from operations. Two ways shareholders can behave: we can continue purchase now and maintain base, on anticipation on future growth in all figures (users, revenue, etc) or don’t sell &amp; at market price and lose money, put your own price in the sell order. If Amazon is trading at $600 on future expectations, I believe Twitter shares are worth at least $45.00 right now, so I limit some of my shares there. Market does not think so, in near term it is headed to August 24 all-time low of $21.01. If market trades below $21, then I limit orders all the way to $9. Historically stock has dropped over 10 points numerous times on all-time lows. There has been massive insider selling also going on since 2013, everyone is selling. For instance, Evan Williams sold over 127M shares since November 2013. My outlook is this, shareholders cannot expect major upside or even any upside in near term, it may take 36 months to recover $75 price levels, valuating Twitter back to $50B. Meanwhile, I am buying at day’s lows; last purchase was at $22.75, one before $22.79. Also my limit sell order is entered at $75. If all current and future shareholders bid under $10, we can leave IPO valuation misconception behind and fast-forward to annual growth stage. I believe Twitter has great potential to be least $50B Company. Company cannot end up like Myspace or Groupon, idea is good, but poor execution in innovation to capitalize more on existing users. Twitter is still unpolished in my opinion; needs major restructuring to become more futuristic and sexy, upgraded design is necessary, additional features are needed, VoIP, photos, mini videos, all need to come together in one place. Thousand improvements can be made to the existing framework; thousand new ideas can be invented and applied to make company better. For example, I’d simply charge optional one-time fee to those users who want to be verified as real humans and get green, orange or whatever color stickers. Company can increase spending in R&amp;D as long as results are delivered. Outsider think tanks can be hired as contractors to use given resources to innovate ideas, create additional revenue channels, cut unnecessary costs, establish new partnerships, etc. Money is there to build and innovate, needs to be put to work. Hiring similar minds as ones already working at twitter is unhelpful. Twitter is a go-to social-information tool for politicians, celebrities, large corporations, every-day humans who want to interact with the world in real time. I am not shorting, and would not recommend shorting your own companies in tough times. If you own twitter stock, simply don’t sell at market price. Remember to have sell order entered at price you think Twitter should be trading. Smart companies should acquire Twitter, the best real-time information tool. I personally see a potential for Twitter to be #1 social media site, why not? Many are unaware of Twitter yet, once they discover that their voice can be heard in the Universe, or they can interact with their idols in real time, they will become attached. Periscope is just a begging. When you read this, buyers should bid under $10 when market opens and end the struggle and disappointment, or Sellers should stop selling at Market Price and limit sell orders in $50s. Then forces will determine which way stock should move. Reason I think stock is worth under $10 today is that it was improperly valued from the start, company is losing money every quarter, showing modest growth, too much insider selling constantly decreases market cap. And $5, well that’s just a number, and 20% is my number.  ",0

I have been tracking Brazil and it just seems to continue to slip lower and lower with no bottom in sight.

* Finance minister sacked. New finance minister does not seem to be liked; Brazil equities went down and Real further weakened    

  
* Commodities are in a STRONG downtrend with no bottom in sight  
  
* Dollar should get a boost from Fed tightening cycle    
  
* Brazil was downgraded to junk status by both Moodys and S&amp;P    
  
* Biggest scandal in history of Brazil involving Petrobras still uncovering big politicians including heads of all political parties of current government!    
  
* Impeachment proceedings against President which is likely to drag for months if not years further making reforms/economic recovery more difficult.

Looking to invest a large portion of my capital with a more long term outlook in something low-risk but with decent returns. Also looking to play around with a much smaller portion with a more short-term mindset.  Open to learning a lot more and studying trading and investing since it sounds pretty interesting.

15-12-22,Oil,"I had lunch with a friend on Saturday. This is a guy I *always* listen to when he chooses to share his current market activities, as he got me into XM Satellite radio about 13 years ago when it was very cheap, and I ended up making a small fortune.

Anyway, he said that he's getting ready to make an oil play, and suggested that if the price of crude gets down to $25 a barrel, that I should sell the house, sell the car, sell the wife, sell the kids and put it all in oil-centric energy stocks. And he went on at great length about the details supporting his logic.

Interestingly, the very next day another friend said that he had seen essentially the same advice on Friday night on an investing show. Not as much detail as to why, but essentially the same sentiment.

So two questions...

First, is there a ""ticker symbol"", so to speak, for the price of crude? Or do I have to do a search on ""Brent crude"" whenever I want to find out the price?

Second, are there any funds that focus exclusively on oil, as opposed to energy in general? The few energy funds I've looked at seem to be too diverse to really catch a phenomenal ride should my friend's logic hold and the price of crude start an inexorable march to well above 100 sometime this spring.

I'm down on XVUS and VOO, and I'm slightly positive on VGHCX. Like $20 over. 0%, technically, as per SigFig. 


Someone in Personal Finance said to sell off my worst performing one, which would be VXUS. I have about 4k in it, 5k in VOO and 4.5k on VGHCX. 


Would this be the best thing to do? I also am looking to take another certification course for $500, so let's say my total expenses are $2k to round up (in reality it's less). So I'd have around  $2 or so depending on the fund I sell to rollover into my IRA.

2) I initially thought that you are paying the Open price when buying a stock, but I've been hearing about 'Ask' and 'Bid'. Ask is basically the lowest price you can buy a stock, and Bid is the highest selling amount. So when buying stock, are you usually just paying 'Ask' price?

3) Following Q#2, is an 'Ask' price usually available all day, or is it only available while the Market is open? (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM).

4) Following Q#2, How often does the 'Ask' price change during the day, or while the Market is open?

5) Following Q#2, What's the point of the 'Bid' price? If you have to pay more for the same thing as the 'Ask' price?

6) When checking if your stocks have increased or decreased the next time the market opens, would you be calculating the difference the previous 'Ask' price from the current Open price (If the market just opened) and the Closing price?

7) When selling, would it have to be while the Market is open? And how do you calculate how much you'd sell the stocks for?",4

Couldn't help but make me consider the timelessness of what the WSB community stands for. Even though drunkenly posting to this sub on Christmas eve, I swear to god I'm cool. 

Mr. Potter: ""George, I am an old man and most people hate me. But I don't like them either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan. You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it. Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it. You have been stopping me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing. Now take during the depression, for instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our heads. You saved the Building and Loan, I saved all the rest."" 

George Bailey: ""Yes, well, most people say you stole all the rest."" 

Mr. Potter: ""The envious ones say that, George. The suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now let's look at your side. A young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, married, making, say, forty a week."" 

George Bailey: ""Forty-five!"" 

Mr. Potter: ""Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother and paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or two comes along and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing fine.

Fell asleep praying that $RLYP would fill the gap,

SPY at  205.36 IV 16ish.

The reason for the trade is vol is still relatively high (16 range). The expected daily range for the SPY at this level is 0.7% to 0.8%. or move about 1.71+/-.  If you apply just a guide line STD, you have profit region that is about 34% chance of being profitable. 

With straddle cost of 0.76. that's about 0.35% so the just a rough  estimation of probability, you're at about 66% chance of success. 

There is also jobless claims event tomorrow, which may or may not affect the market.

15-12-25,CMP - DD,"**The Company -** Compass Mineral Material is a global producer of minerals for residential and commercial use.  They focus on providing salt, magnesium chloride, potash, and many other products. Additionally they have a $ 1.3 billion in revenue last year, and a net income of approx. $200 million. Compass Mineral works under the brand SIFTO,and Wolf Trax Inc.

**Products -** One of the main products that we will be focusing on for this particular trade is salt, particularly salt that is used for de-icing highways, roads, and practically anything that will be covered by ice or snow. Compass Mineral clients range from your basic average consumer to large cities. This is important, because according to their recent filing over **49% of their sales derive from salt**. Winter is basically one of their main drivers for their revenue due to highway de-icing. Compass Mineral has maintained theirs sales over the years between 300 million over the 4 month period from January to April. The fourth quarter, and the first quarter is their strongest period and most optimistic time, which has increased the price of the shares significantly in the past. The trading range for this 6 month period has always been 75 – 90 during this period due to the salt sales.

It is also good to note that on April 28th, 2014 (Release of First Quarterly Report) the share price jumped from 83.78 to 91.60 at the opening of market on April 30th, 2014, prior to the spike there was a run up to the 83.78.  Additionally there was a run up of the shares that occurred again this year in 2015, however due to the lower sales and milder winter the share prices did not significantly spike.

Below are the sales listed in millions for all Q1 report and the share price during the release of reports.

* 2015Q1 - $345.7 – ( $91.65 – April 28, 2015 ) / ( $89.09 – April 29, 2015 )
* 2014Q1 - $352.7 – ( $83.78 – April 28, 2014 ) / ( $91.60 – April 29, 2014 )
* 2013Q1 - $383.7 – ( $82.53 – April 29, 2013 ) / ( $86.54 – April 30, 2013 )
* 2012Q1 - $315.3 – ( $75.44 – April 26, 2012 ) / ( 75.46 – April 27, 2012 )

**Trade -** 

I will either be purchasing the CMP shares or buying the 80 Strike Call for June 2016. I am still figuring which is more comfortable for me as both trades have different risk and reward. Once I make my decision, I will purchase shares/contract and wait till they release the first quarterly report, or if the share price hit an early $85 I will exit immediately.

Price target - $85 - $90 (April 28, 2016)

**Risk –**

The most obvious risk for this trade is obviously, economic environment, interest rate risk (as noted on their SEC filing ) they have variable debt, Warmer Winter/ Less Snow Fall. The most major play for this trade is the weather, however it is good to note that management for Compass Mineral has lower forward guidance/expectation recently. I believe this has lowered the downside risk and the price of shares today reflects the lower guidance.

15-12-23,A recession in the American economy is predicted to happen in 2016. Where to invest to keep my money safe and my lost to a minimum atl least?,"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/122215/4-indicators-screaming-recession-2016.asp

Not the first time that I've heard alarming bells about a possible recession coming up next year. 

Where to invest in case the dollar plunges? Specially considering that I'm not American and, as a newbie, more than 50% of my assets is invested in US$ as a sort of hedge.

Is the overlooked gold an alternative? It's super cheap nowadays. Jim Rickards says it's really worth the shot for the next year as a hedge fund and, even though my impression of Rickards sometimes isn't much different from a thin-foiled-hatted paranoid, he has some argument. And gold is cheap nowadays.

To support the backend of fulfillment, the retailer recently acquired its own fleet of tractor-trailers and is also rumored to be renting an entire cargo airport facility in Wilmington, Ohio. Meanwhile, to support the front end, or last mile of fulfillment, Amazon has started making household deliveries in its own Amazon-branded trucks. The company is also engineering its own unmanned aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, with the intention of delivering packages.

All of these developments indicate that Amazon does not want to rely on third-party shippers like FedEx and UPS. As the country's largest online retailer, Amazon is a valuable customer to shippers, but expect that to change in 2016 as it begins handling a greater share of its own packages.",1
15-12-25,"Thoughts on XACT'S OBX ETF. (x-post from r/stocks)","My (elderly) mother wants to invest in stocks, but she's not very skilled at the technical side of things, so she gave me (her son) full control over her brooker account (nordnet.no). We got around 5000$ to our disposal.

I have been tradin stocks for quite some time. But i have mostly been investing in american stocks. This is because most of the stocks that reflect my interests, and knowledge, as a result, are tech stocks (and very few large tech stocks are norwegian).

However, my mom isn't too big of a fan of the stocks i'm the most knowledgeable about. This is, in part, because my mom, as you might have noticed, isn't too fond of technology. Her husband has also brought up the (semi-valid) point that the norwegian krone (NOK) is very weak at the moment, especially in comparison to the american dollar (USD), and our nordnet account has 40K NOK in it.
This led her to the conclusion, that any other stocks than OBX stocks are super volatile/risky.

This is a bit problematic, because i don't know that much about any major norwegian companies/stocks (exept the obvious ones, like Statoil, telenor ect). As a result i had to choose the most stable thing i could find, which led me to XACT'S Norwegian ETF.
We're not in too big of a hurry, and we have a pretty high risk-tolerance.

15-12-24,Types of funds in Roth IRA and 401k,"Hello, 

I'll be finishing my undergraduate studies in a few months and have a question before I start my full-time job and start investing my income. 

Age: 22 

Income: $63,000 

Debt: $3,500 student loans (will pay off immediately) 

Residing with my parents for a few years after graduation 

I am planning to create the basic three-fund portfolio (U.S. Stock Index, International Stock Index, and Bond Index) in my Roth IRA. I currently have invested $4,000 into VTSMX (Total Stock Market) in a Vanguard Roth IRA. I plan to max my contribution by April 2016 and continue to invest in the fund to obtain Admiral shares. I plan to invest in the international stock index and bond index several years in the future to balance the portfolio. 

Once I graduate, my employer will also provide a 6% match to a 401K. Of course, I will invest in the 401K before contributing to the Roth IRA, but I plan to max out the Roth IRA each year as well. 

I am wondering if it is best practice to have the same type of portfolio in a 401k and a Roth IRA. For instance, is it beneficial to have the three-fund portfolio in both accounts or would it be better to 'diversify' and have for example a value index in the 401k?",1

I have 4 credits in a finance class from college 2 years ago and A walk down wall street being delivered as we speak from AMZN. That being said, I'm mostly interested in going long on my investments and don't plan on actively trading stocks on the daily as it would be more work than I'd like to put into it. So far I am in BBRY and AMD for the long haul with hopes to get to the $13/$5 thresholds receptively. 

CPRX looks like it may have a lot of room for growth mid to late 2016 or early 2017. CPRX recently filed an NDA with the FDA for Firdapse, a drug for an ultra rare disease. If its granted it would allow them to get an exclusive product to market and generate cash flow by early 2017 with goals to boost their sales by 300 million. Their stocks are currently trading around $2.50 but I could see this stock becoming another Turing Pharma type company. 

Thoughts?

15-12-25,How do I Invest in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund While Living in Canada?,"Hi there,

I am a Canadian investor living in Alberta, Canada. I am interested in investing in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (I will call this the VG500). I recently invested in VOO (Vanguard's ETF that follows the S&amp;P 500). However, I am not quite happy with that choice, since I just found out that VOO does not reinvest dividends for you like the VG500 does (even though the VG500 expense ratio is 4x higher than VOO's). And since I have only invested about $5000 into VOO, the dividend yield will only produce about $200 every 2 years if it stays at the current yield and stock price. Therefore, paying $10 commission per trade, I will have to give up 5% of my investment in order to reinvest those dividends! (Since VOO is ~$200.00.) With that in mind, the VG500 seems like the better fund.

So, I would like to start investing in the VG500. But, since I am living in Canada, I am not quite sure if I can invest in it. Does anyone know if this is possible? And if so, how would I go about doing this?

Thank you.",8

15-12-24,What factors should,[deleted],1
15-12-25,Using leverage for ETF,"After a lot calculations with my strategy to use index funds I got the problem that with my current money income prediction the effect of the compound interest will be significantly when I am likely to old to make real use of it.

So my idea is to use  a leverage for index funds (ETFs). As they work both sides (+ and -) the main calculation point is the long term average.

Meaning that the long term average of approx 7.5% p.a. return is positive the effect of leverage will be positive as well.

For the negative side, the price will fall the x time factor as well - but this is already included in the average, meaning that any negative factor in the past 50years+ was fully absorbed in the following years.

What are your thoughts on this? In my calculation there is pretty much no scenario where the standard leverage of 1 is better than 2 or 3. I mean - all the people thinking about investing in Vanguard, the next logical step is to use a leverage, i cant be the first to think of it! Average is positive, so everything is said for a leverage - isnt it?

Ideal scenario would be some Vanguar product with leverage of 2 for the start and after some time 3 (dont want to loose all the money at the beginning), going back to 1 years before retiring as then I dont have years to wait until it recovers.",2

A full third of S &amp; P 500 sales and 40% of its profits are from outside the U.S.  We live in global economies that politicians pretend are local.  Pretending is bullshit.

Here's a 5 year dollar chart...

http://imgur.com/h5e3EI3

Increasing dollar value kills commodity prices, increasing dollar value kills exporter profit, increasing dollar value is a solid brick wall to large industrial share price gain.

This is the macro issue that matters.  CNBC and Jim Cramer and stocktwits aren't going to harp on this because it's boring.  But boring or not, it's reality.

The market needs inflation to post the 10-12% gains from markets past, it doesn't have it, it has deflation.  If you want longs find domestic companies that aren't subject to dollar price fluctuation.  A 20% rise in dollar value vs other currencies makes a 500 dollar iPhone cost 600 in China.  All of the corporate bullshit speak from Tim Cook and CNBC doesn't matter, numbers are numbers and if you want odds in your favor you don't contradict the numbers.  That's why people zero in on Google and Facebook and Netflix.  They have a small price-per-user product, mostly domestic, that doesn't give a shit about the value of the dollar.  

This is why pump and dump scams have been in biotech.  Health care is domestic and doesn't give a shit about currency fluctuation.  Give us 5% inflation and the same pump and dump scammers will be promoting a revolutionary new bulldozer manufacturer.

To summarize, some genius took an average daily expected move of the SPY given certain vix levels.

The conclusion I get from this, vix may have an effect on the daily expected % range. The average range is between 1.5-2.5%. So in a singular direction its about 0.75% to 1.25%.

Here is why the reverse IC with a 1.5-2.0 spread may be a good trade.

 1DTE RIC will cost between 0.75-0.80 depending on market conditions. But on average, you can expect this price range. This at current level of spy 205 area is a 0.35-0.4% move for B.E. This is about half of the average one move direction, which suggests a higher probability of success.

Things that may improve the success of this trade:

1) economic events happening the morning of or on the monday/tuesday
2) a vix of 16+. 
3) manage your losses. You can either take a max loss or partial loss. Depends on your risk profile.
4) you may also consider playing this trade on news of a dividend date.

If you played this every friday with an economic event happening, just based on the average % range, you probably have a good chance of success, since the average daily range even at a vix sub 12 averages 0.75%.

I currently follow the principles of [tax efficient allocation](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Principles_of_tax-efficient_fund_placement) so currently all my dividend shares go in my Roth and bonds and REITs go into my Trad 401k first then Roth. This means my brokerage account is focused on growth shares and international shares (mostly ETFs: VT, VOE, VEU). 
  
  
Amounts in each account are currently:  
  
Brokerage - $285K  
Lending Club - $28K  
Trad IRA - $140K  
Trad 401k - $35K  
Roth IRA - $60K  
Roth 401k - $25K  
Employer shares - $40K (to be sold off to buy ETFs over the next 6 months)  
  
Total - $613K   
Savings rate ~$100-150K per year
  
  
I plan to buy a house for around $400K in 3-5 years so I need that money accessible outside tax-exempt accounts. It seems risky to have it all in more volatile stocks. If there is a big market dip suddenly my accessible funds will go down and I may need to sell at the bottom.  
  
  
Should I be shifting my mix more to bonds in my brokerage account and not worrying about the fact they will be taxable? Should I go for Muni bonds or TIPS to reduce this?

15-12-26,Roth IRA investment,"With the new year around the corner I'm beginning to prepare for making my first 2016 IRA contributions. Each year, I try to maximize the contributions as early as possible. Some years I'm able to get the $5500 ready by January first, other years it takes me a bit longer.

 My question is: lets say I have $5500 in a brokerage non-tax advantaged account, and $5500 in a standard savings account, is there any difference between using the savings vs the brokerage in funding my IRA (Roth).

 I ask because each year, after I maximize my IRA I inevitably have some more money to invest, and always add it to a standard brokerage account rather than keep it in savings. Long term it seems better to have as much money in my Roth IRA as possible, but I don't know the short term consequences of liquidating another account to fund it. Is this done commonly, or even recommended? Would it be better (easier) to do this within the same brokerage company?",22
15-12-24,Short $BONT,"So here is a stock I've just noticed on my screener, [$BONT](http://imgur.com/BaTluBX)

This company has basically been going down the shitter for the duration of this year losing around 75% of its value so far on a really solid downtrend as shown in the chart above.

Looking at the fundamentals, debt is going up, book value is negative, book value per share is -$1. There was a little bump in the stock price around black friday/cyber monday but that has more or less fizzled out. 

Looking at that chart, it is sitting right on its support and resistance meaning that it has to decide which one it will follow. My guess? It goes down on the same trajectory it has been all year, breaking through the relatively new (a possible black friday induced) resistance.

15-12-24,"Give me some thoughts on XACT'S(OBX) ETF.","My (elderly) mother wants to invest in stocks, but she's not very skilled at the technical side of things, so she gave me (her son) full control over her brooker account (nordnet.no). We got around 5000$ to our disposal. 

I have been tradin stocks for quite some time. But i have mostly been investing in american stocks. This is because most of the stocks that reflect my interests, and knowledge, as a result, are tech stocks (and very few large tech stocks are norwegian).

However, my mom isn't too big of a fan of the stocks i'm the most knowledgeable about. This is, in part, because my mom, as you might have noticed, isn't too fond of technology. Her husband has also brought up the (semi-valid) point that the norwegian krone (NOK) is very weak at the moment, especially in comparison to the american dollar (USD), and our nordnet account has 40K NOK in it.

This led her to the conclusion, that any other stocks than OBX stocks are super volatile/risky. 

This is a bit problematic, because i don't know that much about any major norwegian companies/stocks (exept the obvious ones, like Statoil, telenor ect). As a result i had to choose the most stable thing i could find, which led me to XACT'S Norwegian ETF.

We're not in too big of a hurry, and we have a pretty high risk-tolerance.

Please share your thoughts! Anything is useful, even if it does not lead to a defenite conclusion. Sorry for my spelling errors btw, i use less english daily than you'd expect, but my text should be understandable, even if my sentence structure is a bit wierd.",0

Since then I've made a few changes to my company sponsored 401k plan (including increasing my contribution from 8% to 10%; wish we could do more since our company matches up to 50%  but can't) as far as what I was investing on and also opened a Roth IRA account with Vanguard. I was curious on what the more experienced investors would suggest investing on for next year, primarily focusing on long term investing.

I should mention that our 401k company (MassMutual) has a very limited number of mutual funds so although I'm limited on selections, they do offer at least one mutual fund in every fund category (value, growth, small, mid, etc) for both US and global markets. I am 30 years away from retirement and my wife has 35 to go (she contributes 8%); I manage both of our 401k accounts and we both work for the same company. Currently both of our accounts are very diversified with approximately 85% stocks -~25% between global and emerging markets- and the rest in bonds.

15-12-26,"GoPro: Speculative Buy, But Huge Rewards","Ahh! GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO). A stock that gravity took over. It crushed from $98.47 (early October 2014) all the way down to $15.90 (mid December 2015). Boy, was Citron Research right, when they predicted share-price would drop to $30 within a year, in November of the last year.

And what now? Is this end of GoPro or is there more?

As for me, I’m very skeptical of the market. I’m someone who loves to go against the investments of the crowd.

For example, when the Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) was launched, I was convinced that the market was hyped about it and I didn’t find any intrinsic value in BABA’s share price. Recent market sentiment about GoPro is SELL SELL SELL!!! Me being the skeptic, I say BUY BUY BUY!!!

And it’s not just because of my skepticism of the market, but because of Karma and more.

Karma is coming in 2016 for the short-sellers of GPRO. So take your profit while you can. GoPro has planned to launch its first drone, Karma in 2016. The introduction of a drone will expand camera maker’s product line, beyond making action cameras.

The release of Karma is released, will launch GoPro into Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV) market. The Smart Commercial Drones Market is expected to reach $27.1 billion by 2021 from $3.4 billion in 2014, according Wintergreen Research, Inc’s report, “Smart Commercial Drones: Market Shares, Market Strategies, and Market Forecasts, 2015 to 2021.” According to the report, “The commercial grade consumer video drone segment is the largest one in terms of revenue in 2015, and it is expected to lead over the forecast period.”

GoPro founder and CEO Nick Woodman said at the TechCrunch conference in September that the company is planning to launch a drone in the first half of 2016, “development is on track for the first half of 2016. We have some differentiations that are right in the GoPro alley.” Karma is finally coming.

Hollywood is eager to change the way they take aerial shots. Not long ago, they used helicopters (some still do) to shoot from bird’s point-of-view and it costs a lot. Drone makes it all cheaper. Not only cheaper, but also safer and opens more creative ways of shooting a video. In other words, drones can do what helicopters cannot do.

On May 28, GoPro announced at Google’s I/O conference that it will build a 360-degree camera array for stereoscopic spherical videos. With the help of Google Jump, Google’s virtual reality system,  GoPro’s camera array, Odyssey can make videos like this. I believe the Odyssey can be very useful for real estate market. “360-Degree Real Estate Tour – Brought to you by GoPro.”

Oh, did I mention Odyssey has 16 cameras that work together as one? I repeat, 16. Hey GoPro, why don’t you knock out your useless and wasteful $300 million buyback program out of the park? According to its third-quarter SEC filing (10-Q), GoPro stated,

“To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all.”
They spend 345x more on buybacks than they do on research and development. So GoPro, eliminate your worthless buyback program. “Customize” the money into research and development, and acquisitions. Customize the Odyssey. 16 cameras? Really? Reduce the size and improve the quality.

I strongly believe GoPro should acquire a small thermal imaging company. Thermal imaging can be a perfect fit for drones. I suggest GoPro acquires Seek Thermal, designer and manufacturer of high quality thermal imaging products. If GoPro acquires Seek Thermal or a different thermal imaging tech company, they will be able to reach sectors such as firefighting and agriculture. Diversified!

Partnership with Rollei – a German manufacturer of optical instruments and a seller of GoPro compatible accessories – might be helpful.

Another great acquisition can be Vuzix (NASDAQ: VUZI), a Google Glass rival, and a leading developer and supplier of smart glasses and video eyewear products in the consumer enterprise and industrial markets. Vuzix holds over 41 patents and 10 additional patents pending. Market cap. is currently $104.39 million. With $513 million cash on hand, GoPro can afford the acquisition. In January, Vuzix received a $24.8 million investment from Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). Intel bought preferred stock that is convertible into common shares equivalent to 30% of Vuzix.

In the third-quarter, GoPro’s revenue increased 43% year-over-year (Y/Y) to $400.3 million. On non-GAAP basis, its net income, operating income, and operating expenses increased 103.9% Y/Y, 71.7% Y/Y, and 44.3% Y/Y, respectively. On GAAP basis, it increased 28.58%, 105.36%, and 43.78%, respectively. The growth isn’t bad for a company with a market cap. of $2.49 billion. However, its inventory days increased 80.6% Y/Y from 67.7 to 122.3.

There are buyout rumors and one of the potential suitors being Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). While this is a great news, it is not likely to happen in the first half of 2016. I believe the management of GoPro would not want to sell the company until they see the outcome of Karma. If the outcome is positive, the company will not be sold next year. If it is negative, the company will be sold unless they have something up in their sleeves. Management’s actions should a sign of what’s to come.

I’m confident the founder of GoPro will turn things around next year. GoPro can be a leader in its field if it eliminates the buyback program and invests into the future. According to Futuresource Consulting, the global action camera market grew by 44% Y/Y in 2014. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.2% between 2014 and 2019. GoPro should target not only sport enthusiasts, but the film and television industry, real estate, and other sectors such as, firefighting and agriculture. In order to do that, GoPro should first create a product that suits the sector’s needs. First impressions are important.

15-12-27,What do you guys think about $PKOH?,"Does anyone have an opinion on Park-Ohio Holdings Corporation? One of the more fundamentally sound companies I've seen in a while, yet doesn't garner a lot of attention. The company consistently posts at least $30M in free cash and has comfortable earnings growth. Some of the downsides I see are high debt-levels (which I don't necessarily consider problematic as management has chosen to finance almost entirely with debt) and, more glaringly, extremely low margins. Despite these margins, I really like where this company is financially and I think shares look extremely cheap at $36.67, I see at least a 30% upside here. Thoughts?",0

I'm not sure how much interest there is in the investment community in the linear program styled portfolio optimization. But here is the code base for one of my recent projects, where I try to replace the variance based risk constraint, which is a non-linear second order condition, with a linear constraint on the entropies, which would aggregate to give the portfolio entropy.

15-12-27,Fundamental Basis of Cash Flow/Earnings-Based Valuation Models,"I have been investing (generally successfully) in stocks for some time and have based my investments around operating or free cash flow (or earnings I adjust based on analysis). I generally just dove into the work and did it, I never stopped to think about the premise. 

I am having a bit of trouble finding (or thinking of) a strong, logical argument for earnings/cf based analyses. The problem I see is as follows:

No matter what earnings power, short or long term, a company has, if they do not pay a dividend I have no access to said earnings and thus the value of the company should be minimal to me as a small investor (without ability to control any actions of the company). 

Can someone help me understand where the flaw in my logic is/why cash flow analysis is useful?

EDIT: I don't think I explained my question as well as I could have. Clearly there are a number of ways for companies to ""return cash"" to shareholders. However, all, save dividends, affect the share price by lowering the per share price to future per share earnings/cash flow. I don't see how, from a logical standpoint (not an empirical one) the cash flow of a company should help or hurt an investor since you have no way of tapping it. If the cash flow doesn't help/hurt then no changes to that ratio should help the investor. ",27

15-12-27,My Personal 2016 Macro Investing Guide,"Key Macro Trends:

Low Commodity Prices
US Presidential Elections
Rising Interest Rates

So for the first issue of low commodity prices it seems pretty obvious that now may one of the best times in recent memory to invest in energy due to the nature of the pricing environment. Don't really see a high probability of prices dramatically falling again so I think it'd be wise to put a fair percentage of one's portfolio into energy stocks with moderate yields, but high security (think XOM). You can get a few cheap blue chips with extraordinary yields that will most certainly make a a buyer a small fortune in the incoming years regardless of if prices turn around or not. 

Second of where things get a bit more interesting. The nature of any election is uncertainty, but that does us no good if we're dealing with stocks alone. So for the election I'm thinking we look into options on stocks that will be dramatically affected by the outcome. I'm looking to make a few straddles to play the upcoming volatility regarding three major issues in the election: 

1) Healthcare: GOP Candidate likely to try and Repeal ACA 
2) Defense: Obvious party divide behind military funding
3) Gun Control: Increased media coverage on these shootings have pressed the issue to become a topic of hot discussion in the upcoming election once the primary's are 
over. 

Hoping I can get Jan 17 straddles on some major pharma players (Johnson &amp; Johnson, Phizer, etc.) major defense contractors, (Boeing, Lockheed and Raytheon), and lastly gun stocks (Stern, Smith &amp; Wesson, Ruger). 

Lastly I'm going to long bank stocks in benefit to rising interest rates. I feel like the long period of ZIRP, and tight monetary regulation is finally loosening up as we begin to see the nation begin to forget about 2008. Hopefully this can allow commercial banking to make much higher profits from loans and help the investment banks begin to increase opportunities as investors pressure the exuberant amount of startups created during ZIRP to go public in hopes of liquidating their investments and meeting the required WACC needed. 

Any other ideas/macro events and plays upon them would be helpful as I'm looking to set up my 2016 portfolio. Also any feedback on the ideas I have is much appreciated.



TL;DR: 
2016 Investment Strategy:  Long Energy stocks, Straddle Defense Healthcare and Gun stocks, long bank stocks.

15-12-27,Opinions on best small-cap value ETFs?,"Hi all, 

I'm looking at small cap value ETFs to hold for the long term, as both small caps and value stocks tend to outperform over the long term. I'd love some insight into which ETFs you think are best and why.  Here are my initial thoughts:


VBR- a classic Vanguard ETF with low fees, high AUM, high liquidity, and good overall features. However, it turns out that the index it tracks ends up on the high end of the range, with a large portion of the assets in mid caps or very large small caps. I'm worried this could limit the growth (though, of course, there are advantages to having mid caps anyway) 


SLYV, IJS - Lean much more to the smaller end, with most of the funds in small and micro caps. IJS has good liquidity but high fees, while SLYV has better fees but also moderately lower liquidity. 


VTWV- I haven't looked into this one very much, but I saw it recommended after some casual googling. The fees and very low AUM threw me off before I even got into looking at its holdings, but is there a reason I should take a second look? 


So, any thoughts on these based on further analysis? I've looked into their P/Es, average market caps, and industry breakdowns, but haven't really seen anything that hugely stood out aside from those mentioned above. ",3

15-12-27,Is MHG a good buy atm?,,4
15-12-27,Anyone think Apple should buy Blackberry?,"I think if Apple actually considers buying blackberry, it could make apple an even bigger power house.

The purchase would be about 1-2% of Apples market cap, so at this price its levels it seems like a good investment. 

In exchange for this 1-2%, they will likely control the entire business and government market, which I'm sure is much bigger than the 1-2% they are spending. 

Think about the product capabilities also. Most people like blackberry for its keyboard and hardware. The only thing lacking are the apps. 

If apple makes a phone using a combination of Blackberry's QNX and keyboard combo with the IOS. Apple's now acquired the market who is strictly into the keyboards.  Blackberry's security features are also in line with apple's desire to maintain quality apps and products. 

So, the real question is, what is a probable and reasonable price for blackberry to be picked up at? 

Analysis points:
1) John Chen starts at nov 2013, market share price approximately $7-$8.
2) John Chen is entitled to 13 Million Restricted shares over a 5 year contract. 25% 3rd and 4th year, remainder end 5th year.
3) End of contract is Nov 2018
4) When does John Chen Expect to retire? 

1) If John Chen currently has no shares so a buyout is not likely, since he has nothing to gain.While A buy out at 20-30% premium would look good on John Chen's resume and to current shareholders on the basis that the company's share price has grown approx 40-50%, he doesn't really gain as much as he would, if he had shares. 

2) John Chen's share breakdown is probably the following:
3rd year 3.25M  november 2016
4th year 3.25M november 2017
5th year 6.50M november 2018

These are restricted shares, so a fair price is likely to be at market price. 

3) At the end of Nov 18, he will be around 63 years old, near retirement and be near the end of his contract. At this age, I don't think he'd make a good candidate for CEO of other companies due to his age. 

4) I think it's reasonable to assume he'd retire between the age of 63-65 provided he's accumulated the networth he wants to maintain his current life style. At the end of the contract, lets project what he might acquire shares at. 

3.25M Nov 2016 -  $8-$10
I think an range of $8-$10 per share is reasonable. MKT cap of BBRY will still be between 4.5-5B, still a solid value buyout price, considering it is now profitable. 

3.25M Nov 2017 - $8- $10
Lets assume the same range, considering there isn't any growth expected for blackberry, other than maintaining.

6.50M Nov 2018 - ? 

With this, If John chen Sold out at the end of 2016 or 2017 initiated a buyout from some leading tech companies, the max premium would be 50%, however a more likely premium is 20%. So, if  the price hovers between $8-10, a buyout of at max $15 per share mkt cap of 7.5Bish would net john chen the following if he sold out:
using a 20-50% premium on average share price $9.5

2016 - approx 36M-48M
2017 - approx 36-48M
2018 - 70M to 93M

-All of these are pretty attractive and will both look good on John Chen's i.e increased value of BBRY by approx 50-100% with the buyout. 
- Not sure if he'd hold out until 2018 if he could find a buyer at the end of 2016, considering his payout. 

So, my assessment for this is BUY BBRY at current prices because:

-his goal will probably be to maintain current price levels of $8-10 
-Then he will look to be bought out for 20-30% premium off of the current price. 

Why its in his best interest to maintain current prices after receiving shares? 
- company will show positive growth from when he started
- will receive good compensation package 
- will not be liable to lawsuits
- reputation will be in good standing, and thus still employable, if he wanted it. 

IF not:
1) It will look like he did not have investors interest in mind
2) If he sold his shares, it will look like his motive was to acquire shares and then retire.
3) he could face lawsuits. 
4) Will be the CEO that sold out a company at a loss.

I'm hoping you guys can help me understand what my best option is for investing with my employers 401k.  Since I left college (about 8 years ago) I had been using the Fidelity Target account for 2050.  After reading this forum and personal finance and finally starting to understand investing a little bit more I dug into it and realized that this fund does not seem to be a great option. (High fees, sub par returns, and some questionable funds that seem to benefit Fidelity more than me). 

That leads me into the strange and scary world of picking my own fund and overriding the default selection.  I know reddit as a whole is a big fan of index funds, the only one I can see that is available is:
Columbia Mid Cap Index Fund Class A

However the fund with the highest Morningstar rating is:

Victory Sycamore Small Company Opportunity Fund Class R

The fee for the Victory fund is 1.58 which is even higher then the Fidelity 2050 fund. The fee for the index is .66.

How does one determine what is the better option?

That probably sounds like a mumbo-jumbo to you, so let's put it in simple terms. This means Comcast has figured out how to use its existing cable lines to deliver super-fast gigabit internet speeds without having to do major work on its current infrastructure. 

Gigabit internet is broadband that delivers download speeds of 1,000 megabits per second (Mbps) or better. That's at least 10 times faster than what you get today from your cable modem.

Usually, gigabit internet requires internet providers to install new fiber lines in the cities they serve. It's an expensive, lengthy process, and cable companies aren't always incentivized to invest that much in the technology.

But Comcast's technology appears to be more promising since a lot of the upgrades can be done with software enhancements to its existing infrastructure. It also means Comcast will be able to offer gigabit internet to its customers a lot sooner than other cable companies can.

Comcast says it'll start testing the new technology in more homes in 2016 and expand from there.

15-12-28,A Back-of-the-Envelope Calculation of Leveraged ETF returns From 2005 to 2015.,"Lately, there has been a fair share of threads on leveraged ETF. Intuitively, it sounds like a great idea: there is a positive risk premium associated with investing, causing stocks – on average – to trend up over the long run. Adding leverage should complement this effect. 

Leveraged ETFs like [SPXL]( http://www.direxioninvestments.com/products/direxion-daily-sp-500-bull-3x-etf) are created with the goal of replicating 3x (300%) the returns of the S&amp;P 500 *for a single day*. Yet, when [looking at the charts](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=SPXL+Interactive#symbol=SPXL;range=my), one can’t help getting a warm, fuzzy feeling as you can clearly see SPXL trending from $15.42 (Nov 3, 2008) to $84.98 (Dec 28, 2015) (**+451.22%**). Not too shabby compared to SPY (**+118.93%**). 

An inherent risk to leveraged ETFs is the so-called leverage decay. As the fund manager ‘resets’ the ETF on a daily basis, leverage is added as the index trends up, while leverage is decreased as the index trends down. Basically, the fund exposes you to the fallacy of ‘buy high, sell low’ – or at least, that is the thought behind it. However, since the index tends to trend up. The main question we should be asking ourselves is: is the decay *stronger* than the generally assumed upward trajectory of stocks?

---

**A Brief Background on Leverage ETFs**

It wasn’t until March 2008 that the Securities and Exchange Commission began to authorize the creation of actively managed ETFs. It didn’t take too long before leveraged ETFs sprung into existence. The fund managers of these ETFs typically enter into total return swaps with institutional counterparties, allowing them to replicate a magnified movement of the underlying index (often x2 or x3).

---

**Leverage Decay: a Real Problem?**

To give an illustration of how leverage decay works, imagine the S&amp;P going up 1% on day one, and going down 1% in the subsequent day. 



% Change | S&amp;P 500 | S&amp;P 500 x3
---|---|----|----
Starting cash: | $10,000 | $10,000 | 
+1% | +$100 | +$300 |
 | $10,100 | $10,300 | 
-1% | -$101 | -309
 | $9,999 | $9,991

Imagine the S&amp;P wobbling up and down roughly 220 days per year, and you get a pretty good mental image of how the leverage decay is supposed to destroy your returns.

But then; why doesn’t it show?

To test whether the upward trend cancels out the leverage decay, I used data from the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/SP500/downloaddata). Starting date Dec 5, 2012, up to the present day (Dec 28, 2015). On the basis of the S&amp;P points, I calculated the daily change. Using this change, I calculated 3 different scenarios:

- 1: **S&amp;P 500** 
- 2: **S&amp;P 500 x3**. Using ‘traditional’ leverage. That is, assuming one has $10,000 in cash, a $20,000 loan. His net worth is still $10,000, but his returns are amplified by 3.
- 3: **S&amp;P 500 x3 ETF**

---

**Limitations**

- The dataset is not complete. Over the course of 10 years, data for 89 days was incomplete. Results may therefore slightly diverge. Especially when bearing in mind that the additional data points are important to measure the leverage decay.
- Dividends are not included. This works in favour of leveraged ETFs; e.g. SPY pays dividend, and most leveraged ETFs don’t pay dividend. Some have during their early days, but since it is nowadays common practice to enter into total return swaps, dividends are generally not collected. 
- The calculations do not include fees, which are generally higher for leveraged ETFs.
- I do not and cannot guarantee my soberness while running the data.

---

**Test 1: Leverage Decay During a Crisis**

As noted before, leveraged ETFs have been here only since the crisis. Looking at SPXL, you are looking at a leveraged ETF which has never seen the concept of a financial crisis. With my data starting in 2005, you can see that the crisis puts a [serious drag](http://i.imgur.com/2FT5okN.png) on the results:

In 10 years, the S&amp;P 500 returned 64.02%, excluding dividends. If you were to have a interest-free loan, you would have had quite a scary 2008 as your net worth dipped quite far below $0. If you wouldn't have pulled out, you would have a 192.06% return after 10 years. That is, once again, excluding dividends. Employing 3x leverage, only the dividend yield would have been appealing. 

On the other hand, the leveraged ETF gets crushed during the crisis. After that, it hardly manages to break even. 19.02% in 10 years is not something be proud of.

---

**Test 2: Assuming a 6% Loan**

Naturally, other people’s money generally doesn’t come for free. That is, if you do not have the opportunity to take out interest free loans like many European students do. Assuming you would invest a 6% loan in the S&amp;P 500, and assuming that you would have to pay the 6% on an annual basis, [your returns would look different](http://i.imgur.com/ivDgmlB.png). 

**Limitation**: Once again, dividends are not factored in. If you would have a 2:1 leverage ratio, probably the dividend payout could easily cover the interest expenses. 

In this scenario, I subtracted $1,200 ($20,000 loan x 0.06) on an annual basis. Y1 $1,200, Y2 $2,400, etc. 

This time, you were significantly tested during the 2008 financial crisis. You would still have come out ahead pretty far. Especially if dividends would have been factored in. 

---

**Test 3: 2009-2015**

Naturally, looking at the past 6 years, coming straight out of a major bull market, results will look different. [I like this chart](http://i.imgur.com/qjr56nb.png) because it shows something that a Yahoo Finance comparison of SPY and SPXL does not show. In times of volatility like Aug 2015, SPXL gets crushed. This makes sense as the 3x leverage works both ways. What is also curious is how poorly the 3x ETF tracks the *real* leverage (using an interest-free loan, in this case). In 2013, the 3x ETF starts outperforming the traditional leverage (again, set aside dividends), but it does so in a much more volatile and unpredictable way. 

Moreover, it also appears that the 3x ETF goes down harder relative to the traditional leverage.

---

**To Conclude**

Looking at leveraged ETF charts, leverage decay does not look like a real issue. In fact, in a major bull market, a leveraged ETF can outperform even traditional 3x leverage using borrowed money, as the leveraged ETF keeps ‘doubling up’, continuously increasing its exposure to the underlying index. As long as you are in bull market territory, this is *awesome*. 

Yet, you forego dividends, and if another major recession or crash happens, you may never see your initial investment go back to where it was. If you want to lever up, traditional leverage makes more sense. 

**Disclaimer: This is, of course, no recommendation use leverage. Nor should the foregoing be used to make any investment decision, as I made these calculations solely to see the effects on a market downturn on a leveraged ETF - in a very simplified manner. Yadayada, always do your own DD.**",39
15-12-28,[Q] VW Stock?,"Hello,
I'm 19 years old and really new to investments and all, I actually never invested in the real stock market.
What got me really fixed though, was the marked ""crash"" of VW when the ""scandal"" came out.
I always thought those are the best opportunities to buy in, especially since I was sure VW will get back up, since it's a big and stable company.
I asked my father and the internet, but everybody told me, it is way too risky, and the price will go even lower when the price ""VW"" has to pay, comes out.

So I did wait and just watched.
Now I saw, VW is already going back on track, lowest points were reached and are over.
So I guess I screwed up?
Do people really say it's too risky and not a lot people were going for this opportunity?
I am as I said new, so maybe I am overlooking something.. but it seems so weird to me.

About 0.6% higher than the original count. Could be just rounding errors. This is not a significant amount anyway. 

* Outcomes:
If you bet 1154 times @$75; total cost is $86550.

* 768 x $75(lose 100%, may be able to reduce if managed properly)
=-$57,600

* 141 x $12 (this is a low average for moves of 0.45%  but less than 1%)
=+$1762

* 253 x $150 (you'd double up basically) 
=+$34,050

All this for a combined loss of -$21,788! You would have lost 24% of your portfolio over the last 22 years!


The good news for the future is..  IF you had done the reverse of this, you would have netted about $10,000- 11,000! Sounds like a lot huh? 
Nope, its about 0.5% a year averaged over the 22 year period. Barely enough to keep up with inflation.

* KBIO is already delisted, despite the fact that Nasdaq plans to delist it on the 30th.
* Martin Shkreli is worth $750 or whatever shit, except that the SEC allegation is that his hedge fund had that much in the bank account.
* People defaulting on student debt en masse will cause a bubble to burst, despite the fact that it's impossible to discharge student debt in a bankruptcy.
* It's possible to interchangeably use ""it's"" and ""its"" (and similar contractions) because grammar is just an inconvenience to writing. JUST DON'T WRITE!
* Shkreli ""price gouged"" patients, instead of insurance companies -- (except that isn't the case, and...) virtually every pharma in existence today was doing the exact same thing.
* That ([and other things](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3xvzm8/turns_out_martin_shkreli_was_telling_investors_he/cy9e5j2)) also makes Shkrelli an asshole, whereas taking out almost [$50m in compensation as CEO of another far bigger price-gouging company](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3y339h/walt_disney_chairman_and_ceo_bob_iger_saw_his/) makes you a saint.
* Shkreli is the modern-day Bernie Madoff, despite never having run an actual ponzi scheme or losing hundreds (?) of billions of dollars for investors.
* $35 a barrel is the absolute minimum oil prices can go to, despite there being no such law.
* KBIO is now worthless, despite it not being worthless.
* Comcast just made its old lines magnitudes faster [just with a software upgrade](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/3yem32/comcast_just_had_a_major_breakthrough_that_could/), except for the part where it's not just Comcast and [it's not just a software upgrade](http://corporate.comcast.com/comcast-voices/worlds-first-live-docsis-3-1-gigabit-class-modem-goes-online-in-philadelphia) -- the relatively new and expensive infrastructure was just inefficient to begin with.

15-12-29,Dubai Holding for long-term investments,"Dubai Holding, a government-owned international investment group, is targeting long-term investments worldwide in its push to maximize revenue for the emirate and diversify its income sources, a senior company executive has said.

Ahmad bin Byat, Vice Chairman and Managing Director, said Dubai Holding controls investments in many countries, including Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Malta, India and Greece, adding that it always strives to “take the right decision at the right time.”

He said: “We target strategic projects with long-term investment as the group’s policy is not based on quick profits…we focus on added-value projects that are compatible with the emirate’s policies and will diversity its economy.”

“Our investments abroad are diversified and they cover many countries. In India, our investments are progressing well while we are pursuing our investment drive in Malta, where we have signed a partnership with the government to build a Smart City based on the innovation complexes we have here in Dubai,” he added.
Byat, who was speaking at a meeting organized by the Dubai Government's Media Office, said nearly 60 per cent of Dubai Holding’s revenues are fixed, adding that it owns around 25,000 rented housing units as well as 11 innovation and creative complexes employing in excess of 72,000 people.

He said Dubai Holding’s planned Mall of the World is progressing as per schedule, describing it as a “giant, integrated tourism project.”
He said it would give a strong push to the tourism sector in Dubai, which attracted more than 13 million visitors last year.
“This underscores Dubai’s important position…the city is now the fourth tourism destination in the world after London, Paris and Bangkok in terms of the number of tourists relative to the population. Dubai is focusing on the future and it is helped by its flexible economy,” he said.

Byat said Dubai Holding, one of the region’s largest groups, is investing nearly Dh4.5 billion in innovation and infrastructure projects as part of its efforts to diversify sources of income and support the UAE economy.
Byat, also chairman of Du, said the UAE is seeking to become a world communication and information exchange center.

“The UAE already has one of the strongest telecommunication sectors in the world, with growth in this sector reaching 35 per cent last year. The UAE also has the highest smartphone penetration rate, which stands at nearly 100 per cent,” he said.

15-12-28,Earnings after commission and taxes.,"I limit my stocks to 20% gains.  I should have limited my energy stocks last month to 10% loss but that is yet another expensive lesson learned.  In order to make sure the gains are a true 20% in my pocket I factor in commission and tax.  Someone please tell me if I am right. 

For example I buy 1,000 shares of EX at $0.5 asking price.  That is $500. First I factor in my initial 20%.  

$500 * 1.20 = $600.

Then I add commission.  

$600 + 19.98 = $619.98

If I would sell, all profit counts as income, including what I pay for commission, and is taxed at 25%.  

$619.98 - $500 = $119.98  

$119.98 * 1.25 = 149.975

Then I add the total I need to gain and divide by number of shares to determine end sale price for true 20% gains.

$500 + $149.975 = $649.98

$649.98 / 1,000 = 0.65

Limit sell to $0.65 for true 20% gain. That is a 30% increase for 20% yield. FYI.",10

15-12-28,Hanwha Q CELLS: A Hidden Gem Within The Solar Industry,"&gt; Why HQCL deserves a look

&gt; 1) Recent quarter performance was good driven by operational efficiencies and higher revenues - Revenues rose over 26% on a quarterly basis to $427 million in Q3 '15. Revenues from downstream business is also increasing. Shipment volumes increased by 31% sequentially to 805 MW, while gross margin increased to 21.8%. The internal manufacturing cost declined to $0.39 per watt by the end of Q3, compared to a $0.425 per watt in Q2 '15. This makes HQCL one of the lowest cost producers in the world with one of the highest margins. Hanwha Q CELLS further targets to reduce costs to 10% opex/revenue by the end of the year, from 12.3% currently (and 17% level from Q2).

&gt; 2) Capacity Expansion - Hanwha Q CELLS has plans to achieve a manufacturing capacity of 4.3 GW each for cells and modules. The company is expanding in Malaysia and Korea and has plans to expand capacity through 2015 and 2016. The Malaysian facility will cater to high efficiency product technology while Korea will enable duty free shipments to USA. Given its diverse international footprint, the company is in a unique position to flexibly address the global markets.

&gt; Hanwha Q CELLS has a higher cell production capacity when compared to Trina Solar (NYSE:TSL), which will have an estimated capacity of 3.5 GW and 4.8 GW, respectively, by 2015 and 2016 end. The company also has plans to build a new production facility in Thailand.

&gt; 3) New Deals - The company signed a module supply agreement over 1.5 GW with NextEra (NYSE:NEE), the industry's largest ever, according to Bloomberg. Hanwha Q CELLS also signed a supply deal with USA's top residential installer Sunrun (NASDAQ:RUN) becoming one of its main suppliers in the next year, providing up to 135 MW of modules. In addition to the above, Hanwha Q CELLS was also chosen by SunEnergy1 as the sole module supplier for its project portfolio in North Carolina.

&gt; 4) Increasing downstream business - Majority of mainstream Chinese manufacturing companies have diversified into the more profitable solar development segment. Hanwha Q CELLS has also been successful in achieving a decent geographical diversification across its downstream project business. The downstream project pipeline exceeds 1.2 GW this year.

&gt;  5) Robust Outlook - Hanwha Q CELLS gave a good outlook, with gross margins expected at more than 20% for Q4 '15. The company expects to incur $280 million as capital expenses for cell and module capacity expansion and technological upgrades. The USA will be the biggest market in 2016 followed by Japan with a growing presence in India and Turkey.

&gt; a) Falling ASP - The average selling price of external shipments declined by $0.02 to reach 57 cents per watt during the third quarter. Although the company has a decent presence in the US markets, its overall ASP is affected due to shipments to low ASP regions like China and India. Revenues from China increased to 12% in Q3 '15 from 8% in the previous quarter.

&gt; b) Increasing debt - Total term borrowings increased by ~$60 million to $517 million. Although HQCL does not face any funding pressures due to its strong parentage (part of the Hanwha conglomerate), it needs to watch debt closely as it has been the cause of downfall for major solar companies.

&gt; Valuation low, despite stock outperformance

&gt; In my view, a company with such potential deserves better valuation and I think prices will go up, given the expected earnings growth. The stock is currently trading at ~$28 level, almost equal to its 52-week high price. The market capitalization value stands at $2.23 billion and the stock looks very cheap with a forward P/E of just ~3x.

&gt; Conclusion

&gt; Although the company received a boost in net income because of a reversal of arbitration accruals related to the acquisition of Q CELLS, the results were also driven by a favorable mix achieved due to improvement in operations and reduction in in-house costs. Hanwha Q CELLS has benefited from the Q CELLS acquisition, leading to rapid capacity expansion and strengthening module sales backlog. Its downstream business is also growing, with the company having grid-connected over 50 MW of projects till date. The company is witnessing some upward earnings estimate revision by analysts. HQCL is a hidden gem of the solar industry. However, the solar sector is incredibly volatile and only for investors with a high risk tolerance. The stock valuation looks cheap and I would recommend buying on dips.

15-12-28,Less diversification = more gains?,"I have been thinking a lot recently, and  think I have come up with an idea that can yield infinite gains.

Assumptions:

1. Diversification of your stock portfolio leads to less yield. People who buy Etfs and shifty Vanguard funds make almost zero ROI. This is because they don't yolo and dont have balls at all. 

2. However, if you don't diversify, and all in stocks like KBOI you get massive gains.

Principle:

This means that if you diversify even less you get more gains. 

Most people I see own around 1 type shares. This is ofcourse way better than owning shares in, like, 100 different companies. But this approach is far from perfect. We need to diversify even less.

We need to make diversification (amount of different types of shares in different companies you own) equal zero. This should in theory make your gains equal infinity aswell ( 1/0 = infinity, this is the difference between normal diversification and optimal diversification; then you just multiply your gains with infinity, and you'll have infinite gains(or you'll go bankrupt))

How would I go on to implement this strategy?

AVXL has trended down for the last five days. A lot of the movement recently has seemed to have happened on no news or rumors. Could anyone provide some light on this type of movement?

BGMD has declined do to issues with their approval. Have we seen the bottom of this or is this another AMDA?

Some stocks like YouGov however really mess up the bot as it sees them rise very quickly at the start of the day and then never has the opportunity to sell because it never 'catches' the opportunity to sell the stocks before they drop.

We're using google finance to track YouGov but do they maybe have their own feed or something like that? Maybe an exclusive deal with bloomberg or something that means the second by second updates go through bloomberg only? If we can't track it properly we'd rather just get rid of it.

Oh and side question is there anything faster than Google finance that is also free? We're almost in the top 100 out of 7000 and it's getting quite competitive, we suspect others are using a similar system.",1

The terms of the deal include significant payment installments spread across 4 years, denoted in Euros (non-negotiable).  Since I currently live in the US, all subsequent payments will be converted to USD upon receipt.  Given the recent fluctuations with the Euro and future outlook against the dollar , I'm curious if there are any ways to hedge my position to ensure I don't get burned by a much lower exchange rate in the future?  I'd be happy to lock in today's exchange rate as a guarantee.

Worst case scenario would be EURUSD drops to .85 and our capital gains laws change.  This would essentially give me post-tax 40 - 50% of the value of my package today, making it extremely difficult to plan for the future and difficult to accept knowing I could have done something sooner.

15-12-29,Magnitude of Abnormal Growth in Annual 10 yr Revenue Growth,"When it comes to high growth, highly valued companies, one of the big questions is always whether or not the company can sustain the pace of revenue growth. 

It goes without saying that revenue growth will slow down, that much is an outcome of pure mathematics. The question remains, how quickly does revenue growth fall to the average and what happens when growth reaches the average for the index and the average for the high growth category.

I made this graph to illustrate that change over time. Play around with it and let me know what I can add to it (apart from net income/ebit).

https://infogr.am/magnitude_of_abnormal_growth_in_annual_10_yr_revenue_growth

What is clear from the graph is that the slow down in growth can be quite dramatic and that no industry is spared from it. It also shows that for mature companies, all incremental out performance will come from operational refinements, not revenue growth.

I ran some estimates and it looks like you could insure someone (like a parent) for $2,000,000 from age 60-80 for $800/month ($192k). Using some [rough estimates](http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/Risk/dyingage.html) the odds of a 60-year-old man dying before 80 is still 50.3%.

So what if we invested that money at 10% market returns instead?  Well a 20-year plan with $800 invested each month would be $608k. Add in 10% for tax benefits, and we'll say 670k adjusted return.

Although I think there should be no tax paid on the gains from selling the 50% of the portfolio, Im kinda hesitant to sell more of the position. Any thoughts? Any special tax considerations in general for this situation?

Im hoping the slightly higher yield from the ETFs will give her the chance to withdraw a few thousand in dividends each year while also giving the portfolio some much needed diversification.

Threshold re-allocation: You only rebalance portfolios when allocations deviate from targets by X%, no matter how often or how seldom it may be over time.

Selective Cash Flow Re-Investment: Instead of re-investing dividends and interest into the securities that paid them, you take all as cash, and then selectively re-invest that cash flow towards portfolio laggards, to ""buy-only"" rebalance your portfolio over time, minimizing having to sell anything thereby minimizing taxable events.

* What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
* What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)
* What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
* Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset)
* What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?
* Any big debts?

15-12-30,Icahn confirms to buy Pep Boys in $1.03 billion all-cash deal,"Icahn Enterprises LP IEP, -0.89% confirmed Wednesday that it has agreed to buy The Pep Boys-Manny, Moe &amp; Jack PBY, -2.96% in an all-cash deal valued at $1.03 billion. The news was expected after Japanese tire company Bridgestone Corp. 5108, +0.41% said Tuesday that it would not counter Icahn's latest bid for the auto-parts chain, which pushed the valuation higher than $1 billion. Bridgestone had previously topped two public Icahn offers for the company, but would not step out of the corner for round 3. Icahn will pay $18.50 per Pep Boys share in a deal expected to close in the first quarter. Pep Boys has more than 800 locations in 35 states and Puerto Rico.

15-12-30,Algorithmic trading for beginners?,"I'm interested in whether it is at all possible (or practical) for an individual with a small amount of capital to play around with algorithmic trading, that is, to write your own code that places orders (stocks) based on price data or other information. I'm not talking about high frequency trading, just an automated way to do things.

Of course it is possible to play around with historical or even realtime market data if you just want to see how badly your code would get beaten. However, things are always a bit more interesting when real money is involved, even if the sums are small, and it would be nice to learn if/how it can be done.  In practice, this would require:
1) a broker that offers a suitable interface/API that allows placing orders from a custom code written in e.g. matlab or python.  
2) offers reasonable fees and transaction costs to do 1, and doesn't require huge capital deposits.

Does such a broker exist?

I realize this is may not be strictly investing related, but maybe someone could offer some pointers on where to look?",2
15-12-30,13%+ Secured Loan for Profitable Events Business on Funding Circle Looks Undervalued,"Spotted this on funding circle the other day, looks undervalued compared to other higher FC-rated loans.

https://www.fundingcircle.com/loans/90629/auction

5Y £200,000 D-rated (~14%) secured loan taken out for this events company called Off Limits Corporate Events Ltd. (https://www.offlimits.co.uk/) This same company has previously taken out 3 A-rated (~8%) loans with funding circle that have all been repaid. This company looks relatively well established with 14Y in business with large corporate clients such as RBS, Vodafone, EDF etc.

In its last filed accounts on Dec 2014, the company had 4M turnover with 180k profit after tax. Annual payments for the loan is 65k pa. The company changed its year end in 2013 and even with a shortened accounting period of Mar 2013-Dec 2013, the company made 84k profit. Enough to cover any loan repayments.

Net assets is at 580k - given the loan is secured on its assets, this can be sold at a 65% discount and still cover the loan.(https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04147578/charges/9-A_ZYC86Z7p4ioUwFvFO8yCTig)

Net current asset is -155k, which is probably one of the motivations for this loan. 

Overall, the financial risk for this company is comparable to other A rated secured loans on FC, which implies ~9%. Currently the loan parts are trading at 13.3%, which is a 1.5% premium. What do you guys think?",0

15-12-30,ESPP Question,"Hey everyone, 

So I wanted to get some suggestions on my family financial/investment situation. My wife's company offers a ESPP that would allow her to contribute up to the $25,000 federal maximum for purchase in employee stock. I wanted to know if you guys think this is a good idea given our present financial situation. 

ESPP Program Specifics: 
You may elect to participate in one or both of the two separate
“purchase right periods” for each year (both apply to the $25k yearly max):
a) January 1 through December 31, or
b) July 1 through December 31

During the year, you set money aside to purchase stock at the
end of the year. You may set money aside:
– Through after-tax payroll deductions of a certain amount
each pay period
– Through a lump-sum deposit
– Through a combination of both

HOWEVER, stock is purchased ONLY on DECEMBER 31 at the LESSER of

a) The closing price on the first day of the purchase right period
(i.e. January 1 or July 1), or
b) 15% off the closing price on December 31.

Your shares will be issued to a book entry account in your name within 45 days after your purchase on December 31. I WOULD SELL THE SHARES ASAP TO LIMIT EXPOSURE. 

My wife and I both make ~55,000/year gross. I contribute to a 401k (just enough to receive employer match) but her work does not offer a 401k match, we both max out or ROTH IRAs. Our expenses are low enough that I believe we could contribute the full $25,000 for the ESPP program however it would be tight. My questions are 

1. Should we consider contributing to the 25k match? (Large portion of our net income ~35%)
2. Should we not start until the July 1 purchase right period so the money would be held up for 6 months instead of 1 year?
3. The 45 day lag time scares me however, given the 15% discount I would hope that would be enough to protect against sudden market drops.

Value, Large-cap, Dividend-paying with appropriate DD.","It's a slow day in the office and market, so I thought I would share the stocks I plan to buy January 5th. My plan is to hold these 10 stocks for the next 1-3 years. I will be putting $1000 into each stock. My wife and I already hold the bulk of our retirement funds in diversified index funds. This money will be in a taxable Robinhood account. I will include a brief DD I have done on each stock.

About me: I am a 28 year old amateur investor with 6+ years experience, and a background/interest in statistics. My goal is to maintain steady capital appreciation through a diversified set of 10 individual stocks. I favor under-valued large companies. Hopefully from my write up, you will see some of the financial statistics I look for when I screen companies. I believe 6 out of 10 of my holdings are undervalued at current levels. Please feel free to critique this portfolio and any companies in in it. 

1. Cisco Systems (CSCO)  -  Cisco is the leader in networking and IP security equipment. Look at your office's phones, servers, routers, switches, and web conferencing software, Cisco's name is most likely on that product. I believe they are currently **undervalued**. Forward PE of 11.33, profit margins of 19.33%, high levels of cash to debt (3.35), and an effective management team resulting in a return on equity of 16.42%. Cisco's dividend keeps growing, and it currently yields 3.08%. Their stock price is down ~2% YTD. 

2. Honda Motor Company (HMC) - Honda is known for producing efficient, reliable cars, trucks, and motorcycles. They dominate the US with the Accord, Civic, and CR-V. They will be re-entering the truck market with the Ridgeline in 2017. I have always found Hondas to hit that sweet point with price, reliability, and smart design. I believe Honda is currently **undervalued**. Forward PE of 11.46, price to book value of .97; price to sales of .47. The vehicle business is competitive, however their profit margins (4.86%) and return on equity (8.86%) are above industry standards. They have 8.86B in operating cash flow. Dividend yields 2.2%. Stock is up 8% YTD, but down ~20% over the past 5 years.

3. Royal Dutch Shell (RDS.A) - Shell is a huge integrated energy company. I believe it is **probably undervalued**. This is based on the fact that I believe oil prices will stabilize in the next coming years. I think we will see a further short-term dip to oil prices around $25-30. I usually would wait for a better entry point, but the dividend yield (8.18%) is too tempting. Shell is trading under book value (.90). It still is inching out a small profit. Perhaps the biggest plus to shell is its large cash reserves (31B) and operating cash flow of (34B). I like shell as a play on oil prices rising. Shell is down 33% YTD.

4. Tesoro (TSO) - Tesoro is my hedge against oil prices staying where they are/going lower. Tesoro is a refining company that I found through some /r/investing posts (thanks!). Refiners will continue to do well with lower oil prices, and statistically-wise, they are the best refiner in the US. I believe they are **fairly-priced**. They have a forward PE of 11.53 and trade for a little over 2x's book value. Profits have grown 91% yoy. Management has been highly effective with their cash (return on equity 25.75%). They have more debt than cash on hand, but still operate with an operating cash flow of 2.16B. Dividend yield 1.94%. They are up 46% YTD

5. Travelers Companies (TRV) -Travelers is an insurance company. I've personally used them, and found their prices and customer service to be amazing. I wanted exposure to the insurance industry due to rising interest rates. This will allow insurance companies to profit more on the insurance premiums they collect.  Travelers seemed the most **under-valued** in the insurance industry. They have a forward PE of 11.57, price to book of 1.45. Profit margins of 13.62%. Management has been effective with capital resulting in a return on equity of 14.63%. Dividend yield of 2.17%. Travelers is up 6.86% YTD.

6. Western Digital Corp (WDC) - The leader in storage devices. This company recently made a splash by acquiring Sandisk to gain broader exposure to the flash storage market. Their main rival is Seagate. Storage needs will only increase as more and more people and companies store and send data intensive files. Our world is only becoming more and more reliant on video-chatting, picture-sharing. New devices like smartphones, automated cars, and oculus will only continue consuming data. That data will need to be stored somewhere. The storage industry is becoming increasingly more consolidated. I really believe the industry is at the start of a huge transition. I believe WDC is **undervalued**. They have a forward PE of 8.16, price to sales of 1.01, PB of 1.51. Profit margin of 9.47%, Return on Equity of 14.48%. Their cash exceeds debt with a ratio of 2.68. Dividend yields 3.32%. WDC is down 45% YTD. 

7. Walmart (WMT) - The retailing giant is down 28.55% YTD largely in result to Walmart deciding to raise the pay of their minimum wage workers. This has affected quarterly YoY earnings growth (-11%). Despite the investment in their workers, I believe Walmart to be **undervalued**. They have a forward PE of 14.69, price to sales of .41, price to book 2.49 (lowest in industry). Profit margins are at 3.12%. Management has always been effective with a return on equity of 18.62%. Dividend yields 3.24%. They have tons of cash flow with an operating cash flow of 28.10B. Walmart benefits from low oil prices. They have a decent online shopping system. I expect their investment in workers to start attracting new customers. 

8. Visa (V) - Visa is a cash cow that takes 2.5% every time you swipe a credit card. They benefit tremendously from the rise of online shopping. Most people I know rarely carry cash. If you travel to under-developed countries, you will see the growth in more and more businesses accepting Visa. People have caught on to this amazing business model, and thus Visa is **over-valued**. Their forward PE of 23 is just slightly above the S*P 500's PE of 21. It trades at 6x's book value (ouch). For this high valuation, you get profit margins of 45.59%, and return on equity of 22.11%. The company has 0 debt, and pays a tiny dividend of .72%. Visa is up 19% YTD. I hate buying over-valued companies, but they are an excellent company, and I do not see them making a significant pull-back anytime soon. 

9. Nike (NKE) - Nike is the world-wide leader in athletic shoes and sports apparel. Similar to Visa they are very **over-valued**, but I want in. They have a forward PE of 25. Price to book of 8. Profit margins of 11.55%. They have stellar management with a return on equity of 28.84%. Their apparel is starting to catch on in under-developed markets, and they boast quarterly YoY growth of 20%. They pay a small dividend of .97%. More cash than debt with a ratio of 3. I'm honestly not sure if Nike is worth the high price. They are up 30% YTD. 

10. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) - Johnson&amp;Johnson is your friendly maker of Tylenol, Band-Aid, Benadryl, Neutrogena, and countless other consumer staples. I chose JNJ as protection in case the market has a broad decline in 2016/2017. Most likely they are **fairly-valued**. JNJ has a forward PE of 16. They have high profit margins (20%) and return on equity (19.87%). They have more cash than debt (2.51). They trade 4x's book value. Their dividend is a rock solid 2.92%. JNJ is down 1.4% YTD. 

My biggest concern right now is that I do not have any price targets set, so I'm not sure at what price I would sell my stocks. This is probably something I should research more into before my purchases. I appreciate any feedback. Hopefully this write-up will help you in becoming a better investor. ",733

15-12-31,How does a stock have positive returns when the overall points are low given a one year timeline. Is it reinvested income? What exactly is reinvested income?,"Hello all,

So I am wondering how a stock can make a positive return in 1 year with the end of the year being lower than the beginning. I think it has to do something with re-invested income, but am not sure.

for example:

$10,000 invested into Stock A at 11.72 1 year ago. 1 year later, the same stock is worth 11.59, but with a 10,000 dollar investment it shows a 7.05% return positive making the net-gain 10,705.00 CAD.

I am asking how this is possible? 

Thanks in advance",4

15-12-31,Why Amazon is the best investment for 2016 and how it will eventually take over the world.,"I made a lot of money on Amazon last year. I intend to keep holding my shares. Here's why I think that Amazon is the best investment for 2016:

**Major catalysts in online retail** 

Here's the thing, online retail in the US is still a growing market. And Amazon is increasing their share of that growing pie. Per an article in today's [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/technology/in-online-race-its-amazon-and-also-rans.html?_r=0):

&gt;Of every additional $1 Americans spent for items online this year, Amazon captured 51 cents, according to a recent estimate by analysts at Macquarie Research.

And furthermore:

&gt;Over all, Amazon’s share of United States e-commerce sales jumped to 26 percent this year from 22 percent last year, and 16 percent in 2011, according to Macquarie estimates.

As you can see, America is hooked on Amazon. Every single day I go into my apartment building, I see a stack of Amazon packages in the mail room. Not so much for other e-commerce companies like Wayfair or Jet or whatever.

**Prime Expansion**

Amazon Prime is nothing short of genius. It keeps people hooked on Amazon, and keeps them ordering things on Amazon. That is why revenues have increased so much over the past few years - people will buy something from Amazon, even if it costs a few dollars more, because they know they will get it in a timely manner.

Furthermore, with improvements to infrastructure and the advent of Prime Now, Amazon will finally be able to take on grocery stores by offering fast delivery of everything, immediately to a consumer's doorstep. 

Once enough of the world population is hooked on Prime, Amazon will be able to raise prices on Prime. And who will dump Prime? 

**Prime Video**

Amazon's *The Man in the High Castle* demonstrates that it can take on Netflix in the online streaming arena. With time and development of even more original series, Amazon could easily overtake Netflix because they have more money and are better funded. 

**Amazon Web Services**

This is the elephant in the room. My software developer friends and the companies they work for love AWS. They can deploy internal web apps on the fly. In fact, AWS helps power half of the Internet, including Reddit. Microsoft and IBM and all those traditional companies just can't keep up. 

With such name brand recognition and great technology, I see AWS continuing to be a catalyst for increases in Amazon's stock price. 

**Amazon vs. UPS**

Lots has been written about Amazon building out its own delivery network. In fact, some of my packages from Amazon are being delivered via Amazon's internal delivery service, which operates out of their warehouses. 

Logistics is not easy, but it's the key to Amazon's future. I hope that Amazon uses its clout to build out a UPS and Fedex competitor, for it will force those companies to innovate and lower their fees. 

In ten years, once Amazon has completely fleshed out its delivery network, there is no doubt in my mind that it will ultimately decreases costs in the long term. They will have control over the network that makes them the most desirable place to shop online. 

**Conclusion**

There are a lot of naysayers that say that Amazon doesn't have any profits or whatever. Well, Amazon is a stock that breaks all the traditional rules of valuation. They are clearly in a growth phase, building out all the infrastructure that's needed to dominate online retail in North America. Once everything is in place, they can easily raise prices - and people won't have a choice as Amazon has killed off all the big competition. 

Now, I'm not a Wall Street analyst or anything, just an average Joe, but I think that Amazon could easily hit $1,000 a share by the end of 2016. And who knows where it will go in 2017. All I know is that it will keep going up and up and up because Amazon has such great mindshare among online shoppers and the infrastructure they have in place ensures that no other company can come close to the convenience that is Amazon.com.

Her 401k is through Merril Lynch.  She was given 5 options and a small pdf about them.  The pdfs don't really explain much.  They do show a 'Portfolio Snapshot'  which from what I can gather is just hypothetical way to construct your portfolio.  

'This report is one of the brokerage reports available that offers a closer look at the hypothetical portfolio presented, including the individual investments comprising the portfolio. The report
does not constitute a formal recommendation, but rather should be used to facilitate a discussion about your investment strategy with your Financial Advisor. Any action taken should be done
considering your overall financial goals, investment objectives, and tolerance for risk.'

Her 5 options are Aggressive, Moderate Aggressive, Moderate, Moderate Conservative and Conservative.  Which really doesn't mean anything to me.  I wasn't able to find an expense ratio in the paperwork anywhere.

Also the wording makes me wonder if we could just tell them what to invest in and just hold onto some of the Vanguard ETFs since they don't seem to offer any passively managed index funds.

My only knowledge on stocks and investing come from The Little Book of Common Sense Investing which really hammers home how much better holding an index fund is compared to actively managed funds.  But that doesn't seem to be an option with these guys.  I hope this all makes sense.  


Edit: 
She received these emails several months ago when first setting up the account.  1.5% seems absurdly high.

'We haven’t gotten into the investment options with my last email to you, but we run a handful of investment models that range from Conservative to Aggressive with all points in-between. The cost for us to run these investment models is 1.5%, and the investments themselves average an expense ratio of .2%-.35%. We actively manage these investments and make changes periodically as we see best; this is why I list the second set of numbers as a range rather than a specific amount.'

When she asked about low cost Index Funds she received this response:

'Actually all of these investment models are based on lower cost index funds. They each cover a very diverse variety of ETFs that vary a bit in allocation as the models go from conservative to more aggressive.

Please do note that we manage the portfolios at a cost however, of 1.5% of the account value annually, charged monthly.'

Edit2:  So I think what is happening is that her 401k has to go through this financial adviser guy who is charging 1.5% to 'manage' the portfolio.  While not actually doing anything else for her.  I'm going to look into it and see if we must go through him (although I'm guessing we do).",15

15-12-31,3 Easy Ways to Start Saving for Retirement (for Teenagers and Millennials),"I have no clue what retirement is like. I don’t even like to think about what retirement means.

I’m 20, I’m young, and for me retirement is way off somewhere in the distant future.

A recent report from the Insured Retirement Institute (IRI) and the Center for Generational Kinetics shed some light on the savings habits of individuals aged 20-37. According to the study, 68% of millennials are actively saving for their retirement.

That is awesome. That means that even though thinking about retirement is weird, people are doing it.

In this post I will outline what tools are available for you to start saving for retirement. I will stay away from giving investment advice, rather I will focus on the different ways retirement accounts can save you money and protect your future.

**1. Open a Roth IRA**

*DEFINITION OF ROTH IRA*
&gt;An individual retirement plan that bears many similarities to the traditional IRA, but contributions are not tax deductible and qualified distributions are tax free. Similar to other retirement plan &gt;accounts, non-qualified distributions from a Roth IRA may be subject to a penalty upon withdrawal.

A Roth Independent Retirement Account (IRA) is a millennials most effective tool to save for retirement. A Roth IRA is a special type of investment account. You can take the money you put into a Roth IRA and invest in Nike, Apple, Google, a mutual fund, index fund, exchange traded fund, or even bonds. You can do whatever you want with this money once it is in this account.

What makes a Roth ideal for retirement savings is the fact that you contribute after tax dollars. This means that when you withdraw earnings at age 59 1/2 or older you will not be taxed again. There is flexibility though if you want to withdraw money before your 60th birthday, you can always remove the initial capital you invested without penalty, just not the earnings accrued from that money.

A Roth allows you to contribute a maximum of $5500 a year to it, with no aggregate cap. (There is no maximum cap for how much money can be in the account).

Let’s look at an example.

Imagine you make a single $5500 contribution at age 20. 40 years go by and you did not make any other contributions to that account, but you did re-invest your dividends. How much would that $5500 be worth in 40 years? Imagine you return a measly 4% on your capital each year. How much would that add up to in 40 years?

**$26,405.61**

What if you could afford to contribute $5500 each year from 20 to 60 years old. How much would that money be worth when you are 60, let’s again assume a small return of 4% annually?

**$569,951.56**

And, let’s say we manage to do well in the market and hit a 7% return on our investment each year. What would that put us at?

**$1,257,212.15**

Of course, these same returns could be made in a traditional investment account, but remember the benefits of the Roth IRA. In our last example we invested $220,000 dollars from age 20 to age 60. Of that, our investments made a little over 1 million dollars. In a traditional investment account that income would be taxed at between 15% and 20%. With the Roth IRA that income is not taxed.

That is great, a Roth IRA shields you from being taxed on capital gains when you are older. The benefit there seems pretty self-explanatory. But what if you can’t afford to invest $5500?

**2. Open a myRA**

&gt;Unlike other Roth IRAs, myRA has features designed to make it a starter retirement savings account. myRA is invested in a single United States Treasury retirement savings bond, which will &gt;not lose money and is backed by the United States Treasury. Money that you put in your myRA will earn interest until your account reaches $15,000 or 30 years from the day you first fund the &gt;account (whichever comes first). The account balance will then be transferred to a private-sector Roth IRA, where you can continue to invest your savings and make additional contributions. &gt;You can also transfer or roll over your myRA to a private-sector Roth IRA of your choice at any time.

If you are not capable of investing $5500 at a time in a Roth IRA then the myRA is for you.

The myRA is a federally backed retirement savings account. The myRA is intended for low-income individuals who cannot afford to save large chunks of money at once.

The myRA has the exact same tax benefits of the Roth IRA. You contribute after tax income and are able to remove that money after age 59 1/2 or older without being taxed.

The key differences between the Roth IRA and the myRA are:

* Maximum total contribution of $15,000
* 30 year max lifespan of the account
* You do not choose where the money is invested

Contributions are invested in the United States Treasury Bond. The myRA website explains how that works:

&gt;The money you put in your myRA account is invested in a United States Treasury savings bond, that safely earns interest at the same variable rate as investments in the Government &gt;Securities Fund for federal employees. The return for these investments was 2.31% in 2014 and 3.19% over the ten-year period ending December 2014. Past performance is not a guarantee &gt;of or prediction of current or future performance.

After saving money in your myRA you can roll it over to a Roth IRA and continue saving.

**3. Use your 401k**

&gt;A qualified plan established by employers to which eligible employees may make salary deferral (salary reduction) contributions on a post-tax and/or pretax basis. Employers offering a 401(k) &gt;plan may make matching or non-elective contributions to the plan on behalf of eligible employees and may also add a profit-sharing feature to the plan. Earnings accrue on a tax-deferred basis.

If you have just completed college and landed your first salaried position you should be investing in your company’s 401k plan.

With a 401k your investment options may be limited, and there are most likely restrictions on when and how you can withdraw assets without penalties. But, 401k plans generally are matched by employers.

Matching is when your employer contributes money to your retirement account. The most common practice is for employers to match 100% of the first 6% you contribute.

For example, if you make $50,000 a year and contribute $3,000 (6%) to your 401k your employer would contribute another $3,000 as a match. You just made $3,000 by saving for your retirement. Independent retirement accounts cannot provide you this benefit, only 401k’s and other employer related retirement accounts.

**Conclusion**

Saving money for the distant future is not all that sexy.

Just know that by starting young you are setting yourself up for success. No matter what investment vehicle you choose your future self will thank you.",13

15-12-31,120 Shares of DIS in Paper Certificate Form (3 Certs),"Sorry for semi-redundant topical post. I've read all the other posts on Disney paper certificates.

However, I own a slightly more significant chunk than 18 shares, the highest number I've seen posted about so far - https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/3sifc4/selling_disney_stock_in_paper_form_thats_ugma_in/

I am in a similar situation (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act).  However, no problem with getting my mother's name off the stocks. Simple solution, right? Send copy of birth certificate to Broadridge Corporate Investor Relations.  Have had all paperwork ready to do that for months and opened account at a bank that does Medallion Signature Guarantee.   All is ready to sell, however I'm wondering if anyone has advice or additional instruction on transferring/selling.

- 1987 - gifted 10 shares in paper form
- 1992 - 4/1 split, received additional paper certificate for 30 shares
- 1998 - 3/1 split, received additional paper certificate for 80 shares

- Currently hold 120 shares, in the form of 3 certificates (as of writing this post) worth ~$12,700.  Was planning to sell some or all to pay for a major surgery coming up.
- Then learned that in 2013 the company stopped issuing paper certificates.
- Now, a friend tells me she is looking to invest not only for financial gain, but also in memorium of a child who recently passed, so she wants the paper certificate for intrinsic/sentimental value reasons.
- Some online speculation that DIS will split again in near future, and paper certificates themselves (regardless of stock price) will eventually become massively valuable***
- Would like to retain at least the original 10 shares in paper certificate form as a memento, as it has hung on my wall framed, because my favorite grandfather originally gifted it to me.
- Broadridge customer service tells me there is no way to release custodian's name from account *AND* keep copies of the paper certificates -OR- ever have aforementioned friend's name on a paper certificate (see: they stopped issuing paper in 2013).

***I don't get involved in speculations and stock-gossip, don't believe there is a split coming any time soon ""just because stock is over $100/share"".  (It was at $117/share a couple weeks ago, Star Wars Episode Whatever was just released, stock price was well over $150 in the 90's and didn't split...and bombing of Agrabah may be eminent.)  I am not banking on the certificates themselves increasing wildly in intrinsic value in the next few decades any more than I bank on collecting stamps or wheat pennies (I don't collect either) to ""plan for retirement"".

Wondering what best course of action would be...

- a) sign transfer on back of one of the certificates over to my friend (like a car title) in exchange for a mutually agreed price, so that she holds shares equal to the number that certificate bears as well as certificate itself (with my name on it, not hers).  She would then possess the certificate itself until she wishes to cash out.
- b) file for lost certificate on all 3 certificate, have all 120 shares transferred digitally, keep certificates for intrinsic value
- c) file for lost certificate on 2/3 certificates, keep only the original 10-share certificate for intrinsic/sentimental value, sell any number of remaining 110 shares at will (or never)
- d) hold on to all 3 certificates and all 120 shares and find another way of paying for surgery
- e) other suggestions/workarounds?

Any and all advice welcome.  Thanks in advance, and feel free to point me to any other posts or links I may have missed in my previous Google/reddit-scouring.

I'm so used to the idea of buying several stocks priced at a few hundred dollars a piece (public stocks). Also what happens when you have a private stock and then the company decides to go public with its stock? Would love any advice/help/answers that I could get!",3

15-12-30,TSLA Bearish Option Opportunity: Jan 8 Put,"Many indicators point to a short-term bearish sentiment for TSLA. After some basic TA, I noticed the following:

1. TSLA's current price is around $240.4 (as of Wednesday Dec 30), and is at the upper bollinger band.
2. Trend lines indicate a semi-accurate upper resistance line; the stock follows this channel quite well. (see chart)
3. I believe the MACD is always slightly behind, so I would count this as a slightly weaker, but still significant indicator of a bearish sentiment. It appears to be approaching a bearish cross soon.
4. The RSI is at a peak, which indicates that the stock is overbought.

Opposition:
-The new year may bring excitement to the market, and inflate the price of the stock next week
-The IV is pretty huge right now, which may cause higher premiums and crush overall profits.

15-12-30,Protecting Savings from Inflation - US TIPS?,"I have some cash that has accumulated to the point that inflation is starting to cost me some real money. This is money I want to keep as ""cash"" as much as possible. i.e., I'm not looking to stick it into the market. I would, however, like to not lose 1.5-2.5% per year of purchasing power. It's too much for I bonds to be helpful, so I've been thinking about TIPS, but the associated tax complications sound kind of bad (""Phantom Income"" tax being the worst), and I don't know that I want to lock the money up for 5 years - being forced to sell it on the secondary market would be just like buying a stock (i.e., the value on the secondary market could be lower than I paid, defeating the purpose of buying in the first place), but with a really crappy expected return. So, I'm a little stuck.

Does anyone know a good way to protect this cash against inflation?

15-12-30,"Amazon's accounts payable and operating cash flow.","Hello all,

I was reading through this article about Amazon's cash flow and it noted that Amazon takes a long time to pay its suppliers. That piqued my curiosity a bit. The article is here:

https://hbr.org/2014/10/at-amazon-its-all-about-cash-flow/

&gt;Actually, though, it isn’t inventory management that distinguishes Amazon from Walmart and Costco. Walmart has an “inventory velocity” similar to Amazon’s while Costco, with its limited selection, turns its inventory substantially faster. Walmart and Costco also both get paid by customers more quickly than Amazon does. Where Amazon stands out is how excruciatingly long it takes it to pay its suppliers — 95.8 days on average last year, according to Morningstar, compared with 30.1 for Costco and 38.5 for Walmart.

Now, per basic accounting, if your accounts payable increases between periods, that is considered an increase to operating cash flow. 

Now, logically, it makes sense. If you book an expense on an accrual basis for the current period, but it takes 90 days for you to make the cash outlay to pay for that expense, then you should add back the increase in accounts payable to net income since booking that expense doesn't result in an actual cash outlay for the period. 

However, the way some people think about it - you can't stretch your payables forever. If you are a decent company that wants to protect and maintain the relationships you have with your suppliers, you will pay what you owe before too long. 

Hence, I believe that in evaluating companies that buy up lots of inventory on trade credit, you really shouldn't rely too heavily on what the cash flow statement tells you - ultimately, earnings may tell the best story, and unfortunately, in Amazon's case, their earnings are minimal. 

Moral of the story? Yes, operating cash flow is harder to manipulate. However, it can be manipulated from an operational sense, like pressuring customers to pay quickly or stretching out your payables. 

I'm not a sophisticated investor. But all this recent discussion about Amazon has gotten me to read numbers far more carefully when making decisions about a company, rather than just taking things at face value. ",14

Would anyone be able to give me some idea of how I can evaluate the validity of an Income Statement using the Balance Sheet? In basic terms, I'm looking for a reasonable way to check that EPS as reported isn't way off the mark due to creative manipulation.

Can the taxation liabilities presented on the Balance Sheet be used for this purpose? My thought being that taxes payable should give a fairly reasonable outline of profit, in turn comparable to reported EPS. At present, one potential issue I can see with this approach stems from the fact that businesses frequently deploy a slew of credits and deferrals during taxation which may make tax liabilities difficult to compare to reported profit.
